My name is Cole, and I will be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference.  And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, proceed.\nAndrew Simanek: Hey. Thanks, Cole. Good afternoon, everyone. I am Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished the year with a very strong performance. In Q4 we saw a notable rebound in our overall revenue with particular acceleration in key growth areas of our business.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. I will start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I will be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on slide four, so now let me discuss our financial performance starting with slide five. I am very pleased to report that Q4 marked a return of revenue to pre-pandemic levels. We delivered Q4 revenues of $7.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and flat from a prior year period as our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC & MCS executed strongly. We also cleared our backlog by further $250 million during the quarter, which has now returned to normalize levels as we exited Q4. As a result of the improved revenue performance, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 7% sequentially to $2.2 billion in Q4. Non GAAP gross margins of 30.6% were also up sequentially driven by positive mix shift towards Intelligent Edge, Storage and HPC/MCS, all of which reported strong sequential revenue growth. Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 15% sequentially, resulting in a 7.7% operating margin and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.37, was up 16% sequentially. Q4 cash flow from operations was $747 million, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $223 million and that was in line with our guidance, as we saw the expected reversal in the favorable working capital movements from elevated backlog in Q3. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q1 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in January 2021. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment highlights in slides six and seven. As you can see, we are doing exactly what we said we would do at SAM in October. We are doubling down on our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC/MCS, while stabilizing our core business segments of Compute and Storage. In Intelligent Edge, we continued our momentum with 14% quarter-over-quarter and 5% year-over-year growth. We also expect to take share in both campus switching and wireless LAN with our best-in-class portfolio, which was just recognized as a leader for the 15th year in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless LAN access infrastructure. We are also beginning to see the operating profit potential of this business, with operating margin in Q4 of 10.1%, up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 390 basis points year-over-year as we drove greater productivity from prior investments in this business. Finally, we closed the Silver Peak acquisition on September 21st, so it had a minimal contribution in Q4, but obviously Silver Peak will be more meaningful going forward. In HPC & MCS, revenue reached record levels near $1 billion, growing 50% sequentially and 25% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in Cray, HPC Apollo and MCS. We executed well against our existing order book with increased customer acceptances and grew orders further with a healthy pipeline. As you know, this business can be lumpy with revenue recognition and profitability linked to completion of critical customer milestones. While we do expect to see a normal seasonal decline in Q1 \u201821, we are well on our way to delivering our 8% to 12% three-year revenue CAGR outlined at SAM. In Compute, revenue declined 7% sequentially, but was up low-single digits when normalizing Q3 and Q4 results for backlog conversion. Gross and operating margins were also pressured by clearing the backlog as we had to fulfill orders at cost levels higher than originally quoted. We are pleased to report that backlog has now returned to normalized levels. Thanks to continued improvements in our supply chain execution. Within Storage, we grew revenue 7% quarter-over-quarter driven by strong operational execution, reduced backlog and improved order momentum in key areas of the portfolio. We saw notable strength in big data, up 27% sequentially driven by increased customer focus on AI machine learning related applications, all-flash array storage up 19% sequentially by increase -- driven by increased adoption of Primera all-flash and dHCI, which grew double digits sequentially. We also expanded operating margins this quarter, which was up 380 basis points quarter-on-quarter ending at 16.7% of revenue and already aligned to our SAM fiscal year \u201823 targets. With respect to Pointnext Operational Services, which is included across our Compute, HPC/MCS and Storage segments, total revenue was up 2%, while orders were down 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware units sold continued to be strong with notable strength in Compute and Storage, excluding Nimble, which were up low-single digits growth on a sequential basis. In Advisory and Professional Services, revenue was up 6% sequentially, even as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 6% and revenue was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, despite the impact of COVID-19. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 1.06%, which while slightly higher than previous quarters is still best-in-class and well within our comfort zone, as cash collections have already returned back to pre-COVID levels. In our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investments segment, orders were up 18% and revenue was up 6% sequentially, driven by strong double-digit orders and revenue growth in Americas. Additionally, due to our improved cost of delivery, we were able to expand operating margins by 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco network functions. Slide eight shows key metrics of our growing as-a-service business, which I elaborated on during our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. We are making great strides in our AAS offering. I am pleased to report that our Q4 \u201820 ARR came in at $585 million, representing 11% quarter-over-quarter and 30% year-over-year reported growth. Total as-a-service orders were up 20% year-over-year, driven by outstanding performance in North America and APJ. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform also continued to grow revenues strong double digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is delivering and progressing towards its ARR growth targets of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year \u201820 fiscal year \u201823, set at our 2019 SAM and reiterated at our 2020 SAM meeting. Slide nine highlights our revenue and EPS performance to-date, where you can clearly see Q2 was a trough. Strong operational execution has driven sequential revenue growth from a low of $6 billion in Q2 all the way back to $7.2 billion in Q4. Turning to slide 10, the rebound in revenue has resulted in a 15% improvement in non-GAAP gross profit from the Q2 trough, which was up to $2.2 billion in Q4. Also, the gross margin rate in Q4 of 30.6% of revenues was up 20 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of Intelligent Edge, Storage and HPC/MCS, which are higher margin businesses, offset by continued execution of elevated Compute backlog, which was a headwind but is now behind us. Moving to slide 11, you can see how the improvement in gross profit combined with progress on our cost optimization plan has delivered 53% growth in operating profit from the Q2 trough, while still investing for growth. As mentioned at SAM, we are making excellent progress in our cost optimization and prioritization plan, which will strengthen our financial foundation, while aligning resources to critical growth areas. As of the end of this quarter, we are on track to deliver annualized net run rate savings for at least $800 million from the FY \u201819 baseline by the end of fiscal year \u201822, with most of the savings being realized by the end of fiscal year \u201821. Obviously, we will keep you updated on our progress in the upcoming quarters. Turning to slide 12, we generated cash flow from operations of $747 million and free cash flow was $223 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements from clearing backlog that resulted in favorability in Q3, but a headwind we flagged for in Q4. We ended fiscal year \u201820 with free cash flow of $560 million in line with our outlook provided at SAM 2020. Looking to \u201821, we expect free cash flow to grow over 75% at the midpoint of our outlook of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Please remember our normal cash flow seasonality where the second half is a stronger generator of cash flow than the first half. Now moving on to slide 13, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position, which is a competitive advantage in the current environment. As our October 31st quarter end, we had approximately $4.2 billion of cash after successfully redeeming $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020 and paying approximately $853 million net of cash, excuse me, $853 of net cash for closing the Silver Peak transaction. Together, with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $9 billion of liquidity. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating, which was recently reaffirmed by the rating agencies. Bottomline, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operation, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy. Now turning to outlook on slide 14, at our recent Securities Analyst Meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year \u201821 and I would encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. Having said that, let me drill down on a few key areas. We continue to expect to grow our fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP operating profit by 15% to 20% and now expect FY \u201821 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $1.60 to $1.78, as a result of increased confidence in margin improvement. This is a $0.03 per share improvement on the midpoint of our prior guidance of a $1.56 to $1.76 in EPS. From a topline perspective, we are pleased with the rebound we saw in Q4 and continue to see gradual improvement, but want to remain somewhat cautious due to the uncertain pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically for Q1 \u201821, after normalizing for excess backlog reduction in Q4 \u201820 of $250 million, we expect Q1 \u201821 revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q4. For fiscal year \u201821, we expect total revenue to be in line with our long-term financial targets of a CAGR of 1% to 3% presented in our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. For Q1 \u201821, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.02 to $0.06 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.40 to $0.44. So overall, I am very pleased with the performance in the quarter and execution against our strategy and financial priorities outlined at SAM. We have navigated well through unprecedented challenges this fiscal year and had a very strong finish. Q4 was marked by a strong rebound in revenue as we reduced backlog to normalized levels and saw increased order momentum across all business segments. We saw significant acceleration and customer demand in our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC/MCS. Our core business of Compute and Storage is pointing to signs of stabilization and our as-a-service ARR continues to show strong momentum aligned to our outlook. We have been proactive in strengthening our financial foundation and aligning resources to critical areas to transform our core. This will ultimately drive sustainable profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long run. Let me close by reiterating that I am very proud of what we have accomplished as a team during very challenging and uncertain times, and we look forward to fiscal year \u201821. Now with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Thank you.\nOperator:  And our first question today will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to go into the Compute segment a little bit more. First of all, can you talk a little bit about the demand linearity you saw throughout this October quarter? And just as we move forward, how do I think about the operating profitability, if I look back in fiscal \u201819, I think, the average operating margin was somewhere in the 11.5% range, this quarter it was 6%, averaging about 7% this last fiscal year. So I am just trying to understand what is the kind of normalized operating margin profile of that Compute business? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Tarek?\nTarek Robbiati: All right. So, look, if you look at total revenue in Compute, as Antonio said, and I think, I reiterated too, revenue was up low-single digits when you normalize for Q3 and Q4 for backlog conversion, right? So, considering where we were at the end of Q2, the team did an outstanding job of driving supply chain efficiencies and clearing that backlog. The backlog is no more a problem. It\u2019s back to normalized levels. Specifically, with respect to order trends and momentum, order trends were encouraging and then this is pointing to further stabilization in this business. And most importantly, if you look on a combined view for servers across Compute and HPC/MCS, which is how the market tracks server\u2019s performance, our total net revenue in the servers would be up low-single digits sequentially and up low-double digits sequentially, if you exclude the impact of backlog in Q3 and Q4. So we feel we gained revenue market share in total servers for the second consecutive quarter. Now when you look at margins in that context, gross and operating margins were pressurized by clearing backlog as we had to fulfill orders in Q4 at cost levels higher than they were originally quoted. Having said that, we are pleased to report now again that the backlog has returned to normalized levels and we continue to improve our supply chain execution. As we continue to stabilize this business, we expect gross margins to expand now that backlog is no longer an issue and mix shift to more profitable market segments. We also continue to optimize R&D and sales investments, and expect to achieve an operating profit margin of 10% to 12%. This is what we told you as part of our long-term outlook provided at SAM.\nAntonio Neri: So I just want to emphasize a couple of points that I hope that, I think got lost through Tarek\u2019s commentary here, because he provided a lot of insight. Our orders in Compute without China, because as you know we have a difference, it was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, our new orders. And then as we think about the total server category, which is Compute plus HPC plus MCS, you combine all of that and basically when you normalize for the backlog, we would have been up quite a bit sequentially and up low-single digits year-over-year and that\u2019s why we believe we have gained share in total server revenue.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks for the question, Aaron. Operator, can we go to the next one please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could drill down on what\u2019s occurring in the Intelligent Edge business. In particular, we see a couple of crosscurrents, maybe macro recovery would be helpful, but this could be offset by increased work-from-home. So there\u2019s this debate about how this business may trend? And on top of that, I have the impression that you expect to gain market share from some of your larger competitors. I wonder if you could help us understand how you weigh these various crosscurrents when you look out over calendar \u201821 opportunities for the Intelligent Edge? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah. Thank you for the question. I mean, we committed to doubling down on the Edge two years ago, where I went on to state that the Intelligent Edge is the next big frontier. And when you think about digital transformation, all starts with a connectivity. And in order to participate in the digital transformation, you need connectivity, you need security and then ultimately you need to bring the cloud computing, where the data is created and we have now seen that the vast majority of the data is created outside the data center, outside the big cloud and more and more where we live and work. Obviously, the pandemic has validated what I said two years ago that the enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And when I think about our Q4 performance and I am going to speak organically, because the Silver Peak acquisition was just four weeks, five weeks in our numbers. We grew year-over-year versus our competitors in the traditional space whether its Cisco,  orders declined and that\u2019s why we believe we are going to gain share. And the reason why we believe the momentum will continue is not just because of the transformation that we see in customers, particularly as we are going to be in a much more distributed enterprise where connectivity has to be ubiquitous, it\u2019s because we have a cloud native solution. It is important that the street understands our Aruba Edge Services platform is a software company and provides cloud connectivity from the cloud with security, analytics, AI and all the things that you need in this environment at massive scale and it has been designed for devices, people and things. And that\u2019s why we have in that platform today more than 65,000 customers and we are adding 14,000 new devices every single day and that momentum is all about the experience we can provide and this is why we saw the 14% growth sequentially and also we saw the 5% year-over-year growth. But what is interesting is it is a software-as-a-service growth because ultimately that contributes to our ARR. And by the way, our switching was up sequentially high-single digits versus our competitor down and our wireless LAN was up 20% quarter-over-quarter. So, we believe we have something special and unique here right at the middle where the customer demand is. I don\u2019t know, Tarek, if you want to add any commentary.\nTarek Robbiati: That\u2019s absolutely right, Antonio. There\u2019s one thing I can add from a financial standpoint is, we do project that the edge is going to outgrow the market, given the strong differentiation that the Aruba Edge Services platform provides as Antonio described and we see revenue growing at a 6% to 10% CAGR over the next three years from FY \u201820 to FY \u201823 and this will come with enhanced profitability. We ended Q4 with a 10.1% op margin, up 150 basis points. Longer term, we expect operating margins to progress upwards, through the teens with more scale and richer gross margins from higher software content such as the Aruba Services platform including the contribution from Silver Peak.\nAntonio Neri: And I think you should walk away with three key trends, so that you can put that in context. One is, Wi-Fi for secured remote worker solutions. Wi-Fi 6 refresh, which is a pull-through for switching because of the architecture and obviously the acceleration as for SD-WAN, which obviously Silver Peak plays a huge role. And last but not least, we see an increased demand in NaaS, which is network-as-a-service, which obviously is a component of our HPE GreenLake offering.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks for the question, Simon. Operator, can we go to the next one please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi. Yes. Thank you. Congrats on the strong execution and solid quarter. Antonio, you are back at pre-pandemic revenue levels for overall revenue and your growth segments are performing impressively. Do you see this as a sign that enterprise spending is coming back stronger than you thought 90 days ago? And Tarek, if I could, can you just give us an update on the roughly $2 billion of payments that are potentially coming your way from Oracle and how you would deploy that if you got that over the next year? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah. Thanks, Wamsi. I mean I will say we are very encouraged by the all the momentum we have. Obviously, there\u2019s still quite a bit of uncertainty out there. We are still subscribed to our thesis that Tarek and I discussed in Q2 which is a U shaped recovery. But what I am really pleased is that order momentum and the sequential growth that we continue to see, and the demand particularly in the growth areas, but also very pleased with what is pointed to the stabilization of the core business. The fact that our Compute orders grew sequentially 2% is very, very good. We also saw a sequential growth in Storage in orders and I think it\u2019s pointed to different solutions, Wamsi. Obviously, we see in our containers, we see bare metal applications, we see everything that\u2019s workload optimized, data recovery is one aspect of it, VDI is another aspect of it. I think there is a shift in not just buying infrastructure, but that type of infrastructure which is way more optimized. And one of the things we see obviously is GreenLake. GreenLake is a driving force for pulling through our portfolio and when you pull that portfolio through, Compute and Storage win and that\u2019s where we discussed at SAM, not only we need to focus on the stabilization, but the transformation of that business to become more software and silicon-oriented, which the example of that is we introduced our Silicon Root of Trust Version 2.0, which is the most secure platform on the planet. But what is interesting, if you listen to some of our competitors, including today, they say that 96% of the spend is still on-prem. This is not my words. It\u2019s a big cloud provider who said that. And that transition is an important transition for us to capture and that\u2019s where we went ahead with our on-premise solutions as-a-service. So that\u2019s where I think there is definitely stabilization in demand. There is increased demand in certain areas associated with connectivity, AI, data. We see more workload optimized solution. We see more IT resiliency needed at this point in time and that\u2019s where, as we enter Q1, we enter with a very strong momentum on orders and that\u2019s where we were confident with Tarek to raise our guidance for the year. Oracle?\nTarek Robbiati: Wamsi, so the question on Oracle. So, yes, we have not forgotten about that one, of course. Let me remind everybody where we stand. There was a $3 billion roughly jury verdict in HPE\u2019s favor in the Itanium matter. That matter remains on appeal. The renewed judgment now stands at $3.8 billion in total with interest accruing at 10% since May 2019, so an interesting interest rate here. The appeal has been fully briefed and we are awaiting the California Court of Appeal to schedule oral arguments. Although, we are hopeful that we will receive a ruling from the California Court of Appeal in 2021, obviously the timing of this is out of our control. We remain confident that the outcome on appeal will be favorable to HPE and also I want to remind you all that we would have to share any sort of payment with our cousins at HP Inc.\nAntonio Neri: Correct. Thanks, Wamsi.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Yeah. Thanks, Wamsi. Can we go to the next question please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Liu: Hi. Thanks. This is Irvin Liu dialing in for Amit. I wanted to get an update on your HPC & MCS business. During your recent Analyst Day, you alluded to this business in addition to Intelligent Edge being contributors to growth and clearly this quarter puts an emphasis on that viewpoint. Can you perhaps highlight some of the underlying demand vectors for a business that\u2019s been historically lumpy in nature, perhaps, the durability of this level growth looking forward and perhaps progress on reaching customers beyond Cray\u2019s historically public sector customer base? Thanks.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s part of the thesis why we combined Cray with the organic portfolio HPE had. You need to look at the segmentation of the business. Obviously, Cray plays on the top end of the supercomputer market with a unique set of technologies both in software and silicon. That\u2019s very important to understand. Cray brought to us a fully verticalized stack from the silicon, particularly in the interconnect fabric to the entire software to manage these very specialized workloads which is a significant point of differentiation for us. And then the HPE Apollo, which is a platform I actually introduced when I was running the Compute business in 2013, plays more in the mid-range and the low end in a density optimized and other types of workloads. The combination drives tremendous synergies across the entire segment and it\u2019s true it is lumpy. No question about it. But it\u2019s lumpy because the way the mechanics works in term of revenue recognition. So in this business, obviously, you take the order, then you have the time to build it. It takes some times months to build one of the systems. You have to ship it, you have to install it, you have to run the workload and only when the customer give us acceptance we can recognize revenue. But remember, what we showed at SAM is the fact that we have more than $2 billion in backlog, meaning awarded business that we expect to ship between \u201821 and \u201822, and that business is already won, okay? And some of those include exascale systems, which obviously, we shared the data with you, which we won five out of six. But since SAM, we won new deals and I quoted some of those in my opening remarks, like the Pawsey deal and the European Union deal and these are typical. And the reason why we win is because we have a very set of specialized technology. And the need to collocate data in Compute is unique. And that\u2019s why not only we continue to grow the business at the pace you saw, but also we own 39 of the Top 500 supercomputers and we own 37% of the share. So we are very pleased with this business. Our thesis is coming through and the reason is because of data. Data is exploding, AI is now a democratized tool in many ways. You need high-performance computing capabilities to run it. By the way, we see now the momentum on margins too, right, because now we own more of that stack.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks, Irvin. Appreciate the question and Operator, next one please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I was wondering, Antonio, if you can talk a bit about your thoughts behind the headquarters move and any potential cost savings not from layoffs, but perhaps lower taxes in that? And then, I don\u2019t know, Tarek, if you can just confirm that the cost of the new building was included within your free cash flow estimates? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. Listen, as we look into the future, our business needs opportunities for cost savings, simplifying our footprint. And also remember we learned quite a bit, Shannon, about the team preferences about the future to work. Altogether, we made the decision to relocate the headquarters. Let me be clear, our technological hub for innovation, particularly in Aruba, Software and Storage is in Silicon Valley. And basically what we are doing is consolidating our Silicon Valley footprint in the state of our San Jose headquarters that we opened last year. This is our technological hub. Now, for non-technical hub and as jobs, we decided to move the headquarters to Texas, because you have access to diverse talent and ability to attract and retain is unique and differentiated. So, what we are creating here is two very strong hubs with clear mandates on each of them. From the taxes perspective, there is none, because we are incorporated in Delaware to begin with. Definitely our savings associated with the real estate because you rationalize the Bay Area footprint, you expect savings. The cost of that new site in Houston was already included in our numbers because we already were building that since 2000 -- beginning of 2020. That was already in the plan. We are not changing anything. So, we are just relocating that. And what we are doing for the unique job functions that we believe are better suited to be in Houston, we are offering the voluntary move to the employees and there will be no jobs impact in California. So that\u2019s pretty much it and we are creating again two very strong hubs for our company, and rationalize the footprint that will drive cost savings over time, which by the way they are part of project accelerate as we go along.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thank you, Shannon. And Operator, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: Thanks. Good afternoon. What have you seen in Europe as markets have -- as some of those markets have shutdown and do you view that as a path to what you might see in the U.S. over the next few months? And then just as it relates to demand in the October quarter, any difference in trends between the commercial enterprise and public sector?\nAntonio Neri: Yeah. Katy, I mean, Europe was strong for us. I mean, honestly, the lockdown is happening as we speak maybe in the last two weeks to three weeks in some markets. But I have to say, no real impact at this point in time that we can see. We again exit October with the momentum and a good order book getting to Q1. The momentum is being cut in November. But again there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty out there. I am not sure yet what real impact it is. I also will say that customers are now kind of accustomed to deal with this way to work, obviously, we have been now nine months, 10 months in this situation and so business continues. There may be -- certain things may be slowed down over time because you need to access the certain facilities. But overall, I haven\u2019t seen anything in particular right now. Commercial seems to be improving. And then, on the public sector side, obviously, we participate particular with HPC and that continue to be very, very strong, I will say.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks, Katy. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJeriel Ong: Thank you so much for squeezing me in. Revenues, it\u2019s nice to see this revenue trend kind of get back to that flat year-on-year range? But if I really look at the gross and operating margins, there are still deltas on a year-on-year basis. I understand the normalization of backlog may have something to do with the modeling of this? But I guess going forward as you -- with your forecasting of fiscal \u201821, what are the prospects for margin normalization back into those fiscal \u201819 figures? Thanks.\nTarek Robbiati: Hi, Jeriel. Thanks for the question. So, if you refer back to our outlook on revenue that we provided at SAM and that was a 1% to 3% CAGR growth of revenue that we reiterated today as we issued our guidance for fiscal year \u201821. We also said that we expect operating profit to grow 15% to 20% over next year. And so when you take the combination of the revenue growth, which is outpaced by the operating profit growth, yeah, surely there will be operating margin expansion. And what\u2019s fueling that expansion is the cost optimization and prioritization program, which is well on track and most of the benefits of that program will be attained towards the end of fiscal year \u201821. And I want to remind everybody that we are foreseeing $800 million of net run rate savings of the fiscal year \u201819 baseline and so you can infer from this where the margins would be by the end of fiscal year \u201821 leading into fiscal year \u201822.\nAndrew Simanek: Perfect. Thanks, Jeriel. Operator, I think, we have got time for just one last question, please.\nOperator: And that question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRod Hall: Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to come back to the Financial Services business and particularly the write-off percentage and the increase there. I know there\u2019s a little bit of seasonality there, Tarek, but it seems like that\u2019s up a little bit. I am just curious if you could say a word about. I know you have said it\u2019s a healthy absolute level, but a word about what it tells us about the end market and whether you would expect that to decline in the January quarter? And then, I assume the return on equity there is still relatively low, because you guys are forgiving payments. But could you just update us on that payment forgiveness plan and is that over, are you still doing it, just kind of give us an update on where that stands as well? Thanks.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you, Rod. It\u2019s a really good question. So when you look at the Financial Services business, the bad debt loss ratio is just over 1%. It\u2019s up modestly. I am very comfortable personally with that level, given what happened in the pandemic and we are absolutely satisfied with the way the business unit has performed. The team has worked incredibly hard to give payment holidays to certain customers who needed it. This is why year-over-year you see the revenue dropping, but the profitability hasn\u2019t dropped dramatically at all and that is testing of the way the management team has performed this year. And it\u2019s actually what that translates into is an extremely strong position for the future, because what happened is that you had contract extended as a result of those payment holidays quote-unquote and when those contracts extend that over time leads to higher returns as you know in the leasing space. So, on the whole I feel very positive about the performance of HPEFS. I want to reiterate cash collections, have already returned to pre-COVID levels, which is good, economically, it\u2019s a sound position also for the economy. We are now collecting cash on deferrals granted earlier in the year and that level of deferral was granted to a small subset of the customers, and we do expect the return on equity to trend back to the 15% plus levels over the next couple of years.\nAntonio Neri: All right. Thanks, Tarek.\nRod Hall: Okay.\nAntonio Neri: I know there may be some more questions, Andy, but I know you and Tarek will do some call backs as well and so there will be opportunity for those who were not able to put a question into answer the question. In any case, I just want to finish by saying that Q4 was marked by a very strong rebound in our total company revenue. We are pleased with the results. While much uncertainty still exists in the overall market. I am confident in our team\u2019s ability to execute the strategic priorities we shared with you, particularly SAM, which we believe will position us to drive future sustainable profitable growth. And again thank you for joining the call today -- joining us today on the call and I hope you continue to stay safe and healthy. Happy holidays to you and your families.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call today. Thank you and at this time you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished the year with a very strong performance. In Q4 we saw a notable rebound in our overall revenue with particular acceleration in key growth areas of our business. Tarek? So I just want to emphasize a couple of points that I hope that, I think got lost through Tarek's commentary here, because he provided a lot of insight. Our orders in Compute without China, because as you know we have a difference, it was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, our new orders. And then as we think about the total server category, which is Compute plus HPC plus MCS, you combine all of that and basically when you normalize for the backlog, we would have been up quite a bit sequentially and up low-single digits year-over-year and that's why we believe we have gained share in total server revenue. Yeah. Thank you for the question. I mean, we committed to doubling down on the Edge two years ago, where I went on to state that the Intelligent Edge is the next big frontier. And when you think about digital transformation, all starts with a connectivity. And in order to participate in the digital transformation, you need connectivity, you need security and then ultimately you need to bring the cloud computing, where the data is created and we have now seen that the vast majority of the data is created outside the data center, outside the big cloud and more and more where we live and work. Obviously, the pandemic has validated what I said two years ago that the enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And when I think about our Q4 performance and I am going to speak organically, because the Silver Peak acquisition was just four weeks, five weeks in our numbers. We grew year-over-year versus our competitors in the traditional space whether its Cisco,  orders declined and that's why we believe we are going to gain share. And the reason why we believe the momentum will continue is not just because of the transformation that we see in customers, particularly as we are going to be in a much more distributed enterprise where connectivity has to be ubiquitous, it's because we have a cloud native solution. It is important that the street understands our Aruba Edge Services platform is a software company and provides cloud connectivity from the cloud with security, analytics, AI and all the things that you need in this environment at massive scale and it has been designed for devices, people and things. And that's why we have in that platform today more than 65,000 customers and we are adding 14,000 new devices every single day and that momentum is all about the experience we can provide and this is why we saw the 14% growth sequentially and also we saw the 5% year-over-year growth. But what is interesting is it is a software-as-a-service growth because ultimately that contributes to our ARR. And by the way, our switching was up sequentially high-single digits versus our competitor down and our wireless LAN was up 20% quarter-over-quarter. So, we believe we have something special and unique here right at the middle where the customer demand is. I don't know, Tarek, if you want to add any commentary. And I think you should walk away with three key trends, so that you can put that in context. One is, Wi-Fi for secured remote worker solutions. Wi-Fi 6 refresh, which is a pull-through for switching because of the architecture and obviously the acceleration as for SD-WAN, which obviously Silver Peak plays a huge role. And last but not least, we see an increased demand in NaaS, which is network-as-a-service, which obviously is a component of our HPE GreenLake offering. Yeah. Thanks, Wamsi. I mean I will say we are very encouraged by the all the momentum we have. Obviously, there's still quite a bit of uncertainty out there. We are still subscribed to our thesis that Tarek and I discussed in Q2 which is a U shaped recovery. But what I am really pleased is that order momentum and the sequential growth that we continue to see, and the demand particularly in the growth areas, but also very pleased with what is pointed to the stabilization of the core business. The fact that our Compute orders grew sequentially 2% is very, very good. We also saw a sequential growth in Storage in orders and I think it's pointed to different solutions, Wamsi. Obviously, we see in our containers, we see bare metal applications, we see everything that's workload optimized, data recovery is one aspect of it, VDI is another aspect of it. I think there is a shift in not just buying infrastructure, but that type of infrastructure which is way more optimized. And one of the things we see obviously is GreenLake. GreenLake is a driving force for pulling through our portfolio and when you pull that portfolio through, Compute and Storage win and that's where we discussed at SAM, not only we need to focus on the stabilization, but the transformation of that business to become more software and silicon-oriented, which the example of that is we introduced our Silicon Root of Trust Version 2.0, which is the most secure platform on the planet. But what is interesting, if you listen to some of our competitors, including today, they say that 96% of the spend is still on-prem. This is not my words. It's a big cloud provider who said that. And that transition is an important transition for us to capture and that's where we went ahead with our on-premise solutions as-a-service. So that's where I think there is definitely stabilization in demand. There is increased demand in certain areas associated with connectivity, AI, data. We see more workload optimized solution. We see more IT resiliency needed at this point in time and that's where, as we enter Q1, we enter with a very strong momentum on orders and that's where we were confident with Tarek to raise our guidance for the year. Oracle? Correct. Thanks, Wamsi. Yeah. Well, that's part of the thesis why we combined Cray with the organic portfolio HPE had. You need to look at the segmentation of the business. Obviously, Cray plays on the top end of the supercomputer market with a unique set of technologies both in software and silicon. That's very important to understand. Cray brought to us a fully verticalized stack from the silicon, particularly in the interconnect fabric to the entire software to manage these very specialized workloads which is a significant point of differentiation for us. And then the HPE Apollo, which is a platform I actually introduced when I was running the Compute business in 2013, plays more in the mid-range and the low end in a density optimized and other types of workloads. The combination drives tremendous synergies across the entire segment and it's true it is lumpy. No question about it. But it's lumpy because the way the mechanics works in term of revenue recognition. So in this business, obviously, you take the order, then you have the time to build it. It takes some times months to build one of the systems. You have to ship it, you have to install it, you have to run the workload and only when the customer give us acceptance we can recognize revenue. But remember, what we showed at SAM is the fact that we have more than $2 billion in backlog, meaning awarded business that we expect to ship between \u201821 and \u201822, and that business is already won, okay? And some of those include exascale systems, which obviously, we shared the data with you, which we won five out of six. But since SAM, we won new deals and I quoted some of those in my opening remarks, like the Pawsey deal and the European Union deal and these are typical. And the reason why we win is because we have a very set of specialized technology. And the need to collocate data in Compute is unique. And that's why not only we continue to grow the business at the pace you saw, but also we own 39 of the Top 500 supercomputers and we own 37% of the share. So we are very pleased with this business. Our thesis is coming through and the reason is because of data. Data is exploding, AI is now a democratized tool in many ways. You need high-performance computing capabilities to run it. By the way, we see now the momentum on margins too, right, because now we own more of that stack. Sure. Listen, as we look into the future, our business needs opportunities for cost savings, simplifying our footprint. And also remember we learned quite a bit, Shannon, about the team preferences about the future to work. Altogether, we made the decision to relocate the headquarters. Let me be clear, our technological hub for innovation, particularly in Aruba, Software and Storage is in Silicon Valley. And basically what we are doing is consolidating our Silicon Valley footprint in the state of our San Jose headquarters that we opened last year. This is our technological hub. Now, for non-technical hub and as jobs, we decided to move the headquarters to Texas, because you have access to diverse talent and ability to attract and retain is unique and differentiated. So, what we are creating here is two very strong hubs with clear mandates on each of them. From the taxes perspective, there is none, because we are incorporated in Delaware to begin with. Definitely our savings associated with the real estate because you rationalize the Bay Area footprint, you expect savings. The cost of that new site in Houston was already included in our numbers because we already were building that since 2000 -- beginning of 2020. That was already in the plan. We are not changing anything. So, we are just relocating that. And what we are doing for the unique job functions that we believe are better suited to be in Houston, we are offering the voluntary move to the employees and there will be no jobs impact in California. So that's pretty much it and we are creating again two very strong hubs for our company, and rationalize the footprint that will drive cost savings over time, which by the way they are part of project accelerate as we go along. Yeah. Katy, I mean, Europe was strong for us. I mean, honestly, the lockdown is happening as we speak maybe in the last two weeks to three weeks in some markets. But I have to say, no real impact at this point in time that we can see. We again exit October with the momentum and a good order book getting to Q1. The momentum is being cut in November. But again there's still a lot of uncertainty out there. I am not sure yet what real impact it is. I also will say that customers are now kind of accustomed to deal with this way to work, obviously, we have been now nine months, 10 months in this situation and so business continues. There may be -- certain things may be slowed down over time because you need to access the certain facilities. But overall, I haven't seen anything in particular right now. Commercial seems to be improving. And then, on the public sector side, obviously, we participate particular with HPC and that continue to be very, very strong, I will say. All right. Thanks, Tarek. I know there may be some more questions, Andy, but I know you and Tarek will do some call backs as well and so there will be opportunity for those who were not able to put a question into answer the question. In any case, I just want to finish by saying that Q4 was marked by a very strong rebound in our total company revenue. We are pleased with the results. While much uncertainty still exists in the overall market. I am confident in our team's ability to execute the strategic priorities we shared with you, particularly SAM, which we believe will position us to drive future sustainable profitable growth. And again thank you for joining the call today -- joining us today on the call and I hope you continue to stay safe and healthy. Happy holidays to you and your families."

            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. I will start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I will be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on slide four, so now let me discuss our financial performance starting with slide five. I am very pleased to report that Q4 marked a return of revenue to pre-pandemic levels. We delivered Q4 revenues of $7.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and flat from a prior year period as our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC & MCS executed strongly. We also cleared our backlog by further $250 million during the quarter, which has now returned to normalize levels as we exited Q4. As a result of the improved revenue performance, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 7% sequentially to $2.2 billion in Q4. Non GAAP gross margins of 30.6% were also up sequentially driven by positive mix shift towards Intelligent Edge, Storage and HPC/MCS, all of which reported strong sequential revenue growth. Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 15% sequentially, resulting in a 7.7% operating margin and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.37, was up 16% sequentially. Q4 cash flow from operations was $747 million, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $223 million and that was in line with our guidance, as we saw the expected reversal in the favorable working capital movements from elevated backlog in Q3. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q1 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in January 2021. Now, let's turn to our segment highlights in slides six and seven. As you can see, we are doing exactly what we said we would do at SAM in October. We are doubling down on our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC/MCS, while stabilizing our core business segments of Compute and Storage. In Intelligent Edge, we continued our momentum with 14% quarter-over-quarter and 5% year-over-year growth. We also expect to take share in both campus switching and wireless LAN with our best-in-class portfolio, which was just recognized as a leader for the 15th year in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless LAN access infrastructure. We are also beginning to see the operating profit potential of this business, with operating margin in Q4 of 10.1%, up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 390 basis points year-over-year as we drove greater productivity from prior investments in this business. Finally, we closed the Silver Peak acquisition on September 21st, so it had a minimal contribution in Q4, but obviously Silver Peak will be more meaningful going forward. In HPC & MCS, revenue reached record levels near $1 billion, growing 50% sequentially and 25% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in Cray, HPC Apollo and MCS. We executed well against our existing order book with increased customer acceptances and grew orders further with a healthy pipeline. As you know, this business can be lumpy with revenue recognition and profitability linked to completion of critical customer milestones. While we do expect to see a normal seasonal decline in Q1 \u201821, we are well on our way to delivering our 8% to 12% three-year revenue CAGR outlined at SAM. In Compute, revenue declined 7% sequentially, but was up low-single digits when normalizing Q3 and Q4 results for backlog conversion. Gross and operating margins were also pressured by clearing the backlog as we had to fulfill orders at cost levels higher than originally quoted. We are pleased to report that backlog has now returned to normalized levels. Thanks to continued improvements in our supply chain execution. Within Storage, we grew revenue 7% quarter-over-quarter driven by strong operational execution, reduced backlog and improved order momentum in key areas of the portfolio. We saw notable strength in big data, up 27% sequentially driven by increased customer focus on AI machine learning related applications, all-flash array storage up 19% sequentially by increase -- driven by increased adoption of Primera all-flash and dHCI, which grew double digits sequentially. We also expanded operating margins this quarter, which was up 380 basis points quarter-on-quarter ending at 16.7% of revenue and already aligned to our SAM fiscal year \u201823 targets. With respect to Pointnext Operational Services, which is included across our Compute, HPC/MCS and Storage segments, total revenue was up 2%, while orders were down 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware units sold continued to be strong with notable strength in Compute and Storage, excluding Nimble, which were up low-single digits growth on a sequential basis. In Advisory and Professional Services, revenue was up 6% sequentially, even as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 6% and revenue was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, despite the impact of COVID-19. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 1.06%, which while slightly higher than previous quarters is still best-in-class and well within our comfort zone, as cash collections have already returned back to pre-COVID levels. In our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investments segment, orders were up 18% and revenue was up 6% sequentially, driven by strong double-digit orders and revenue growth in Americas. Additionally, due to our improved cost of delivery, we were able to expand operating margins by 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco network functions. Slide eight shows key metrics of our growing as-a-service business, which I elaborated on during our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. We are making great strides in our AAS offering. I am pleased to report that our Q4 \u201820 ARR came in at $585 million, representing 11% quarter-over-quarter and 30% year-over-year reported growth. Total as-a-service orders were up 20% year-over-year, driven by outstanding performance in North America and APJ. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform also continued to grow revenues strong double digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is delivering and progressing towards its ARR growth targets of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year \u201820 fiscal year \u201823, set at our 2019 SAM and reiterated at our 2020 SAM meeting. Slide nine highlights our revenue and EPS performance to-date, where you can clearly see Q2 was a trough. Strong operational execution has driven sequential revenue growth from a low of $6 billion in Q2 all the way back to $7.2 billion in Q4. Turning to slide 10, the rebound in revenue has resulted in a 15% improvement in non-GAAP gross profit from the Q2 trough, which was up to $2.2 billion in Q4. Also, the gross margin rate in Q4 of 30.6% of revenues was up 20 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of Intelligent Edge, Storage and HPC/MCS, which are higher margin businesses, offset by continued execution of elevated Compute backlog, which was a headwind but is now behind us. Moving to slide 11, you can see how the improvement in gross profit combined with progress on our cost optimization plan has delivered 53% growth in operating profit from the Q2 trough, while still investing for growth. As mentioned at SAM, we are making excellent progress in our cost optimization and prioritization plan, which will strengthen our financial foundation, while aligning resources to critical growth areas. As of the end of this quarter, we are on track to deliver annualized net run rate savings for at least $800 million from the FY \u201819 baseline by the end of fiscal year \u201822, with most of the savings being realized by the end of fiscal year \u201821. Obviously, we will keep you updated on our progress in the upcoming quarters. Turning to slide 12, we generated cash flow from operations of $747 million and free cash flow was $223 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements from clearing backlog that resulted in favorability in Q3, but a headwind we flagged for in Q4. We ended fiscal year \u201820 with free cash flow of $560 million in line with our outlook provided at SAM 2020. Looking to \u201821, we expect free cash flow to grow over 75% at the midpoint of our outlook of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Please remember our normal cash flow seasonality where the second half is a stronger generator of cash flow than the first half. Now moving on to slide 13, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position, which is a competitive advantage in the current environment. As our October 31st quarter end, we had approximately $4.2 billion of cash after successfully redeeming $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020 and paying approximately $853 million net of cash, excuse me, $853 of net cash for closing the Silver Peak transaction. Together, with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $9 billion of liquidity. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating, which was recently reaffirmed by the rating agencies. Bottomline, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operation, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy. Now turning to outlook on slide 14, at our recent Securities Analyst Meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year \u201821 and I would encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. Having said that, let me drill down on a few key areas. We continue to expect to grow our fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP operating profit by 15% to 20% and now expect FY \u201821 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $1.60 to $1.78, as a result of increased confidence in margin improvement. This is a $0.03 per share improvement on the midpoint of our prior guidance of a $1.56 to $1.76 in EPS. From a topline perspective, we are pleased with the rebound we saw in Q4 and continue to see gradual improvement, but want to remain somewhat cautious due to the uncertain pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically for Q1 \u201821, after normalizing for excess backlog reduction in Q4 \u201820 of $250 million, we expect Q1 \u201821 revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q4. For fiscal year \u201821, we expect total revenue to be in line with our long-term financial targets of a CAGR of 1% to 3% presented in our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. For Q1 \u201821, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.02 to $0.06 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.40 to $0.44. So overall, I am very pleased with the performance in the quarter and execution against our strategy and financial priorities outlined at SAM. We have navigated well through unprecedented challenges this fiscal year and had a very strong finish. Q4 was marked by a strong rebound in revenue as we reduced backlog to normalized levels and saw increased order momentum across all business segments. We saw significant acceleration and customer demand in our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC/MCS. Our core business of Compute and Storage is pointing to signs of stabilization and our as-a-service ARR continues to show strong momentum aligned to our outlook. We have been proactive in strengthening our financial foundation and aligning resources to critical areas to transform our core. This will ultimately drive sustainable profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long run. Let me close by reiterating that I am very proud of what we have accomplished as a team during very challenging and uncertain times, and we look forward to fiscal year \u201821. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you. All right. So, look, if you look at total revenue in Compute, as Antonio said, and I think, I reiterated too, revenue was up low-single digits when you normalize for Q3 and Q4 for backlog conversion, right? So, considering where we were at the end of Q2, the team did an outstanding job of driving supply chain efficiencies and clearing that backlog. The backlog is no more a problem. It's back to normalized levels. Specifically, with respect to order trends and momentum, order trends were encouraging and then this is pointing to further stabilization in this business. And most importantly, if you look on a combined view for servers across Compute and HPC/MCS, which is how the market tracks server's performance, our total net revenue in the servers would be up low-single digits sequentially and up low-double digits sequentially, if you exclude the impact of backlog in Q3 and Q4. So we feel we gained revenue market share in total servers for the second consecutive quarter. Now when you look at margins in that context, gross and operating margins were pressurized by clearing backlog as we had to fulfill orders in Q4 at cost levels higher than they were originally quoted. Having said that, we are pleased to report now again that the backlog has returned to normalized levels and we continue to improve our supply chain execution. As we continue to stabilize this business, we expect gross margins to expand now that backlog is no longer an issue and mix shift to more profitable market segments. We also continue to optimize R&D and sales investments, and expect to achieve an operating profit margin of 10% to 12%. This is what we told you as part of our long-term outlook provided at SAM. That's absolutely right, Antonio. There's one thing I can add from a financial standpoint is, we do project that the edge is going to outgrow the market, given the strong differentiation that the Aruba Edge Services platform provides as Antonio described and we see revenue growing at a 6% to 10% CAGR over the next three years from FY \u201820 to FY \u201823 and this will come with enhanced profitability. We ended Q4 with a 10.1% op margin, up 150 basis points. Longer term, we expect operating margins to progress upwards, through the teens with more scale and richer gross margins from higher software content such as the Aruba Services platform including the contribution from Silver Peak. Wamsi, so the question on Oracle. So, yes, we have not forgotten about that one, of course. Let me remind everybody where we stand. There was a $3 billion roughly jury verdict in HPE's favor in the Itanium matter. That matter remains on appeal. The renewed judgment now stands at $3.8 billion in total with interest accruing at 10% since May 2019, so an interesting interest rate here. The appeal has been fully briefed and we are awaiting the California Court of Appeal to schedule oral arguments. Although, we are hopeful that we will receive a ruling from the California Court of Appeal in 2021, obviously the timing of this is out of our control. We remain confident that the outcome on appeal will be favorable to HPE and also I want to remind you all that we would have to share any sort of payment with our cousins at HP Inc. Hi, Jeriel. Thanks for the question. So, if you refer back to our outlook on revenue that we provided at SAM and that was a 1% to 3% CAGR growth of revenue that we reiterated today as we issued our guidance for fiscal year \u201821. We also said that we expect operating profit to grow 15% to 20% over next year. And so when you take the combination of the revenue growth, which is outpaced by the operating profit growth, yeah, surely there will be operating margin expansion. And what's fueling that expansion is the cost optimization and prioritization program, which is well on track and most of the benefits of that program will be attained towards the end of fiscal year \u201821. And I want to remind everybody that we are foreseeing $800 million of net run rate savings of the fiscal year \u201819 baseline and so you can infer from this where the margins would be by the end of fiscal year \u201821 leading into fiscal year \u201822. Thank you, Rod. It's a really good question. So when you look at the Financial Services business, the bad debt loss ratio is just over 1%. It's up modestly. I am very comfortable personally with that level, given what happened in the pandemic and we are absolutely satisfied with the way the business unit has performed. The team has worked incredibly hard to give payment holidays to certain customers who needed it. This is why year-over-year you see the revenue dropping, but the profitability hasn't dropped dramatically at all and that is testing of the way the management team has performed this year. And it's actually what that translates into is an extremely strong position for the future, because what happened is that you had contract extended as a result of those payment holidays quote-unquote and when those contracts extend that over time leads to higher returns as you know in the leasing space. So, on the whole I feel very positive about the performance of HPEFS. I want to reiterate cash collections, have already returned to pre-COVID levels, which is good, economically, it's a sound position also for the economy. We are now collecting cash on deferrals granted earlier in the year and that level of deferral was granted to a small subset of the customers, and we do expect the return on equity to trend back to the 15% plus levels over the next couple of years."

With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\nAntonio Neri: Thanks, Sonalee, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Overall, I am pleased with our Q3 performance. We executed well to enable strong sequential growth across our businesses. We gained momentum in key areas of differentiation, driven by customer demand aligned to our strategy, and we began to take decisive and prudent actions to strengthen our core financial foundation, while we continue to align resources to critical areas of growth. COVID-19 has forced fundamental changes in businesses and communities. These changes have further validated our strategy. Navigating through the pandemic and planning for a post-COVID world has increased customer needs for other service offerings, secure connectivity, remote work capabilities and analytics to unlock insights from data. Our solutions are aligned to these needs, and we see a tremendous opportunity to help our customers transform and digitize their businesses as they continue to adapt and operate in our new world. Let me review a few highlights from the quarter. Total net revenue of $6.8 billion was up 14% quarter-over-quarter and non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. Compute, HPC & MCS, Storage, and Intelligent Edge business segments also grew sequentially. Moving forward, we expect continued gradual performance improvement. We made significant improvements in our supply chain execution, reducing our backlog by more than $500 million from our Q2 historical high exit levels, which contributed to our results. In our HPC business, COVID-related impacts continued to affect our customers' ability to accept delivery of our products. We expect to return to normalized level of backlog by the end of Q4 through continued improvements in both supply chain execution and customer acceptances. Our pivot to as-a-service continued its strong momentum in the quarter. Our annualized revenue run rate of $528 million grew 11% year-over-year. GreenLake services orders grew a record 82% year-over-year. We believe this is faster than the orders growth of public cloud vendors and it is a validation of our hyper strategy and competitive differentiation. We are focused on delivering one seamless cloud experience for all applications and data, no matter where they exist; at the edge, in a data center, in a colocation, or in a public cloud estate. While others are public now publicly declaring plans to offer Everything-as-a-Service, we have been focused on this for several years and have made significant organic and inorganic investments to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers. Our Q3 free cash flow of $924 million was up $276 million year-over-year, driven by a record cash flow from operations as a result of our improved execution this quarter. Importantly, we also declared our Q4 dividend today. Dividends remain an important part of our capital allocation framework that consists of capital return to shareholders and strategic investments that together drive long-term shareholder value. Our customers are managing through the pandemic with even greater needs for the capabilities HP can uniquely provide. In June, we put our strategy in the spotlight at our Discover Virtual Experience event, where we introduced new breakthrough innovation on a global virtual stage. The new solutions we introduced support our position that cloud is an experience, not a destination, and they're already gaining traction with our customers. We launched our next-generation of HP GreenLake Cloud Services. These new cloud services span machine learning operations, container management, virtualization, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, data protection and Connectivity-as-a-Service. Now, our customers can access all of our HP GreenLake Cloud services via a soft service point-and-click catalog on our HP GreenLake Central Cloud Portal. Notably, in Q3, we signed several of our largest HPE GreenLake Cloud services deals in history, including LyondellBasell, one of the largest plastics, chemicals, and refining companies in the world who signed a $27 million HP GreenLake deal to drive their digital transformation and environmental efficiency. Underpinning our customers' cloud experience is the need for software. That is why we introduce our new HPE Ezmeral software portfolio. Our new portfolio includes a container platform that deploys Kubernetes at scale for a wide range of use cases on bare-metal and virtual machines. A data fabric that delivers enterprise-wide global access to data from edge-to-cloud with best-in-class reliability, security and performance, and machine learning operations solution that increases speed and agility for machine learning ops by operationalizing end-to-end processes from pilot to production, as well as IT operations and automation to improve productivity and mitigate risk of service disruption. In addition, it enables our customer to control cost and compliance across their hybrid cloud estate through our managed cloud controls capabilities built into the portfolio. HPE Ezmeral can be consumed as a license or as a part of our HPE GreenLake Cloud Services offering. And just a few weeks ago, as a strong endorsement of our strategy and capabilities, we announced plans to partner with SAP to deliver the customer addition of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake Cloud Services. This new joint solution will help customers leverage our cloud capabilities, while keeping their SAP workloads and data on-premises. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our core capabilities in Storage and Compute, which are essential resources to store and process customers' data. Every 60 seconds, we ship 46 terabytes of storage in four servers. Despite the challenging market that impacted our storage performance overall, in Q3, we saw sequential improvement of 4%, and importantly, we gained traction and grew in key areas of investment. Big Data storage, which is built on unique intellectual property from our MapR acquisition to enable real-time analytics for mission critical Big Data overloads, grew revenues 31% year-over-year. Nimble distributed HCI, our new hyper-converged solution for business-critical applications and mixed overloads of scale grew revenue at 112% year-over-year. And a great example of our organic innovation is HP Primera, our most intelligent storage platform, grew revenues 114% year-over-year. HP Primera gained 104 new logos this quarter, with nearly one-quarter of those being new to HP Storage. We saw strong sequential momentum with HPC in mission-critical systems that grew 10%, including a 10-year deal of $125 million with the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who chose HPE to power the Edinburgh International Data Facility with our industry-leading HPC and AI solutions. And finally, we had a very solid quarter in Compute, with 29% quarter-over-quarter growth, driven by the reduction in backlog and customer demand in VDI, or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure solutions. For example, Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands wanted to upgrade its VDI environment for life cycle management needs and to prepare for future waves of COVID-19. We introduced a complete composable hyper-converged infrastructure solution based on HPE Synergy, along with HPE Primera to meet their needs. Our Intelligent Edge business performed in line with the market in Q3. We continue to see the edge as a significant opportunity over the long-term. The explosion of data devices and application will drive demand for secure multi-protocol connectivity, analytics and cloud computing capabilities at the Edge, especially in the post-COVID world. We are now entering the edge of insights, driven by the amount of data we are generating and the utilization of new analytic tools, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. Customers are looking to power a new breed of applications and workloads that work in concert with the cloud, but analyze and process data at the edge. To enable these new customer needs, we introduced the Aruba Edge services platform, or Aruba ESP, the industry first AI-powered cloud platform designed for to unify, automate and secure the edge. The Aruba ESP combines AIOps, Aruba Zero Trust security and a unified infrastructure with financial and consumption flexibility. And we are seeing early customer adoption. Noble Hospitality, a luxury lifestyle brand is standardizing on our Aruba Edge services platform as their edge cloud foundation for the hotel chain. The ability to generate actionable analytics where the data is created and deliver new on-property experiences for guests was critical to their decision. We also announced our plans to acquire SD-WAN leader Silver Peak. Silver Peak's advanced SD-WAN offerings strengthened our Aruba ESP and complements Aruba's existing work-from-home and branch office solutions to deliver one of the industry's most comprehensive portfolios designed to securely connect any edge to any cloud. The combination, which is expected to close in Q4 of this fiscal year, will allow enterprise customers to simplify their branch office and one deployments to empower remote workforces, enable cloud-native deployments and transform business operations without compromising quality or reliability. These are great example of accelerating our strategy while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Building on our 5G Core Stack launched in March, we introduced a new Telco Edge Orchestrator Solution for telecom operators. This new solution provides revenue opportunities for telecoms in the enterprise market with one-click deployment of applications at the edge of the new 5G networks. We are receiving positive feedback on our 5G offerings. For example, we announced an innovative technical demonstration of an automated virtual 5G network conducted with a French telecom operator, Orange, and telco infrastructure solutions provider Casa systems. The demo highlights the expanding use cases and service agility needed to support 5G business applications, including location-based telemetry, IoT, edge computing and more that will require low latency. Our ability to innovate for our customers is made possible by strong financial management that strengthen our core financial foundation and allows us to align resources to the most critical areas. As we exited Q2, you will recall that we took a number of decisive and prudent actions to manage our business through the evolving impacts of COVID-19. This included several short-term initiatives to reduce operating expenses and drive efficiencies as well as the introduction of a long-term cost optimization and prioritization plan designed to accelerate sustainable profitable growth. We remain on track to deliver the annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year 2022, driven by optimizing our workplace site strategy, simplifying our product portfolio and introducing new digital customer engagement models. These efforts, backed by our diversified portfolio, robust balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, will allow us to continue to invest in key growth areas. In closing, I am proud of our Q3 performance, and I am proud of our HPE team. Our team members have been steadfast partners for our customers through an unprecedented period. They have moved quickly to address rapidly evolving market conditions. They have innovated with our customers in mind. They have made personal sacrifices to invest in our company's future. They have passionately committed to help HPE play a role in shaping a more equitable and inclusive society. And they have done all of this, while managing the challenges of living through a global pandemic. Put it more simply, my HP colleagues have represented our values, labor culture and deliver on our purpose to advance the way people even work. As a result of the efforts, HP is stronger and better able to serve our customers, partners and communities in a world that's forever changed. While we continue to navigate through the global pandemic and macro uncertainty, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see gradual quarter-over-quarter performance improvement going forward. This is why we are providing guidance for our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP EPS, which Tarek will discuss. We look forward to seeing you virtually at our security Analyst meeting on October 15, where we will provide more details about our long-term plans. And with that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, let me remind you that since the start of the fiscal year, we are reporting results according to our new segmentation. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on slide four. Now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with slide five. Q3 was characterized by strong execution, driving sequential growth. We delivered Q3 revenues of $6.8 billion, up 14% sequentially and down 4% from the prior year period. I am especially pleased to report that we have made significant progress in clearing our backlog by more than $500 million during the quarter. We expect a return to normalized backlog levels as we exit Q4 2020. As a result, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 8% sequentially to $2.1 billion in Q3. Non-GAAP gross margins were 30.4% this quarter, down 160 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of compute as we executed against our backlog from prior quarters. Normalizing for the effect of backlog, both our compute and storage business segments grew gross margin on a sequential basis. Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% sequentially, resulting in a 7.1% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 was up 45% sequentially. Our GAAP EPS was $0.01 as we accelerated our transformation program and incurred restructuring costs. Q3 cash flow from operations was approximately $1.5 billion, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million, up $276 million from the prior year period, driven primarily by favorable working capital movements that I will detail later. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable October 7, 2020. Let's move to slide six, which shows our performance in the quarter by segment. Here are the highlights. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew revenues 3% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the market. While wireless LAN declined single-digits sequentially, we grew the campus switching business 12% quarter-over-quarter. In North America, our largest geo, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating our continued momentum. Operating margin in Q3 was 8.6%, down 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter, impacted primarily by higher logistics and duties costs in this current environment. In Compute, revenue grew 29% quarter-over-quarter as we executed against the backlog and improved our supply chain execution. Not only did units grow strong double-digits sequentially, AUP grew 3% quarter-on-quarter as well. The increased operating leverage in this segment resulted in an operating profit margin of 8.5%, up 380 basis points quarter-over-quarter. In High Performance Compute & Mission Critical Systems, revenue grew 10% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong performance in Edge Compute, HPC Apollo, and MCS, up sequentially 82%, 16%, and 2%, respectively. We expect to see sequential momentum next quarter driven by increased customer acceptance for HPC/MCS and Cray as we execute against the order book across the portfolio. Most importantly, Cray remains on track to deliver both on its FY 2020 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by the end of fiscal year 2021. Within Storage, we grew revenue 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong operational execution across the segment portfolio of products and reduction of backlog to normalized levels. With respect to Pointnext operational services, which is included across our Compute, HPC/MCS, and Storage segments, total revenue was down 2%, while orders grew 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold continued to be strong with solid double-digit growth on a sequential basis across all segments; Compute, Storage and HPC/MCS. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust. In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was down 4% sequentially as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. This business is strategically important for us as it helps customers navigate through their digital transformation and also pull-through significant infrastructure and operational services orders. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 1% quarter-over-quarter despite the impact of COVID-19, and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter, driven primarily by FX movements. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 74 basis points, which was slightly higher than previous quarters is still best-in-class within this industry. I am particularly pleased by the collection performance in HPEFS, which attests to the quality of the book and the HPEFS franchise overall. I will come back to that later on. Our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investment segment is strategically important to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. Revenue was down 4% sequentially due to first half slowdown in services bookings. However, due to our improved cost of delivery, we're able to expand operating margins by 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud native telco networks functions. Slide 7 shows our growing ARR profile, which I introduced at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. I am very pleased to report that our Q3 2020 ARR came in at $528 million, representing 11% year-over-year growth. GreenLake Service orders were up 82% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by outstanding performance in North America, which delivered 5x year-over-year growth. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue strong double digits year-over-year as well. Based on strong customer demand, I am confident to reiterate our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2022. Slide 8 highlights our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.32 in Q3, up 45% sequentially from Q2 driven by improved operating leverage, cost control and lower OI&E expenses. We now expect fiscal year 2020 OI&E to be significantly less than our $100 million expense guidance provided at SAM 2019, driven by higher earnings from equity interest in HPC, and better cost of debt resulting from our balance sheet funding diversification strategy that I will elaborate further on. Turning to gross margin on slide 9. And as I mentioned previously, non-GAAP gross profit was up 8% sequentially due to improved operating leverage. At 30.4% of revenues, our gross margin was down 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter driven by higher mix of compute as we executed against our elevated backlog from the prior quarter. Most importantly, and normalizing for the effect of backlog, both Compute and Storage business segments grew gross margins on a sequential basis. Moving to slide 10. Non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1% in Q3 of fiscal year 2020 and non-GAAP operating income of $484 million was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. A combination of improved operating leverage and disciplined cost controls enabled us to improve profitability on a sequential basis. Last quarter, let me say this, we were prescient by proactively announcing the head of other industry players, a cost optimization and prioritization plan that would deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year 2022. We are making excellent progress there and are very much on track to emerge stronger in the post-COVID world. The actions we outlined as part of that plan to transform our core by optimizing our cost structure and aligning our resources through deep segmentation to key growth areas are now clearly starting to bear fruit. Turning to Slide 11. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $1.5 billion. This is the highest level for the past 11 quarters, as we improved our operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements that resulted in favorability in Q3. Overall, we saw an improvement in our cash conversion cycle for minus five days in the prior quarter to minus 10 days this quarter. For Q4, we expect free cash flow to be sequentially lower, mainly due to two reasons: number one, working capital will be a use of cash; and number two, higher restructuring payments related to our core transformation plan we announced in Q2. As you recall, during the lockdown, we discussed our company exposure by industry vertical and company size, and explain in detail that our business is highly resilient. As a proof point, I would like to highlight the performance of our credit collection teams in both our operating company and in HPEFS. Thanks to their contribution during the quarter, the level of our ARR that is current is at a record high of 99.5%, which attest of the strength of the HPE business and the quality of our franchise. Now moving on to Slide 12, I want to spend a moment to talk about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position and provide some insight on the puts and takes on forthcoming adjustments to our cash and debt positions. As of our 31st of July quarter end, we had approximately $8.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $1.75 billion in senior notes in July 2020 at a low-cost of debt. Post the quarter end, we redeemed $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $10.3 billion of liquidity after the redemption of the notes maturing in October 2020. Additionally, we expect to pay $925 million cash when we complete the proposed acquisition of Silver Peak, which is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal year 2020. Adjusted for these known changes, our opco gross debt would be lower by $3 billion to approximately $4.4 billion, and our opco cash will also be lower by $3.9 billion to approximately $4 billion, resulting in an opco net debt of approximately $400 million. Separately, we have securitized some Financial Services-related debt through the ABS market in the U.S., and as of July 301st quarter end, we have approximately $2.1 billion in outstanding ABS issuances. The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at cheaper cost of capital, which helps diversify our balance sheet and lower interest expense payments in the future. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in July 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy. Now turning to outlook on slide 13. Given the progress made in our operations, we are now in a position to provide guidance on fiscal year 2020 EPS. We expect to finish fiscal year 2020 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.34, and we expect our fiscal year 2020 GAAP diluted net loss per share to be between $0.35 and $0.31. Let me recap our key takeaways for this quarter on slide 14. We delivered strong sequential improvement in top and bottom line and significantly improved operational and supply chain execution. We also accelerated our as-a-service pivot with very strong momentum in ARR and record GreenLake Services order growth. We're taking actions to strengthen our financial foundation and align resources to critical areas to transform our core and drive sustainable profitable growth. At this stage, given all of this, we expect gradual sequential performance improvement moving forward. In Q3, we paid $154 million in dividends to shareholders. We recognized that dividends are an important part of our capital allocation framework and returns to shareholders. And today we are very pleased to declare a Q4 dividend of $0.12 per share payable on October 7, 2020. On a personal note, I\u2019d like to echo Antonio's comments. We are both very proud of the way our company and team members quickly and decisively responded to the unprecedented challenges that the global COVID-19 pandemic has caused. As Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us at our Virtual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15, where we will provide an update on our strategy, financial outlook and capital management policy. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: All right. Thank you, Tarek\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Antonio, can you talk a bit about what customers are telling you, maybe on a geographic basis or looking at your segments, about what they're looking to invest in? How they're feeling about IT budgets? Clearly, some of the other large-cap tech companies have come under pressure. So I'm curious as to sort of the sentiment that you're hearing from customers in the channel as they look to the next couple of quarters? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thank you, Shannon. So, I spent probably 50% of my time talking to customers and partners. So, I have a pretty good insight of what we see in the market. What we see right now, first of all, and I made this comment in my remarks, we see steady demand and obviously, there are areas which are stronger than others. But the general sense is as follows; first of all, they're looking to strengthen their operations, and therefore, IT plays a huge role with that, and IT resiliency is more important than ever. So, anything that comes with security and enables them to digitize their processes is on the growth side. Second is, obviously, they have a lot of data and they need to get insight from that data and we see an acceleration of solutions related to AI and machine learning, and that's why our big data storage saw another great solid performance. But obviously, MLOps, and that's why we introduced an offer with HP GreenLake Cloud Services around machine learning operations is a high demand. Obviously, as we look at the workforce and I think there are permanent and lasting changes to how we're going to work in the future, remote connectivity is essential. And that's why I'm so excited about the acquisition of Silver Peak, because together with Aruba services platform, give us now the ability to provide connectivity for all the edges and the edge now is your home office, right? I consider that the micro branch to any cloud. And obviously, there are multiple clouds, because it's a hybrid strategy. And then anything that preserves CapEx is also in high demand. And that's why we see significant momentum with our HP GreenLake Cloud services, because that's a true conceived as-a-service offering. And so obviously, that's in transition, right? We see -- what we see is a transition period. But I would say the enterprise has been steady. Obviously, SMBE is a challenge. From the customer segmentation perspective, is a challenge. When I look at the verticals, I think the financial sector where you play is still very sector where you play is still very solid and the manufacturing side as well. Education, obviously, now is going to be very important. And in the public sector, the public sector is very strong. And obviously, we have a unique portfolio there with our HPC and AI solutions, but also around Storage as well. So, that's the general theme, Shannon, that we see at this point in time. In terms of budgets, obviously, they are assessing what happens in the context of their own revenues and profit. But overall, I will say the enterprise, which is where we participate the most, is fairly steady. And that's why Tarek meant, we have a very diversified and resilient portfolio, both by customer segment and by solution.\nShannon Cross: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just looking at Compute, obviously, you had a benefit from the backlog. But underlying all of that, pricing, competition, component costs, I think you said that revenue was up even net of the backlog fulfillment. So, if you could just talk a bit about some of the underlying trends you're seeing there? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. The Compute business performed really well, 29% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. And we did a very good job in reducing the backlog. There's still some -- but that's why we feel very confident that we can totally get back to the historical levels by the end of Q4. We grew sequentially double digits in units, in AUP 3%. If you recall, commodity cost has been inflationary in the first part of the year, and we took quite significant actions on pricing. And that's why our AUPs went up because of pricing, but also because of the structural changes we continue to see in that type of products. I mentioned, we shipped 46 terabytes of storage. And that's not just storage in a traditional storage platform, it goes with the Compute, right, and for servers. I think, as you think about going forward, obviously, we'll continue to be very disciplined on pricing. In terms of commodity costs, but in particular, DRAM, we start seeing some declines, honestly. The curve is pointing downwards. But as I said before, and we lived this in 2018, right, when prices go up \u2013 when cost goes up, prices go up faster than when the cost goes down, it takes longer. But ultimately, the next-generation of Compute platform will drive even more richer configurations because there will be more per gigabyte per unit that will be attached to it. And so that's why we feel good about where we are today. But that's what we see in Compute right now is still very competitive, there's no question about it. But the demand is shifting between enterprise, public sector and obviously, the service provider segment.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Antonio, thanks for those comments around Compute, but I was also wondering clearly, backlog conversion was -- helped a great deal within the quarter's performance on Compute, but you also showed growth in Compute on a year-on-year basis after a very long time. How are you thinking about this sustainability? Not just sort of going one quarter out, but just more sustainability across the next several quarters in terms of Compute growth? And if you could also comment on the deterioration and growth in edge, that would be helpful. And I have a follow-up for Tarek.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. I mean, as I said before, everything in our life computes, which means Compute is embedded everywhere, not just in a server, and a lot of our storage platform is basically a compute platform with software, right? Big Data storage is a great example of that. It is an Apollo platform that runs our AI software on it. It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen there, but we saw steady demand again. We, obviously, are real locator resources, particularly in our go-to-market where we see the growth opportunity as well. And we will continue to drive what the focus is, particularly in areas like VDI, which is, in essence, is a Compute product with a bunch of software. Traditional Compute per se, in general purpose workloads, those obviously have been kind of weakened over time, been declining. But overall, I think a combination of AUPs, pricing, obviously, action and richer configuration, we should maintain a level of stability at this point in time considering that 2020 was fairly depressed overall. In terms of the edge, we believe we grew in line with the market. If I look at our competitors, what they announced, I think, is in line with the market. But we saw strength, as Tarek said, in switching, which was up sequentially 12%. Obviously, we continue to see quite a bit of strength in our subscription-based model with our Aruba platform. And also, we saw quite a bit of strength as well on the solutions around we provide, particularly of work solutions and remote connectivity. For us, this is a business that the long-term future. The thesis is totally intact. The Silver Peak acquisition will obviously accelerate the growth of Aruba going forward as well.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Antonio. And Tarek, you noted in your comments, the seasonality in Q4 around free cash flow that it wouldn't be up seasonally, it would be down. Can you help us think through where in working capital you see the headwinds in 4Q? Is it on the inventory side, which significantly improved here in the third quarter? And what sort of magnitude of restructuring we should expect in 4Q as well? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Okay. Well, thank you, Wamsi, for the question. So let me start by answering the latter part of your question on the magnitude at the restructuring, it's pretty much in line with the guidance we gave you in Q2 for fiscal year 2020, $300 million to $400 million is the cost we would incur for the restructuring. Now back to the first part of your question with respect to free cash flow, free cash flow was exceptionally strong in Q3, as we work through the backlog, right? So this has been very, very solid. And particularly, we were able to work through the backlog and improve the cash conversion cycle. Also, we benefited from temporary favorable timing of working capital, and that component will reverse in Q4. And so in Q4, like I mentioned in my script, expect free cash flow to be lower than Q3 as a result of two components: one is the restructuring costs and number two, the working capital changes, and specifically, if you want a little bit more guidance as to where in working capital the change will come, it's predominantly in payables that you will see a change that will be adverse to the generation of free cash flow.\nAntonio Neri: I think there is another piece of this Wamsi. Maybe, Tarek, you want to comment about the inventory side of the house because we believe there is a lot of fluidity there. It's very fluid. And also, there are some opportunities. Shannon asked that question. So we're going to play the market-based on what we see opportunity for us. And therefore, this \u2013 in the end, it comes down to really timing \u2013 the bottom line is timing.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes, that's absolutely right. So one of the reasons why you may wonder why we don't guide on free cash flow, although we guide on EPS, is because we do see opportunities that are available to us to take advantage of from an inventory position standpoint. And we want to retain the flexibility to be able to capitalize on those. Having said that, we do expect positive cash flow in Q4 lower than Q3 for the regions that I mentioned.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you put context around the $500 million of backlog worked down this quarter, as it relates to the overall size of excess backlog exiting April? And then as a follow-up, you talked about the really strong growth in GreenLake and customers shifting to OpEx models, but ARR growth did decelerate. Maybe talk through the factors that will get you back to the 30% to 40% growth target? And what the time line looks like in terms of hitting that growth profile? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Sure. So thank you, Katy, and I'm sure you will all be normalizing for backlog on every aspect of our business. So I want to take the opportunity to clarify this and leaving no shadows for doubt. So as you recall, in Q2, we said we exited with executable backlog in excess of $1.5 billion, which was 2x the level that we would normally see in our operation. So, essentially, $750 million above the level that we normally have in our business. We reduced that $750 million by $500 million in Q3. The rest, we believe, we can reduce by Q4. So even if you normalize for the $500 million, and I'll let you do all the calculations, you will see that the underlying revenue performance Q3 on Q2 is better. And also, if you really ask where did that backlog get reduced, in which segment, in particular? It was mainly Compute in a tiny bit in Storage, that's where the $500 million come from. And even if you look at Compute, back onto Wamsi's questions before, and you normalize for the reduction in backlog, you will observe that Compute was growing sequentially even after the normalization. We also want to underscore the fact that the backlog reduction hides a little bit what happens at the gross margin level, right? It\u2019s very difficult for you to see this at your end. But we did -- both of us reiterate the fact that, with the pricing actions we have taken and once you normalize for backlog, both Compute and Storage flow their underlying gross margins going up. And this is partly the reason why we've done so well in growing our gross profit 8% sequentially in the year. So that hopefully answers the backlog question, or part of your question. On GreenLake, its true what you\u2019re saying that, Q-on-Q the ARR decelerated, but the practical reality is, where you look at the lead indicators that make the ARR is the order growth. The order growth that we've had in Q3, it's the record -- it's at record levels. We didn't experience an 82% order growth in GreenLake and we feel very good about this order growth, because we're seeing bigger deals with larger companies and the companies that Antonio quoted are not small companies that typically start with a little spend that is variable on their IT infrastructure. These are bigger companies that are considering as-a-service consumption as a new way to handle their IT expenditures. So Antonio, maybe you would like to add to that?\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Actually, I will say a couple of things to that comment on the backlog, Katy, I mean this is product shipped, right? Not all that product was totally recognizable in the quarter, particularly in HPC. Because if you remember, right, in the HPC segment, we got to ship it, we have to install it, we have to turn it on, and we have to run the test. And only and only when the customer signs up for the acceptance, then we can recognize revenue. And that's why we still have quite an interesting opportunity in Q4 with HPC in particular. But in Compute, once you ship it, you recognize it. So, overall, very pleased with that. But even when you factor the backlog out, we actually grew sequentially on net new orders. And the net new orders, to Tarek's point, came at higher margins because of our pricing actions. The problem is the backlog was kind of dilutive to the margins because we price protect our customers, obviously, and we stand on that commitment and also the channel, right? On the GreenLake, I mean, this is an amazing performance. As I said in my comment, I think, is -- we believe, I believe, it's faster growth than any cloud out there. And it has -- it really comes down to the ability to provide a hybrid experience. What customers are telling us, they don't want to be in the wrong side of the house anymore, but they understand they have to have apps and data everywhere. 70% of the apps and data, still on-prem, by the way and more apps in data are moving to the edge. But ultimately, even if they have apps in public cloud, they like the GreenLake because it provides them the cost control, the managed aspect of it, and we can run it for them in a truly hybrid approach. And when they keep the apps and data on-prem, we give them the exact same consumption model, or whether they move it to the edge. And their value proposition is resonating more and more because the world is hybrid, cloud is an experience, and obviously, our software capabilities, they are playing a huge role together with our innovation on the business model side, and obviously, the financing. So that's what we see. And the ARR will take care of itself because, obviously, there is puts and takes because remember, ARR is a consumption-driven metric of it and as we go forward, we are very, very confident to confident to hit that 30% to 40%.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to revisit this question of demand trends and how backlog can impact it. So, the way that I think of it is, last quarter, you built backlog, so you didn\u2019t ship $500 million worth of stuff that you should have shipped and so if I adjust for that, last quarter should have been $500 million higher. In this quarter, you actually shipped that and recognized $500 million, and so this quarter, adjusting for backlog, should be $500 million lower. So, if I look at that year-over-year revenue ex the $500 million boost in backlog, it's down 13%. But more importantly, sequentially, if I make those two adjustments, revenue is actually down about 3% sequentially, which should be a reflection of orders, if I make the backlog adjustment, and that's below normal seasonal. And so A, is that incorrect, that analysis? And B, I'd like to understand why that wouldn't point to the fact that the order rate actually might be getting a little worse rather than getting a little better? And I have a follow-up, please.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes, Toni, hi it's Tarek here. So, your math is right. But operationally, things are slightly different, meaning if you normalize Q3 performance for the $500 million, yes, you get to $6.3 billion. But it's not entirely operationally correct to add the $500 million to Q2, because as part of the backlog, you do have orders that ship in-quarter but are not invoiced. You do have all, sorts of, different effects that come into play that distort that picture. So there is a limit to the normalization math that we can give. The simple point is, it's all about timing. Look, it's all about timing. This revenue should have materialized in fiscal year 2020. It is materializing in fiscal year 2020. And we're back to normalized levels of backlog by the end of fiscal year 2020. We've taken $500 million of backlog down. There's another -- you've done the math, $250 million to go. There's also another aspect that Antonio underscored before in HPC/MCS, it's very, very important for all of you to understand and it's the following. Specifically for that segment, it's slightly different than other segments because these systems are super sophisticated and even if we ship and land the system on customer premises, before we can actually invoice the customer, there's a technical acceptance process that takes place that delays our ability to invoice the customer. And so that is also fundamentally changing the trajectory of HPC/MCS, and we see very, very strong order demand in the public sector, which underpins the HPC/MCS segment, and you'll see the fruits of that in the foreseeable quarters. The conclusion of it is, whatever happens on backlog is an FY 2020 phenomenon driven by COVID, and they were essentially in Q1, the fact that we had, you remember, component shortages, and the whole industry experienced those. This translated into Q2 into manufacturing closures, where manufacturing was not at the full level. And then now, this issue has morphed into being specifically for HPC/MCS, a customer acceptance issue. So all-in-all, what matters is that the revenue of fiscal year 2020 is actually the same if you factor into the equation the fact that we will reduce the backlog we generated and we saw elevated at the end of Q2, we'll turn that into revenue by the end of Q4 in full.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah. I think, Toni, the other part is that we reduced the backlog by $500 million, but not all of that translated in Q3, because, again the HPC side of this, it takes -- sometimes takes weeks, some takes in months. We have installations, which are very large. It takes many, many weeks. And, obviously, the global pandemic, the COVID, is not allowing us to have a lot of people on-site for cabling and all that as well. And even if we ship it, in many cases, depending on the timing on the, kind of, more of the normal type of products, we may have a ship to not invoice, which basically, yeah, from the supply chain, it was taken care, but not from the revenue recognition perspective. That type of situation gets resolved, generally speaking, with a handful of weeks. On the HPC, it depends customer by customer. But the point on HPC is very strong. And, obviously, we have a go-forward amount of business, which is very sizable for us. And that's very good.\nToni Sacconaghi: So, thank you for that. If I could just quickly follow-up. So if order rates are steady and you still have $250 million-plus in backlog given HPC, should we be modeling normal seasonality, which is up maybe a couple of hundred million sequentially, plus $250 million to $300 million from backlog pushout? Is that -- isn't that the literal interpretation of what you're suggesting? And then just on the Compute margins, they were down 440 basis points year-over-year despite flat volumes. Is that really the impact of the rising component prices? And should we expect that to reverse pretty sharply as a result over the next couple of quarters as you pass through price increases? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Okay. So I'd say, in simple terms, if you want to model this with seasonality factors that you've outlined, that is potentially correct. The only major shift here is this: the tide has come down across the industry. And it's not just for us, but overall, the level of demand is not going to be very quickly resuming to the levels we witnessed in fiscal year 2019. So the year-over-year compares that you're seeing are less and less meaningful. And what matters more is what happens on a sequential basis. This is why we are accentuating where we are recovering from Q2 into Q3 and now Q4 with the dynamics that Antonio mentioned with respect to HPC & MCS and customer acceptances. Toni, I apologize, could you repeat the second part of your question? I'm not sure I remember it.\nToni Sacconaghi: Just Compute margins year-over-year, down 440, and does that improve as you pass along DRAM pricing?\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. The answer is yes, Toni. That is correct. We've taken pricing actions. And as Antonio said, in these situations, we've lived those before in 2018, as we raise prices, the margin expands, and the commodity costs take longer to normalize or to revert back into a position when margins are deteriorating. And so we do believe that at least in the short term, if the DRAM pressure continues, we will see margin expansion in Compute.\nAntonio Neri: And the only thing I said, Toni, just to wrap the first part is that we feel confident that we will continue to see performance improvement as we go forward on a sequential basis. Question is, by how much? But the reality is about timing, it's about all these things that we just cover, converting orders and then ultimately be able to recognize revenue. But at this time, time, my early comments what we expect continued sequential performance improvement as we move forward.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRod Hall: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll make them quick as you're done at the end of the hour here. I wanted to ask back on Compute. I think, Tarek, you had said AUPs are up 3% sequentially. Could you say what that is year-over-year on AUP for Compute and then I'll just give you my follow-up now, so you don't have to come back to it. Could you just comment, maybe Antonio or Tarek, on visibility that you've got right now on demand, given your little bit better commentary on demand than what we've heard from some other big enterprise players? Thanks.\nTarek Robbiati: Sure, Rod. Thanks for the question. So I'll say in Compute, units grew 36% quarter-on-quarter while AUP grew 3% quarter-on-quarter. I know you want the AUP on a year-over-year basis. I don't have that handy with you. I can follow-up and let you know what the answer is and the IR team will do that. And the second part of your question?\nAntonio Neri: And the second part of the question is about the demand visibility. As I said, depends by customer segment, depends by offer. Ultimately, what I see at this point in time has been steady. But the reality is that there are areas that are stronger and the areas are weaker. But I think it points to the diversification of our portfolio. We have a unique portfolio, and that's why we have a unique strategy to become the platform edge to cloud. And I think, as I think about that, obviously, there is a lot of opportunities, particularly as we continue to pivot the company with more software and services-oriented type of offers. And you can see even in Q3, some of the strength with big data Storage in our Primera, which is a software, in essence it\u2019s a software offering based on InfoSight, up over 100%. So these are the things that will continue to drive growth. And if we can sustain, the question that was asked about the Compute momentum, then you get that continued improvement, which we believe will be the case. But HPC plays a huge role for us. Let me be clear about HPC, I am very bullish about that business.\nTarek Robbiati: And Rod, let me follow-up on the AUP questions on a year-over-year basis. On a year-over-year basis, units grew 3% and AUP was down 2%. That is the answer you were looking for. And on visibility, look, in simple terms, it's better than in Q2, and that's the reason why we provide guidance. If we didn't have a confidence, we wouldn't be providing guidance, if visibility were to be too low or too uncertain for us to do so.\nOperator: And our final question today will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for squeezing me in guys. I just have a question around your margin structure. Fairly impressive, I think, 100 basis points of margin uptick you guys saw sequentially. But when I kind of break it up, it looks like gross margins were down 170 basis points, and maybe more than made up for that in SG&A and R&D curtailment. So could you just maybe talk about first half gross margin decline? Was that all mix, or were there other factors involved in it? That would be helpful. And then, the OpEx run rate you have today, is this a steady state number we could think about as we go forward, or was there more one-off things that helped you curtail it? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you, Amit, for the question. So, yes, your observation is right. The gross margin went down 160 basis points, as highlighted in our announcement, and we more than made that at the OP margin level, with the OP margin at 7.1%. So what's driving that at the gross margin level is purely the mix. We had more Compute revenue at lower margin, it's a mix issue. We did also articulate the fact that if you normalize for backlog, we did have an impact on gross margins, both in Compute and Storage our gross margins would be up. But also, what you can see at OP margin is the fact that we are starting to take cost out and we are incurring restructuring costs as a result of this. I want to take the opportunity to remind everyone about our cost optimization and prioritization plan that we announced in Q2. We took proactive steps to strengthen our financial profile. I would tell you, I take a lot pride about this one, because we were present and we did it on time, being hit very hard in a full quarter of Q2 that was disrupted by COVID. And we are on track with that program to generate net annualized run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year 2022 relative to the fiscal year 2019 exit level and with most of those savings achieved at the end of fiscal year 2021. So hopefully, that should give you some comfort with respect to also the visibility point, and that's why we're saying, we expect gradual performance improvements going forward, knowing that we have taken actions with this core transformation program that is about prioritizing and reducing costs where we can find opportunities to do so.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. I will say, just to wrap that up, I know that was the last question, there is always quite interesting and significant opportunities. Remember that HPE Next was a very successful program for us and for our shareholders, and this is the next iteration. But most importantly, this is all about executing our strategy and align our resources to where we believe the growth is and continue to make this company even more efficient on a foundation of work we did the last three years. So, that's why we are very, very confident about that and we have a very strong discipline and track record to be honest with you, while at the same time, we focus on innovation. So, I know we went a little bit longer, but we felt that it was important to give you as much clarity and insight as possible. Again, I will wrap up by saying very pleased with Q3. This was a quarter marked by strong execution and honestly, very strong sequential growth. While much of the uncertainty is still there in the market and the global pandemic is still with us, we actually are cautiously optimistic, and we will see quarter-over-quarter improvements going forward across our businesses. And at the same time, we are investing into the future, which is essential for us, but I'm very pleased with our execution in the Pivot-as-a-Service. You can see the momentum there. Hopefully, we will see you in October at the virtual event for the Security Analyst Meeting. Thank you for your time and I hope to talk to you soon.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call today. Thank you for attending and you may now disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Thanks, Sonalee, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Overall, I am pleased with our Q3 performance. We executed well to enable strong sequential growth across our businesses. We gained momentum in key areas of differentiation, driven by customer demand aligned to our strategy, and we began to take decisive and prudent actions to strengthen our core financial foundation, while we continue to align resources to critical areas of growth. COVID-19 has forced fundamental changes in businesses and communities. These changes have further validated our strategy. Navigating through the pandemic and planning for a post-COVID world has increased customer needs for other service offerings, secure connectivity, remote work capabilities and analytics to unlock insights from data. Our solutions are aligned to these needs, and we see a tremendous opportunity to help our customers transform and digitize their businesses as they continue to adapt and operate in our new world. Let me review a few highlights from the quarter. Total net revenue of $6.8 billion was up 14% quarter-over-quarter and non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. Compute, HPC & MCS, Storage, and Intelligent Edge business segments also grew sequentially. Moving forward, we expect continued gradual performance improvement. We made significant improvements in our supply chain execution, reducing our backlog by more than $500 million from our Q2 historical high exit levels, which contributed to our results. In our HPC business, COVID-related impacts continued to affect our customers' ability to accept delivery of our products. We expect to return to normalized level of backlog by the end of Q4 through continued improvements in both supply chain execution and customer acceptances. Our pivot to as-a-service continued its strong momentum in the quarter. Our annualized revenue run rate of $528 million grew 11% year-over-year. GreenLake services orders grew a record 82% year-over-year. We believe this is faster than the orders growth of public cloud vendors and it is a validation of our hyper strategy and competitive differentiation. We are focused on delivering one seamless cloud experience for all applications and data, no matter where they exist; at the edge, in a data center, in a colocation, or in a public cloud estate. While others are public now publicly declaring plans to offer Everything-as-a-Service, we have been focused on this for several years and have made significant organic and inorganic investments to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers. Our Q3 free cash flow of $924 million was up $276 million year-over-year, driven by a record cash flow from operations as a result of our improved execution this quarter. Importantly, we also declared our Q4 dividend today. Dividends remain an important part of our capital allocation framework that consists of capital return to shareholders and strategic investments that together drive long-term shareholder value. Our customers are managing through the pandemic with even greater needs for the capabilities HP can uniquely provide. In June, we put our strategy in the spotlight at our Discover Virtual Experience event, where we introduced new breakthrough innovation on a global virtual stage. The new solutions we introduced support our position that cloud is an experience, not a destination, and they're already gaining traction with our customers. We launched our next-generation of HP GreenLake Cloud Services. These new cloud services span machine learning operations, container management, virtualization, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, data protection and Connectivity-as-a-Service. Now, our customers can access all of our HP GreenLake Cloud services via a soft service point-and-click catalog on our HP GreenLake Central Cloud Portal. Notably, in Q3, we signed several of our largest HPE GreenLake Cloud services deals in history, including LyondellBasell, one of the largest plastics, chemicals, and refining companies in the world who signed a $27 million HP GreenLake deal to drive their digital transformation and environmental efficiency. Underpinning our customers' cloud experience is the need for software. That is why we introduce our new HPE Ezmeral software portfolio. Our new portfolio includes a container platform that deploys Kubernetes at scale for a wide range of use cases on bare-metal and virtual machines. A data fabric that delivers enterprise-wide global access to data from edge-to-cloud with best-in-class reliability, security and performance, and machine learning operations solution that increases speed and agility for machine learning ops by operationalizing end-to-end processes from pilot to production, as well as IT operations and automation to improve productivity and mitigate risk of service disruption. In addition, it enables our customer to control cost and compliance across their hybrid cloud estate through our managed cloud controls capabilities built into the portfolio. HPE Ezmeral can be consumed as a license or as a part of our HPE GreenLake Cloud Services offering. And just a few weeks ago, as a strong endorsement of our strategy and capabilities, we announced plans to partner with SAP to deliver the customer addition of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake Cloud Services. This new joint solution will help customers leverage our cloud capabilities, while keeping their SAP workloads and data on-premises. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our core capabilities in Storage and Compute, which are essential resources to store and process customers' data. Every 60 seconds, we ship 46 terabytes of storage in four servers. Despite the challenging market that impacted our storage performance overall, in Q3, we saw sequential improvement of 4%, and importantly, we gained traction and grew in key areas of investment. Big Data storage, which is built on unique intellectual property from our MapR acquisition to enable real-time analytics for mission critical Big Data overloads, grew revenues 31% year-over-year. Nimble distributed HCI, our new hyper-converged solution for business-critical applications and mixed overloads of scale grew revenue at 112% year-over-year. And a great example of our organic innovation is HP Primera, our most intelligent storage platform, grew revenues 114% year-over-year. HP Primera gained 104 new logos this quarter, with nearly one-quarter of those being new to HP Storage. We saw strong sequential momentum with HPC in mission-critical systems that grew 10%, including a 10-year deal of $125 million with the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who chose HPE to power the Edinburgh International Data Facility with our industry-leading HPC and AI solutions. And finally, we had a very solid quarter in Compute, with 29% quarter-over-quarter growth, driven by the reduction in backlog and customer demand in VDI, or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure solutions. For example, Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands wanted to upgrade its VDI environment for life cycle management needs and to prepare for future waves of COVID-19. We introduced a complete composable hyper-converged infrastructure solution based on HPE Synergy, along with HPE Primera to meet their needs. Our Intelligent Edge business performed in line with the market in Q3. We continue to see the edge as a significant opportunity over the long-term. The explosion of data devices and application will drive demand for secure multi-protocol connectivity, analytics and cloud computing capabilities at the Edge, especially in the post-COVID world. We are now entering the edge of insights, driven by the amount of data we are generating and the utilization of new analytic tools, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. Customers are looking to power a new breed of applications and workloads that work in concert with the cloud, but analyze and process data at the edge. To enable these new customer needs, we introduced the Aruba Edge services platform, or Aruba ESP, the industry first AI-powered cloud platform designed for to unify, automate and secure the edge. The Aruba ESP combines AIOps, Aruba Zero Trust security and a unified infrastructure with financial and consumption flexibility. And we are seeing early customer adoption. Noble Hospitality, a luxury lifestyle brand is standardizing on our Aruba Edge services platform as their edge cloud foundation for the hotel chain. The ability to generate actionable analytics where the data is created and deliver new on-property experiences for guests was critical to their decision. We also announced our plans to acquire SD-WAN leader Silver Peak. Silver Peak's advanced SD-WAN offerings strengthened our Aruba ESP and complements Aruba's existing work-from-home and branch office solutions to deliver one of the industry's most comprehensive portfolios designed to securely connect any edge to any cloud. The combination, which is expected to close in Q4 of this fiscal year, will allow enterprise customers to simplify their branch office and one deployments to empower remote workforces, enable cloud-native deployments and transform business operations without compromising quality or reliability. These are great example of accelerating our strategy while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Building on our 5G Core Stack launched in March, we introduced a new Telco Edge Orchestrator Solution for telecom operators. This new solution provides revenue opportunities for telecoms in the enterprise market with one-click deployment of applications at the edge of the new 5G networks. We are receiving positive feedback on our 5G offerings. For example, we announced an innovative technical demonstration of an automated virtual 5G network conducted with a French telecom operator, Orange, and telco infrastructure solutions provider Casa systems. The demo highlights the expanding use cases and service agility needed to support 5G business applications, including location-based telemetry, IoT, edge computing and more that will require low latency. Our ability to innovate for our customers is made possible by strong financial management that strengthen our core financial foundation and allows us to align resources to the most critical areas. As we exited Q2, you will recall that we took a number of decisive and prudent actions to manage our business through the evolving impacts of COVID-19. This included several short-term initiatives to reduce operating expenses and drive efficiencies as well as the introduction of a long-term cost optimization and prioritization plan designed to accelerate sustainable profitable growth. We remain on track to deliver the annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year 2022, driven by optimizing our workplace site strategy, simplifying our product portfolio and introducing new digital customer engagement models. These efforts, backed by our diversified portfolio, robust balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, will allow us to continue to invest in key growth areas. In closing, I am proud of our Q3 performance, and I am proud of our HPE team. Our team members have been steadfast partners for our customers through an unprecedented period. They have moved quickly to address rapidly evolving market conditions. They have innovated with our customers in mind. They have made personal sacrifices to invest in our company's future. They have passionately committed to help HPE play a role in shaping a more equitable and inclusive society. And they have done all of this, while managing the challenges of living through a global pandemic. Put it more simply, my HP colleagues have represented our values, labor culture and deliver on our purpose to advance the way people even work. As a result of the efforts, HP is stronger and better able to serve our customers, partners and communities in a world that's forever changed. While we continue to navigate through the global pandemic and macro uncertainty, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see gradual quarter-over-quarter performance improvement going forward. This is why we are providing guidance for our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP EPS, which Tarek will discuss. We look forward to seeing you virtually at our security Analyst meeting on October 15, where we will provide more details about our long-term plans. And with that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results. All right. Thank you, Tarek Yes. Thank you, Shannon. So, I spent probably 50% of my time talking to customers and partners. So, I have a pretty good insight of what we see in the market. What we see right now, first of all, and I made this comment in my remarks, we see steady demand and obviously, there are areas which are stronger than others. But the general sense is as follows; first of all, they're looking to strengthen their operations, and therefore, IT plays a huge role with that, and IT resiliency is more important than ever. So, anything that comes with security and enables them to digitize their processes is on the growth side. Second is, obviously, they have a lot of data and they need to get insight from that data and we see an acceleration of solutions related to AI and machine learning, and that's why our big data storage saw another great solid performance. But obviously, MLOps, and that's why we introduced an offer with HP GreenLake Cloud Services around machine learning operations is a high demand. Obviously, as we look at the workforce and I think there are permanent and lasting changes to how we're going to work in the future, remote connectivity is essential. And that's why I'm so excited about the acquisition of Silver Peak, because together with Aruba services platform, give us now the ability to provide connectivity for all the edges and the edge now is your home office, right? I consider that the micro branch to any cloud. And obviously, there are multiple clouds, because it's a hybrid strategy. And then anything that preserves CapEx is also in high demand. And that's why we see significant momentum with our HP GreenLake Cloud services, because that's a true conceived as-a-service offering. And so obviously, that's in transition, right? We see -- what we see is a transition period. But I would say the enterprise has been steady. Obviously, SMBE is a challenge. From the customer segmentation perspective, is a challenge. When I look at the verticals, I think the financial sector where you play is still very sector where you play is still very solid and the manufacturing side as well. Education, obviously, now is going to be very important. And in the public sector, the public sector is very strong. And obviously, we have a unique portfolio there with our HPC and AI solutions, but also around Storage as well. So, that's the general theme, Shannon, that we see at this point in time. In terms of budgets, obviously, they are assessing what happens in the context of their own revenues and profit. But overall, I will say the enterprise, which is where we participate the most, is fairly steady. And that's why Tarek meant, we have a very diversified and resilient portfolio, both by customer segment and by solution. Sure. The Compute business performed really well, 29% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. And we did a very good job in reducing the backlog. There's still some -- but that's why we feel very confident that we can totally get back to the historical levels by the end of Q4. We grew sequentially double digits in units, in AUP 3%. If you recall, commodity cost has been inflationary in the first part of the year, and we took quite significant actions on pricing. And that's why our AUPs went up because of pricing, but also because of the structural changes we continue to see in that type of products. I mentioned, we shipped 46 terabytes of storage. And that's not just storage in a traditional storage platform, it goes with the Compute, right, and for servers. I think, as you think about going forward, obviously, we'll continue to be very disciplined on pricing. In terms of commodity costs, but in particular, DRAM, we start seeing some declines, honestly. The curve is pointing downwards. But as I said before, and we lived this in 2018, right, when prices go up \u2013 when cost goes up, prices go up faster than when the cost goes down, it takes longer. But ultimately, the next-generation of Compute platform will drive even more richer configurations because there will be more per gigabyte per unit that will be attached to it. And so that's why we feel good about where we are today. But that's what we see in Compute right now is still very competitive, there's no question about it. But the demand is shifting between enterprise, public sector and obviously, the service provider segment. Sure. I mean, as I said before, everything in our life computes, which means Compute is embedded everywhere, not just in a server, and a lot of our storage platform is basically a compute platform with software, right? Big Data storage is a great example of that. It is an Apollo platform that runs our AI software on it. It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen there, but we saw steady demand again. We, obviously, are real locator resources, particularly in our go-to-market where we see the growth opportunity as well. And we will continue to drive what the focus is, particularly in areas like VDI, which is, in essence, is a Compute product with a bunch of software. Traditional Compute per se, in general purpose workloads, those obviously have been kind of weakened over time, been declining. But overall, I think a combination of AUPs, pricing, obviously, action and richer configuration, we should maintain a level of stability at this point in time considering that 2020 was fairly depressed overall. In terms of the edge, we believe we grew in line with the market. If I look at our competitors, what they announced, I think, is in line with the market. But we saw strength, as Tarek said, in switching, which was up sequentially 12%. Obviously, we continue to see quite a bit of strength in our subscription-based model with our Aruba platform. And also, we saw quite a bit of strength as well on the solutions around we provide, particularly of work solutions and remote connectivity. For us, this is a business that the long-term future. The thesis is totally intact. The Silver Peak acquisition will obviously accelerate the growth of Aruba going forward as well. I think there is another piece of this Wamsi. Maybe, Tarek, you want to comment about the inventory side of the house because we believe there is a lot of fluidity there. It's very fluid. And also, there are some opportunities. Shannon asked that question. So we're going to play the market-based on what we see opportunity for us. And therefore, this \u2013 in the end, it comes down to really timing \u2013 the bottom line is timing. Yes. Actually, I will say a couple of things to that comment on the backlog, Katy, I mean this is product shipped, right? Not all that product was totally recognizable in the quarter, particularly in HPC. Because if you remember, right, in the HPC segment, we got to ship it, we have to install it, we have to turn it on, and we have to run the test. And only and only when the customer signs up for the acceptance, then we can recognize revenue. And that's why we still have quite an interesting opportunity in Q4 with HPC in particular. But in Compute, once you ship it, you recognize it. So, overall, very pleased with that. But even when you factor the backlog out, we actually grew sequentially on net new orders. And the net new orders, to Tarek's point, came at higher margins because of our pricing actions. The problem is the backlog was kind of dilutive to the margins because we price protect our customers, obviously, and we stand on that commitment and also the channel, right? On the GreenLake, I mean, this is an amazing performance. As I said in my comment, I think, is -- we believe, I believe, it's faster growth than any cloud out there. And it has -- it really comes down to the ability to provide a hybrid experience. What customers are telling us, they don't want to be in the wrong side of the house anymore, but they understand they have to have apps and data everywhere. 70% of the apps and data, still on-prem, by the way and more apps in data are moving to the edge. But ultimately, even if they have apps in public cloud, they like the GreenLake because it provides them the cost control, the managed aspect of it, and we can run it for them in a truly hybrid approach. And when they keep the apps and data on-prem, we give them the exact same consumption model, or whether they move it to the edge. And their value proposition is resonating more and more because the world is hybrid, cloud is an experience, and obviously, our software capabilities, they are playing a huge role together with our innovation on the business model side, and obviously, the financing. So that's what we see. And the ARR will take care of itself because, obviously, there is puts and takes because remember, ARR is a consumption-driven metric of it and as we go forward, we are very, very confident to confident to hit that 30% to 40%. Yeah. I think, Toni, the other part is that we reduced the backlog by $500 million, but not all of that translated in Q3, because, again the HPC side of this, it takes -- sometimes takes weeks, some takes in months. We have installations, which are very large. It takes many, many weeks. And, obviously, the global pandemic, the COVID, is not allowing us to have a lot of people on-site for cabling and all that as well. And even if we ship it, in many cases, depending on the timing on the, kind of, more of the normal type of products, we may have a ship to not invoice, which basically, yeah, from the supply chain, it was taken care, but not from the revenue recognition perspective. That type of situation gets resolved, generally speaking, with a handful of weeks. On the HPC, it depends customer by customer. But the point on HPC is very strong. And, obviously, we have a go-forward amount of business, which is very sizable for us. And that's very good. Okay. So I'd say, in simple terms, if you want to model this with seasonality factors that you've outlined, that is potentially correct. The only major shift here is this: the tide has come down across the industry. And it's not just for us, but overall, the level of demand is not going to be very quickly resuming to the levels we witnessed in fiscal year 2019. So the year-over-year compares that you're seeing are less and less meaningful. And what matters more is what happens on a sequential basis. This is why we are accentuating where we are recovering from Q2 into Q3 and now Q4 with the dynamics that Antonio mentioned with respect to HPC & MCS and customer acceptances. Toni, I apologize, could you repeat the second part of your question? I'm not sure I remember it. And the only thing I said, Toni, just to wrap the first part is that we feel confident that we will continue to see performance improvement as we go forward on a sequential basis. Question is, by how much? But the reality is about timing, it's about all these things that we just cover, converting orders and then ultimately be able to recognize revenue. But at this time, time, my early comments what we expect continued sequential performance improvement as we move forward. And the second part of the question is about the demand visibility. As I said, depends by customer segment, depends by offer. Ultimately, what I see at this point in time has been steady. But the reality is that there are areas that are stronger and the areas are weaker. But I think it points to the diversification of our portfolio. We have a unique portfolio, and that's why we have a unique strategy to become the platform edge to cloud. And I think, as I think about that, obviously, there is a lot of opportunities, particularly as we continue to pivot the company with more software and services-oriented type of offers. And you can see even in Q3, some of the strength with big data Storage in our Primera, which is a software, in essence it's a software offering based on InfoSight, up over 100%. So these are the things that will continue to drive growth. And if we can sustain, the question that was asked about the Compute momentum, then you get that continued improvement, which we believe will be the case. But HPC plays a huge role for us. Let me be clear about HPC, I am very bullish about that business. Yes. I will say, just to wrap that up, I know that was the last question, there is always quite interesting and significant opportunities. Remember that HPE Next was a very successful program for us and for our shareholders, and this is the next iteration. But most importantly, this is all about executing our strategy and align our resources to where we believe the growth is and continue to make this company even more efficient on a foundation of work we did the last three years. So, that's why we are very, very confident about that and we have a very strong discipline and track record to be honest with you, while at the same time, we focus on innovation. So, I know we went a little bit longer, but we felt that it was important to give you as much clarity and insight as possible. Again, I will wrap up by saying very pleased with Q3. This was a quarter marked by strong execution and honestly, very strong sequential growth. While much of the uncertainty is still there in the market and the global pandemic is still with us, we actually are cautiously optimistic, and we will see quarter-over-quarter improvements going forward across our businesses. And at the same time, we are investing into the future, which is essential for us, but I'm very pleased with our execution in the Pivot-as-a-Service. You can see the momentum there. Hopefully, we will see you in October at the virtual event for the Security Analyst Meeting. Thank you for your time and I hope to talk to you soon."

            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, let me remind you that since the start of the fiscal year, we are reporting results according to our new segmentation. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on slide four. Now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with slide five. Q3 was characterized by strong execution, driving sequential growth. We delivered Q3 revenues of $6.8 billion, up 14% sequentially and down 4% from the prior year period. I am especially pleased to report that we have made significant progress in clearing our backlog by more than $500 million during the quarter. We expect a return to normalized backlog levels as we exit Q4 2020. As a result, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 8% sequentially to $2.1 billion in Q3. Non-GAAP gross margins were 30.4% this quarter, down 160 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of compute as we executed against our backlog from prior quarters. Normalizing for the effect of backlog, both our compute and storage business segments grew gross margin on a sequential basis. Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% sequentially, resulting in a 7.1% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 was up 45% sequentially. Our GAAP EPS was $0.01 as we accelerated our transformation program and incurred restructuring costs. Q3 cash flow from operations was approximately $1.5 billion, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million, up $276 million from the prior year period, driven primarily by favorable working capital movements that I will detail later. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable October 7, 2020. Let's move to slide six, which shows our performance in the quarter by segment. Here are the highlights. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew revenues 3% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the market. While wireless LAN declined single-digits sequentially, we grew the campus switching business 12% quarter-over-quarter. In North America, our largest geo, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating our continued momentum. Operating margin in Q3 was 8.6%, down 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter, impacted primarily by higher logistics and duties costs in this current environment. In Compute, revenue grew 29% quarter-over-quarter as we executed against the backlog and improved our supply chain execution. Not only did units grow strong double-digits sequentially, AUP grew 3% quarter-on-quarter as well. The increased operating leverage in this segment resulted in an operating profit margin of 8.5%, up 380 basis points quarter-over-quarter. In High Performance Compute & Mission Critical Systems, revenue grew 10% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong performance in Edge Compute, HPC Apollo, and MCS, up sequentially 82%, 16%, and 2%, respectively. We expect to see sequential momentum next quarter driven by increased customer acceptance for HPC/MCS and Cray as we execute against the order book across the portfolio. Most importantly, Cray remains on track to deliver both on its FY 2020 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by the end of fiscal year 2021. Within Storage, we grew revenue 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong operational execution across the segment portfolio of products and reduction of backlog to normalized levels. With respect to Pointnext operational services, which is included across our Compute, HPC/MCS, and Storage segments, total revenue was down 2%, while orders grew 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold continued to be strong with solid double-digit growth on a sequential basis across all segments; Compute, Storage and HPC/MCS. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust. In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was down 4% sequentially as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. This business is strategically important for us as it helps customers navigate through their digital transformation and also pull-through significant infrastructure and operational services orders. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 1% quarter-over-quarter despite the impact of COVID-19, and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter, driven primarily by FX movements. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 74 basis points, which was slightly higher than previous quarters is still best-in-class within this industry. I am particularly pleased by the collection performance in HPEFS, which attests to the quality of the book and the HPEFS franchise overall. I will come back to that later on. Our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investment segment is strategically important to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. Revenue was down 4% sequentially due to first half slowdown in services bookings. However, due to our improved cost of delivery, we're able to expand operating margins by 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud native telco networks functions. Slide 7 shows our growing ARR profile, which I introduced at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. I am very pleased to report that our Q3 2020 ARR came in at $528 million, representing 11% year-over-year growth. GreenLake Service orders were up 82% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by outstanding performance in North America, which delivered 5x year-over-year growth. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue strong double digits year-over-year as well. Based on strong customer demand, I am confident to reiterate our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2022. Slide 8 highlights our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.32 in Q3, up 45% sequentially from Q2 driven by improved operating leverage, cost control and lower OI&E expenses. We now expect fiscal year 2020 OI&E to be significantly less than our $100 million expense guidance provided at SAM 2019, driven by higher earnings from equity interest in HPC, and better cost of debt resulting from our balance sheet funding diversification strategy that I will elaborate further on. Turning to gross margin on slide 9. And as I mentioned previously, non-GAAP gross profit was up 8% sequentially due to improved operating leverage. At 30.4% of revenues, our gross margin was down 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter driven by higher mix of compute as we executed against our elevated backlog from the prior quarter. Most importantly, and normalizing for the effect of backlog, both Compute and Storage business segments grew gross margins on a sequential basis. Moving to slide 10. Non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1% in Q3 of fiscal year 2020 and non-GAAP operating income of $484 million was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. A combination of improved operating leverage and disciplined cost controls enabled us to improve profitability on a sequential basis. Last quarter, let me say this, we were prescient by proactively announcing the head of other industry players, a cost optimization and prioritization plan that would deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year 2022. We are making excellent progress there and are very much on track to emerge stronger in the post-COVID world. The actions we outlined as part of that plan to transform our core by optimizing our cost structure and aligning our resources through deep segmentation to key growth areas are now clearly starting to bear fruit. Turning to Slide 11. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $1.5 billion. This is the highest level for the past 11 quarters, as we improved our operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements that resulted in favorability in Q3. Overall, we saw an improvement in our cash conversion cycle for minus five days in the prior quarter to minus 10 days this quarter. For Q4, we expect free cash flow to be sequentially lower, mainly due to two reasons: number one, working capital will be a use of cash; and number two, higher restructuring payments related to our core transformation plan we announced in Q2. As you recall, during the lockdown, we discussed our company exposure by industry vertical and company size, and explain in detail that our business is highly resilient. As a proof point, I would like to highlight the performance of our credit collection teams in both our operating company and in HPEFS. Thanks to their contribution during the quarter, the level of our ARR that is current is at a record high of 99.5%, which attest of the strength of the HPE business and the quality of our franchise. Now moving on to Slide 12, I want to spend a moment to talk about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position and provide some insight on the puts and takes on forthcoming adjustments to our cash and debt positions. As of our 31st of July quarter end, we had approximately $8.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $1.75 billion in senior notes in July 2020 at a low-cost of debt. Post the quarter end, we redeemed $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $10.3 billion of liquidity after the redemption of the notes maturing in October 2020. Additionally, we expect to pay $925 million cash when we complete the proposed acquisition of Silver Peak, which is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal year 2020. Adjusted for these known changes, our opco gross debt would be lower by $3 billion to approximately $4.4 billion, and our opco cash will also be lower by $3.9 billion to approximately $4 billion, resulting in an opco net debt of approximately $400 million. Separately, we have securitized some Financial Services-related debt through the ABS market in the U.S., and as of July 301st quarter end, we have approximately $2.1 billion in outstanding ABS issuances. The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at cheaper cost of capital, which helps diversify our balance sheet and lower interest expense payments in the future. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in July 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy. Now turning to outlook on slide 13. Given the progress made in our operations, we are now in a position to provide guidance on fiscal year 2020 EPS. We expect to finish fiscal year 2020 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.34, and we expect our fiscal year 2020 GAAP diluted net loss per share to be between $0.35 and $0.31. Let me recap our key takeaways for this quarter on slide 14. We delivered strong sequential improvement in top and bottom line and significantly improved operational and supply chain execution. We also accelerated our as-a-service pivot with very strong momentum in ARR and record GreenLake Services order growth. We're taking actions to strengthen our financial foundation and align resources to critical areas to transform our core and drive sustainable profitable growth. At this stage, given all of this, we expect gradual sequential performance improvement moving forward. In Q3, we paid $154 million in dividends to shareholders. We recognized that dividends are an important part of our capital allocation framework and returns to shareholders. And today we are very pleased to declare a Q4 dividend of $0.12 per share payable on October 7, 2020. On a personal note, I'd like to echo Antonio's comments. We are both very proud of the way our company and team members quickly and decisively responded to the unprecedented challenges that the global COVID-19 pandemic has caused. As Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us at our Virtual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15, where we will provide an update on our strategy, financial outlook and capital management policy. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you. Okay. Well, thank you, Wamsi, for the question. So let me start by answering the latter part of your question on the magnitude at the restructuring, it's pretty much in line with the guidance we gave you in Q2 for fiscal year 2020, $300 million to $400 million is the cost we would incur for the restructuring. Now back to the first part of your question with respect to free cash flow, free cash flow was exceptionally strong in Q3, as we work through the backlog, right? So this has been very, very solid. And particularly, we were able to work through the backlog and improve the cash conversion cycle. Also, we benefited from temporary favorable timing of working capital, and that component will reverse in Q4. And so in Q4, like I mentioned in my script, expect free cash flow to be lower than Q3 as a result of two components: one is the restructuring costs and number two, the working capital changes, and specifically, if you want a little bit more guidance as to where in working capital the change will come, it's predominantly in payables that you will see a change that will be adverse to the generation of free cash flow. Yes, that's absolutely right. So one of the reasons why you may wonder why we don't guide on free cash flow, although we guide on EPS, is because we do see opportunities that are available to us to take advantage of from an inventory position standpoint. And we want to retain the flexibility to be able to capitalize on those. Having said that, we do expect positive cash flow in Q4 lower than Q3 for the regions that I mentioned. Sure. So thank you, Katy, and I'm sure you will all be normalizing for backlog on every aspect of our business. So I want to take the opportunity to clarify this and leaving no shadows for doubt. So as you recall, in Q2, we said we exited with executable backlog in excess of $1.5 billion, which was 2x the level that we would normally see in our operation. So, essentially, $750 million above the level that we normally have in our business. We reduced that $750 million by $500 million in Q3. The rest, we believe, we can reduce by Q4. So even if you normalize for the $500 million, and I'll let you do all the calculations, you will see that the underlying revenue performance Q3 on Q2 is better. And also, if you really ask where did that backlog get reduced, in which segment, in particular? It was mainly Compute in a tiny bit in Storage, that's where the $500 million come from. And even if you look at Compute, back onto Wamsi's questions before, and you normalize for the reduction in backlog, you will observe that Compute was growing sequentially even after the normalization. We also want to underscore the fact that the backlog reduction hides a little bit what happens at the gross margin level, right? It's very difficult for you to see this at your end. But we did -- both of us reiterate the fact that, with the pricing actions we have taken and once you normalize for backlog, both Compute and Storage flow their underlying gross margins going up. And this is partly the reason why we've done so well in growing our gross profit 8% sequentially in the year. So that hopefully answers the backlog question, or part of your question. On GreenLake, its true what you're saying that, Q-on-Q the ARR decelerated, but the practical reality is, where you look at the lead indicators that make the ARR is the order growth. The order growth that we've had in Q3, it's the record -- it's at record levels. We didn't experience an 82% order growth in GreenLake and we feel very good about this order growth, because we're seeing bigger deals with larger companies and the companies that Antonio quoted are not small companies that typically start with a little spend that is variable on their IT infrastructure. These are bigger companies that are considering as-a-service consumption as a new way to handle their IT expenditures. So Antonio, maybe you would like to add to that? Yes, Toni, hi it's Tarek here. So, your math is right. But operationally, things are slightly different, meaning if you normalize Q3 performance for the $500 million, yes, you get to $6.3 billion. But it's not entirely operationally correct to add the $500 million to Q2, because as part of the backlog, you do have orders that ship in-quarter but are not invoiced. You do have all, sorts of, different effects that come into play that distort that picture. So there is a limit to the normalization math that we can give. The simple point is, it's all about timing. Look, it's all about timing. This revenue should have materialized in fiscal year 2020. It is materializing in fiscal year 2020. And we're back to normalized levels of backlog by the end of fiscal year 2020. We've taken $500 million of backlog down. There's another -- you've done the math, $250 million to go. There's also another aspect that Antonio underscored before in HPC/MCS, it's very, very important for all of you to understand and it's the following. Specifically for that segment, it's slightly different than other segments because these systems are super sophisticated and even if we ship and land the system on customer premises, before we can actually invoice the customer, there's a technical acceptance process that takes place that delays our ability to invoice the customer. And so that is also fundamentally changing the trajectory of HPC/MCS, and we see very, very strong order demand in the public sector, which underpins the HPC/MCS segment, and you'll see the fruits of that in the foreseeable quarters. The conclusion of it is, whatever happens on backlog is an FY 2020 phenomenon driven by COVID, and they were essentially in Q1, the fact that we had, you remember, component shortages, and the whole industry experienced those. This translated into Q2 into manufacturing closures, where manufacturing was not at the full level. And then now, this issue has morphed into being specifically for HPC/MCS, a customer acceptance issue. So all-in-all, what matters is that the revenue of fiscal year 2020 is actually the same if you factor into the equation the fact that we will reduce the backlog we generated and we saw elevated at the end of Q2, we'll turn that into revenue by the end of Q4 in full. Yes. The answer is yes, Toni. That is correct. We've taken pricing actions. And as Antonio said, in these situations, we've lived those before in 2018, as we raise prices, the margin expands, and the commodity costs take longer to normalize or to revert back into a position when margins are deteriorating. And so we do believe that at least in the short term, if the DRAM pressure continues, we will see margin expansion in Compute. Sure, Rod. Thanks for the question. So I'll say in Compute, units grew 36% quarter-on-quarter while AUP grew 3% quarter-on-quarter. I know you want the AUP on a year-over-year basis. I don't have that handy with you. I can follow-up and let you know what the answer is and the IR team will do that. And the second part of your question? And Rod, let me follow-up on the AUP questions on a year-over-year basis. On a year-over-year basis, units grew 3% and AUP was down 2%. That is the answer you were looking for. And on visibility, look, in simple terms, it's better than in Q2, and that's the reason why we provide guidance. If we didn't have a confidence, we wouldn't be providing guidance, if visibility were to be too low or too uncertain for us to do so. Thank you, Amit, for the question. So, yes, your observation is right. The gross margin went down 160 basis points, as highlighted in our announcement, and we more than made that at the OP margin level, with the OP margin at 7.1%. So what's driving that at the gross margin level is purely the mix. We had more Compute revenue at lower margin, it's a mix issue. We did also articulate the fact that if you normalize for backlog, we did have an impact on gross margins, both in Compute and Storage our gross margins would be up. But also, what you can see at OP margin is the fact that we are starting to take cost out and we are incurring restructuring costs as a result of this. I want to take the opportunity to remind everyone about our cost optimization and prioritization plan that we announced in Q2. We took proactive steps to strengthen our financial profile. I would tell you, I take a lot pride about this one, because we were present and we did it on time, being hit very hard in a full quarter of Q2 that was disrupted by COVID. And we are on track with that program to generate net annualized run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year 2022 relative to the fiscal year 2019 exit level and with most of those savings achieved at the end of fiscal year 2021. So hopefully, that should give you some comfort with respect to also the visibility point, and that's why we're saying, we expect gradual performance improvements going forward, knowing that we have taken actions with this core transformation program that is about prioritizing and reducing costs where we can find opportunities to do so."

I had the problem with my phone. So, thanks Sonalee. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. And I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating during the coronavirus-19 crisis. This pandemic is unlike any other crisis we faced. And it has brought significant economic disruption. Businesses and communities are struggling, supply chain productivity continues to be significantly constrained, and the demand environment is uneven. The market for capabilities like remote connectivity and virtual desktop solutions is stronger than pre-crisis in certain segments, and we are well-positioned in those areas. But overall, customers are understandably cautious, given so much uncertainty. These dynamics had a significant impact on our financial performance this quarter, given economic lockdowns since February. Our overall Q2 revenue declined by 15% to $6 billion, which led to a 42% decline in our non-GAAP operating profit. This was a tough quarter by every measure, and I'm of course disappointed in the results. But, I do not view our Q2 performance as a reflection of our capabilities nor of the opportunity ahead of us. Through this unsettling time, I have been really proud of our response that is aligned to our purpose to advance the way people live and work. We consider it our responsibility to help the world navigate this pandemic. We have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our team members and supporting our customers and partners as we weather the storm together. At the outset, we moved quickly to mobilize crisis management teams around the world. We took decisive steps to ensure our team members\u2019 safety and wellbeing. We closed all of our sites and rapidly moved team members to work-from-home except for those are performing mission critical roles. We expanded team members\u2019 benefits to cover coronavirus-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support, and provided tools and resources to keep people connected and productive. We also responded with important initiatives to address key needs created by the pandemic. We made substantial donations through HPE's foundation and designated $2 billion in financing through HPE Financial Services to help customers and partners with financial hardships. Our Aruba networking capabilities have been deployed in drive-up and virtual healthcare clinics and in schools that are facilitating distance learning. And our High Performance Computing solutions are helping scientists and leading research institutions to speed up drug discovery with complex modeling, simulation, AI and machine learning capabilities. We joined forces with the U.S. government and other high tech companies to form the White House High Performance Computing Consortium, giving coronavirus-19 researchers access to HPC resources. HPE also signed the Open COVID Pledge, granting free access to all of our patented technologies for the purpose of diagnosing, preventing and treating the virus. We have also adapted to deliver much needed capabilities and experiences to aid our customers\u2019 transformations as they navigate this difficult time. Through an improved sales coverage model aligned to market segments, our Intelligent Edge business continued to outperform the market while expanding operating margins and demonstrated 12% year-over-year growth in North America. In addition, we gained traction in our HPE GreenLake business. We continued to see acceleration in this very profitable strategic business and are seeing large deals come in, underscoring a growing interest in our as-a-service offerings. In fact, our annualized revenue run rate or ARR increased 17% to $520 million. While these are healthy signs of the needs that customers will continue to have coming out of the crisis, there continue to be significant supply constraints and delays in customer acceptance. This has impacted our ability to make deliveries to our customers. Across our portfolio, we exited Q2 with more than $1.5 billion in backlog in Compute, Storage, HPC and mission critical systems, as well as Aruba which represents two times the historical backlog. Our team is doing everything we can to deliver on these customer orders. Tarek will take you through our Q2 results in more detail. But before he does that, I want to take the time to align actions we will take to address the near term uncertainty and ensure HPE is well-positioned to emerge stronger, more agile and digitally enabled for a post-coronavirus-19 world. While the world is starting to envision what the recovery might look like, we need to be prepared for different scenarios. We know there is not going back to what used to be, there is only preparing for and building what comes next. We need to adapt in order to keep our strategic momentum even as the world has changed dramatically. We have taken a deliberate set of actions to protect our financial foundation, become a more agile organization and align our sources to critical core businesses in areas of growth that accelerate our edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service strategy. We continue to analyze financial forecasts and customer trends to better understand when and how global economies will recover. In the meantime, we have taken some immediate steps to reduce operating expenses that will protect our financial profile. Effective July 1st, we will implement a short-term pay reduction for all team members where it is legally permitted through October 31, 2020. My executive team and I will take the highest percentage of reduction. Beyond us, the amount of reduction will vary by level. For team members who live in countries where pay productions cannot be mandatory due to local laws and regulations, we are implementing unpaid leaves. In addition we have implemented cost containment measures across the Company, restricted external hirings through the end of our fiscal year and put salary increases on hold. Additionally, our Board of Directors have voluntary decided to forgo a percentage of its cash compensation for the remainder of the fiscal year 2020 to demonstrate its commitment to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, as we focus on preserving liquidity and improve our position to deliver for our customers now and in the future. In addition to those short-term measures, today we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan. This plan will help us focus our investments and realign our workforce to areas of growth that will accelerate our strategy. Some of the measures in the plan include continue to streamline our product portfolio, implement new digital customer engagement models and optimizing a workplace site strategy and experiences. HPE expects the plan would be implemented through fiscal year of 2022. And as a result of the changes to the Company's workforce, real estate model and for the business process improvements, we estimate gross savings of at least $1 billion and annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year 22 year end. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, HPE estimates cash funding payments between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next three years. Tarek will provide further details in his remarks. While we take the steps to secure our financial foundation and strengthen our operations, we have simplified our operating model and have aligned them to the financial segmentation we introduced early this year. Each of the HPE\u2019s businesses is critical to our go forward success. Each carries us an important part of the mission. And as our customers demand in new and different products and services from us, we must deliver. I\u2019m personally committed to delivering to help each of our businesses leverage its existing strengths and evolve. Each of our business groups now report directly to me. As part of the new organizational model, we created a GreenLake Cloud Services group to accelerate our other service capabilities. We also added a new software team that will architect our software strategy and portfolio that power our as-a-service platform. This new structure will provide fuller accountability and improve our execution and transformation. As the world emerges from the global pandemic, business continuity will depend on solutions that advance IT resiliency, empower remote workforces securely, extend connectivity, reinvigorate customer engagement and enable business model evolution. These realities mean that the digital transformation will be more critical than ever. This is why we must accelerate our strategy to deliver everything as-a-service edge to cloud. We see data growth in the cloud, on and off premises, and increasingly at the edge where we are uniquely positioned. The edge customers need persistent connectivity to bridge the digital and physical worlds. HPE Aruba Central is at the core of our edge strategy. It is the only cloud native simple to use and secure platform that unifies network management for wire, wireless and WAN networks, and soon 5G and Edge computing. In Q2, the number of unique customers using Aruba Central increased to 65,000. Customers will also continue to need capabilities to harness the power of their data, wherever it lives, at the edge, across public and private clouds, in colocations, or in the traditional data center. We continue to believe the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And as-a-service business models will expand the cloud experience everywhere for all apps and data. Early this month, we announced the general availability of HPE GreenLake Central, our advanced cloud native platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all their applications and data through an online operations console that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid cloud to estate. And in Q2, we made HPE container platform generally available, our new cloud native software defined stack is built using technologies from HPE\u2019s acquisition of BlueData, Storage in MapR and deliver greater flexibility and lower cost for Kubernetes deployment of cloud native and non-cloud native applications with persistent Storage connectivity. Next month, at our first ever Discover Virtual Experience, we will showcase how HPE will help organizations ensure seamless business continuity through new technology capabilities, greater business intelligence, and enhanced financial flexibility, joined by thousands of customers and partners who will discuss how we should think differently about transformation in the future, and will introduce new innovation to bring agility to customers\u2019 apps and data everywhere. There is a great promise in what we can accomplish when we increase the speed of innovation and continue to bring to market differentiated capabilities from edge-to-cloud. Our customers, partners and communities need what HPE can provide. Our ability to execute our strategic pivot to offering our entire portfolio as-a-service by 2022, while we continue to re-architect and strengthen our core businesses is critical. As we drive increased performance in our core businesses, we will be able to further align resources to new growth segments that will accelerate our strategy and pave the way to sustainable, profitable growth. One of our core beliefs at HPE is the power of Yes We Can. And I'm confident in our ability to execute because I believe we have the right strategy, the right leadership team and the right mindset to adapt and deliver in bold new ways. We are focused and we are making the necessary tradeoffs, so we can continue to invest in the future. We are undertaking it with a sense of urgency and conviction in our strategy. With that, let me turn into Tarek to review the quarter\u2019s results. Tarek?\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. Hope you can all hear me and are all safe and well. I\u2019ll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I've done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, please note since last quarter, we're now reporting results according to our new segmentation. Antonio discussed some of the key highlights of this quarter on slide one. Now, let me discuss our financial performance, starting slide two. Our Q2 results were heavily impacted by the global COVID-19 crisis. As Antonia mentioned, our Q2 represented a full quarter of operating under COVID-19. Our revenues of $6 billion were down 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by supply chain disruption, which resulted in significantly higher levels of backlog, particularly in Compute, HPC MCS and Storage. We also saw uneven demand with customers pushing out business activity as they navigated through the current economic crisis and lockdown. At the edge, the market for capabilities like remote cloud connectivity, and virtual desktop solutions was stronger than pre-crisis in certain segments. And we're well-positioned in those areas, offsetting the decline in campus switching that resulted from lower business activity. Despite the challenging backdrop, we managed to maintain relatively stable non-GAAP gross margins, which were down by 20 basis points year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating profit however was down 42% year-over-year to 6.1% in operating margin terms, and then our non-GAAP EPS of $0.22 was down 48% year-over-year. Our GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.64, primarily due to $865 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with legacy goodwill allocated to the HPC and MCS business segment, which impacted GAAP net EPS by $0.67. This impairment was not driven by the Cray business, which continues to perform consistent with our expectations. Cash flow from operations this quarter was $100 million, impacted by reduced profitability and inventory build-up. Free cash flow was negative $402 million compared to a positive $402 million for the prior year period, which was impacted by higher financing volumes. Taking all the previous into account, we're taking decisive and prudent actions to manage our costs and expenses, further improve our liquidity, and focus on opportunities to emerge stronger in the post-COVID-19 world. Turning to slide 3. Antonio outlined for you some of the near-term cost takeout measures we're implementing, including reductions in pay across our workforce, unpaid leave in places where pay reductions are not legally permitted, and hiring restrictions. He also mentioned the actions we\u2019re coming to today to further strengthen our financial profile in the medium and long term and accelerate our strategy. Today, we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company, ready to address the needs of our customers in a post-COVID-19 world. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth. More specifically, our plan is designed to right size our cost structure to the new normal, to allocate resources in alignment with our new segmentation and growth areas, to drive increased efficiencies through investments in digitization and automation, and finally, to accelerate our pivot to as-a-service to drive long-term sustainable, profitable growth. Overall, these new cost efficiencies will be captured from simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy and go-to-market, cost saving from supply chain optimization, increased penetration of remote customer support, new initiatives to leverage digital marketing and consolidating our real estate footprint. In terms of the timeline, we expect that the plan will be implemented through fiscal year 2022 and estimate that it will deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year \u201822 end. Having said that, we expect to achieve the majority of the savings by the end of fiscal year \u201821. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, we estimate cumulative cash funding payments of between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next three years. We'll now move to slide 4 that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. Let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we declined 2%. However, we saw over 12% year-over-year growth in North America, showing that the changes we made to our North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off, even in the midst of a challenging business environment while campus switching declined single digits due to increased emphasis on working from home, we grew the wireless LAN product business 7% year-over-year due to high demand for our remote access solutions and Wi-Fi 6 certified access points with 35% year-over-year growth in North America. Furthermore, we expanded gross margins and also grew operating margins by 570 basis points year-over-year to 11%. The bottom line is that we gained share in both campus switching and wireless LAN markets while significantly improving profit margins. In Compute, revenue declined 19% this quarter, driven by lower conversion rates, even as order backlog grew to 2 times our average historical backlog and lower unit growth, which was negative double digits this quarter. Our ability to fulfill orders was impacted by component shortages with supply chain logistics further disrupting our ability to fulfill demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the supply chain constraints alleviate, we expect to execute against our high backlog. In high-performance Compute and mission critical systems, revenue declined 18% primarily as a result of delayed installation and customer acceptance on account of COVID 19. Similar to Compute, this resulted in an elevated backlog, but we expect to see a stronger uptick in revenues in the second half of the year, as we execute against the order book. Our HPC business has been actively involved in COVID-related research activity and is providing COVID-19 researchers worldwide with access to the world's most powerful HPC resources to advance the pace of scientific discovery in the fight to stop the virus. Furthermore, we announced the 2023 delivery of the world's fastest exascale supercomputer, El Capitan for the United States Department of Energy at a record breaking speed of 2 exaflops, 10 times faster than today's most powerful supercomputer. Most importantly, the Cray integration remains on track to deliver the FY20 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by fiscal year \u201821. Within Storage, we declined 16% year-over-year due to higher backlog, similar to Compute, but had notable strength in big data, showing a growth of 61% year-over-year. Nimble Services revenues grew 20% year-over-year with services intensity at record highs as customers add high-margin value-added services. For operational services which is included across Compute, HPC, MCS and Storage, revenue declined by less than 1% year-over-year while orders were down 5% year-over-year, driven by the drop in Compute units. On the positive side, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold, continued to be strong with double-digit growth in Storage and HPC, MCS services driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continues to be robust. In advisory and professional services, revenue was down 8%, but we significantly improved operating margins by 6.2 points year-over-year due to our reentry in select countries combined with an increase in remote delivery of projects from 65% to 90%, which helped to control costs and drive an improvement in chargeability levels of staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume grew 10% year-over-year, despite the impact of COVID-19 and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again, this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 0.5%, which is best in class in this industry. We will obviously continue to closely monitor the impairment losses as liquidity constraints could affect some of our customers\u2019 ability to pay in upcoming quarters. We will tighten our underwriting guidelines as necessary to ensure we can manage through this crisis, and any impairment losses remain within our level of comfort. Our Communications & Media Solutions business that is included in our corporate investments segment is a strategically important business to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. CMS is showing improved momentum. We saw a strong double-digit softer order growth with EMEA growing 45% and Japan growing 70% this quarter. Revenue gained momentum growing 2% sequentially. We also expanded operating margins by 170 basis points year-over-year this quarter. We also recorded our first 5G core win with a Tier 1 carrier in the United States. This strategic win validates our 5G strategy with multi-vendor integration and true cloud native telco network solutions. Slide five shows our growing ARR profile I introduced at our securities analysts meeting in October 2019. I'm pleased to report that our Q2 \u201820 ARR came in at $520 million, representing 17% year-over-year growth and in line with our expectations. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue triple digits year-over-year this quarter. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as-a-service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as-a-service, we are reiterating our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from FY19 to FY22. Slide six highlights our EPS performance to-date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.22 in Q2 with headwinds from reduced operating leverage, suspension of our share buybacks and lower but expected contribution from OI&E. Consistent with our guidance at SAM, we expect OI&E to be approximately negative $100 million for fiscal year '20.  Turning to gross margin on slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 32% in Q2 of fiscal year '20 which was down 20% -- which was down, excuse me, 20 basis points year-over-year. Commodity costs were a tailwind to gross margin this quarter, even as the supply-demand volumes turned into a more inflationary commodities environment at the start of the quarter. Moving to slide 8. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.1% in Q2 of fiscal year '20 and non-GAAP operating income was down 42% year-over-year. This clearly demonstrates the imperative to right size our business to reflect the new revenue profile we are facing as a result of the COVID-19 impact. Turning to slide 9. Our cash flow from operations was $100 million, impacted by reduced profitability from the Compute and Storage businesses, which were heavily impacted this quarter and higher than normal working capital. Free cash flow was a use of $402 million for the quarter, driven by year-over-year growth which was impacted by financing volumes. Higher than normal backlog and resulting inventory build-up triggered a reduction in our cash conversion cycle from minus 17 days in the prior quarter to minus 5 days this quarter. We expect our cash conversion cycle to improve through the rest of the year as we execute against the backlog and supply chain constraints alleviate, both of which help us reduce our high inventory levels. Now, moving on to slide 10, I want to spend a moment on the strength of our balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, which is a competitive advantage in this environment. As of our April 30th, quarter end, we had approximately $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $2.25 billion in senior notes in April 2020 at a low cost of capital. We also have an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal. So, in total, we have approximately $10 million of liquidity. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in April 2020. Bottom-line, we have a strong cash position and ample credit available during these uncertain times to support and invest in our business. Let me recap for you our key takeaways for this quarter on slide 11. But before I do that, it's worth spending a couple of minutes on capital allocation. In Q2, we returned $305 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased $151 million in shares and paid a cash dividend of $154 million. In April 2020, we took the decision to suspend share buybacks in the light of the current environment where liquidity is of paramount importance. Subsequently, in April, we announced our regular dividend payment for Q3 \u201820, payable in July. Finally, let me summarize the key takeaway for you this quarter. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating under the COVID-19 crisis and we\u2019re heavily impacted by the crisis, both on the demand and supply side. As a result, we have enacted short-term actions and long-term cost optimization and prioritization plans to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company in a post-COVID world. Our robust balance sheet with approximately $10 billion of liquidity and investment grade credit rating gives us flexibility not only to weather the current storm, but to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth. Now, turning to outlook. Since the crisis began, we've been stress testing our model and running scenarios based on various assumptions, just like everybody else does. Given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the crisis and the rate and the shape of the recovery, there's a wide range of possible outcomes for the year. We have taken prudent and decisive steps with the latest being our cost optimization and prioritization plan, so that we are prepared for the different outcomes. Due to the uncertainty and consistent with our April 6, 2020 8-K filing where we withdrew our fiscal year 2020 financial guidance, we will not be providing any Q3 or fiscal year 2020 guidance. Now with that, let me hand over to Antonio and open it up for questions. Antonio?\nAntonio Neri: So, thank you, Tarek. And I know Nancy is going to operate this. So, Nancy, why we don\u2019t get started?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. The color on backlog is helpful, but I wonder whether you could also give some color on how orders trended through the fiscal second quarter, and what you've seen from an order perspective in the month of May. And then, just related to that, you specifically said that the HPC business and conversion rates would tick up in the second half, but you stopped short of giving a similar timeline for Compute and Storage. So, just any color as to when you think orders will begin to convert in those two segments as well.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Hi, Katy. Thanks for the question. So, the order intake or what I referred as the order linearity was fairly steady, I have to say. We normally plan a quarter in 13 weeks. The first week is the previous backlog from the previous quarter -- the backlog from the previous quarter and then 12 weeks. Right? And we plan the linearity early on. And I will say, we hit or exceeded our order linearity intake every week of the quarter. And so, these really came down to our ability to convert the order book into revenue. And in the case of HPC, High Performance Computing, let me remind everyone that in order for us to convert that order into revenue, we have to build it, obviously, we have to ship it, but we have to install it and we have to turn it on. And once the customer accepts that installation, which in many cases is fairly large installations, you're talking about number of clusters, that's when only we can recognize revenue. And so, the impact on HPC was two-fold, was not being able to go to customer sites because customers were locked down like we are and not being able to install and deliver and turn it on. And obviously, the same challenge we have in Compute and Storage with supply chain constraints and capacity because of social distances, and obviously, in the components level that we saw obviously a major disruption. And as a reminder, we ship pretty much three servers every minute. So, when that supply chain stops, it\u2019s pretty significant. So, in terms of going forward, our priority one, two, and three continues to be clear the backlog, and that's how I think about it. Throughout Q2, we made progress in the recovery. I\u2019ll say China is pretty much back to normal, but obviously they are clean in the backlog themselves. Because they had to first recover the labor and then obviously, they depend also on sub-suppliers for the components, think about cables, connectors, transistors, you name it. And so, for us, the majority backlog right now is in the bucket. And then, in the regional factories, for the vast majority, all are performing at capacity except one or two, where, the rules and the regulations or the shelter-in-place are demanding that there is a stringent process on social distancing, which obviously impact the capacity in the factory lines, but the factories are all up and running. So, I am optimistic about the weeks to come. So, I take this a week at a time. Obviously, we continue to focus on the order intake, I cannot comment in May because we think you asked the question on May, because we're in Q3 right now. But in Q2, the order linearity was fairly steady. And we expect, not just HPC but Compute and Storage to continue to make progress. And that's why Q3 will be different than Q2.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Antonio, you commented on rightsizing the cost structure to a new normal. A few years ago, HPE Next was supposed to be the last restructuring program. And I know no one could have anticipated COVID-19. But, is it your view that you will not get back to pre-COVID levels because of secular end-market challenges, or is there a different interpretation to that?\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. Great question. So, since you mentioned HPE Next, let me start with that. I mean, I was the architect of HPE Next in the 2017 year. As you know, we launched it in the fall of 2017. And I will say HPE Next was a great success story, because it allowed us to re-architect the Company in the key areas in terms of simplification of processes, streamlining our go-to-market model. Remember, we went from a worldwide geo to country to more a geo model, where we removed layers. And honestly, it allowed us to reinvest back in innovation. And that's where I announced the investment of $4 billion at the edge. And now, we start seeing the results of that, with great numbers, despite the challenges. So, that was a success. And remember, we committed to deliver a $800 million in net savings and which we did and we did ahead of schedule. Now, to your point, this is a crisis unlike anyone we have faced. And I will say, in 2017, I said, listen, we don't envision another cost optimization plan, but this is a cost optimization driven by the pandemic. But honestly, I see an opportunity to go faster in our pivot to our strategy, which is to offer everything as-a-service. It is very unfortunate that we have this pandemic just causing tremendous economic disruption and obviously a huge impact to communities. But, from a business perspective, we are more [convinced] [ph] than ever in our strategy. And we see it. The demand for pervasive ubiquity connectivity. That's why access points are very strong for us. All cloud -- the cloud experience deployed everywhere from the edge to cloud and the ability to consumer as-a-service. And this is where we see tremendous momentum with HPE GreenLake. So, for me, it\u2019s right size our cost structure to the new normal. And we don't know exactly what the new normal is at this point in time, because we don't know what recovery looks like. It's about allocating resources for the areas of growth we see in the future and also increase efficiency because we learn a lot. Remember, in Q1, I talked about it. We learned quite a lot and we extended the HPE Next, which is now part of this cost optimization and prioritization plan, and digitize everything. I believe this will cause incredible structural impact in a way people are going to work. And my expectation is at least 50% of our employees will never come back to an office. And the office will look completely different, which means our offices will be more center of innovation and collaboration, not where you come to do your regular work every day. And that requires resizing our real estate footprint. But even, as you resize the footprint, also requires new experiences and therefore investment associated with that. But, when you bring it all together and the need to rescale and upscale and allocate resources in the right place, I believe we have an opportunity to accelerate the strategy and drive to that long-term sustainable, profitable growth.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Antonio. And the negative operating leverage on Compute was quite significant in the quarter. How much of that would you say was a supply-driven issue versus demand-driven issue? And how do you think investors should think about the trajectory of that, given that you also have the significant cost actions starting to kick in? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. It definitely was a supply chain-driven, although demand continued to be uneven, as we discussed before, particularly in Compute. And I will say -- you have to look at it this way. The shortfall on the revenue is pretty much all supply chain-driven. Because I made the comment early on that our linearity in the order intake was pretty steady. But, in the order linearity, you have to look at the customer segments. Obviously, when you sell to, I call it cloud companies, which are more software companies that deliver their value through the cloud, those are continuing to be steady. If you think about enterprise, I will say those were pretty steady. SMB obviously was the biggest challenge in the transactional business. Because fundamentally, that segment of the market was significantly disruptive. As I think about the future, right, obviously, we already were under a macro situation. But, let's remind ourselves that the Compute platform go through an innovation cycle themselves, even though it's commoditized. And as I think about the Gen10, if you remember the Gen10, we actually told everyone that we said that two thirds of the structural change was permanent because of the ability to attach richer configuration. As we go to what we call Gen10.5 and Gen11, which is happening in the next 18 months, you're going to see more in that. You're going to see, again the same cycle where the density of these products, the amount of memory and storage, you can put inside this Compute platform will continue to increase. And that's good for us because obviously it drives AUP. But right now, our focus is really around, clear the backlog, both on the Compute side and on the HPC side, both finish installation and obviously clear the backlog there as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi: I have two questions as well. First, it sounds like you're saying there was really a de minimis impact from coronavirus on demand and this was largely supply chain driven. And if you have the supply and you kept backlog at normal levels, you would have done $700 million more in revenue in Q2. And it sounds like if production is up and running, if you are able to bring down your backlog to normal levels, such should boost Q3 revenues $700 million relative to normal seasonality. So, am I thinking about that correctly? And how much progress do you think you can make on bringing your backlog down to normal levels over the course of Q3? And then, I have a follow-up.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Toni. Hope all is well. Yes. I think, you're thinking in the right parameters. The only thing I will say is that definitely the vast majority was supply chain. And as I said in my early comment in the previous question, there was some demand obviously, but particularly in SMB and some elements of the mid market where enterprise was a little more steady. And we saw uptick in demand for example, that consumes Compute for example solutions like VDI, which was in high demand or even big data storage, which at the end, Toni is a Compute platform with a level of hard disk attached to it or SSDs attached to it. So, in that context, you are asking absolutely the right question, and this is what I\u2019m maniacally focused with the team and which as I said, my priority one, two and three is clear the backlog. And as I said earlier, we focus the quarter in 13 weeks, where we enter the backlog, which was the $1.5 billion on May 1st and where we're going to exit on July 31st as the new orders come in. Because fundamentally, we expect the orders to come in. And we have an linearity plan associated with that recovery. So, I feel pretty optimistic about it. But however, it's going to come down to our ability to get the supply in the right place and the ability to execute in the cycle times that we need. And obviously, as you know, we have a very global diversified supply chain, and we have made some series of moves to move products built around the globe, even if they are for other regions. So, we can accelerate that backlog. And so, this is going to be the name of the game. But generally, as I think about the last four weeks, and I think about the next four weeks and then the next four weeks after that, we continue to see progress. But, there's a lot of things, who knows, there is a restart of coronavirus. I'm more concerned right now, Toni, to be honest with you, if something happened in one of these locations where we have the factory and you go into resheltering of the social distancing, that could have an impact. In terms of the velocity behind with components from China, I will say that\u2019s where the vast majority is going absolutely in the right direction. And obviously, the logistics side, as we reopen countries and flights across the globe, that will help as well.\nToni Sacconaghi: Okay. Thank you for that. Maybe you could -- I mean, is it unrealistic to think you could close, you could get backlog to normal levels? And then, my second question is, if you're really saying that this was largely the supply, not demand disruption, I'm still a little -- I'm having difficulty reconciling the new -- sort of HPE Next too, because on your Q4 call, you were pretty unequivocal there wouldn't be another HPE Next. You felt you were in the right place on cost. You said last quarter, you were doing a little bit more on cost, but it wasn't structural, it wasn\u2019t another HPE Next. And now, you are undertaking a significant multiyear structural change. And A, that doesn't feel consistent with the statement that this was really a supply issue; and B, it makes me wonder like, are you more worried about your competitive position, or are you worried that the IT environment is going to be weaker for a while?\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Toni. So, my remarks about what happened in Q2 was about the supply chain and lesser so on the demand. I cannot forecast right now what the demand is on the back end. And this is where in our remarks we said we are looking at the pipeline, we're looking at the economic indicators, which obviously all of you provide, and others. And so, I will not make any further comment because on the demand in -- I don\u2019t know in October or November, I don't know what that will look like. But, I'm just replying to your question about what happened in Q2 definitely was based on the order intake we had. It was -- the vast majority was the supply chain problem. And there were pockets of uneven demand, which obviously were accentuated in SMB space, which was quite significant. But remember, we serve global customers, we serve large enterprise, mid-market and SMB, and in that a lower vertical. So, we have to look at this from multiple perspectives. But definitely in Q2 was -- the vast majority was a definitely a supply chain, and in that demand, we saw pockets of growth, despite the dynamic of the coronavirus, which Aruba definitely was -- despite the 2% decline year-over-year, we saw bright spots in wireless LAN up 7%, North America, the geo 12%, the remote access points we couldn't ship enough of it. I mean, we didn't have all of it. VDI was another one. So, I think that was Q2. As I think about Q3, it\u2019s all about cleaning the backlog. And in a reasonable way, I feel more confident in Q3 and obviously in the results in Q2 because we should expect continuous improvement. As for the demand, I don't know what to tell you, Toni right now, because obviously it depends also in the global recovery of the economy. And then, ultimately, customers are going to assess where they want to spend their money, but right now, that's where we are. And then, in terms of HPE Next, I made that comment at the beginning of HPE Next. Now, let's be clear. I mean, nobody expected the coronavirus 19. But as I said in one of my comments, I think to Katy's question -- actually, Wamsi\u2019s question was, I believe this is -- in a downturn, this is where you go double down your strategy. And this is where investing in the right place now. So, when the recovery takes place, you come out on the other end stronger. And so, that's fundamentally what we're doing is really obviously addressing the cost resizing for the situation we are in. And in the short term, we have taken some painful action. For me, as a CEO, telling our employees we're going to cut salaries, not an easy thing to do. I don't take that lightly. But in the other end, allocating the right people, the right resources, the right investment into the future, now that we're in the downturn is the biggest opportunity. Because I think the strategy is absolutely spot on. And I'm more convicted than ever. Thanks, Toni. Okay. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my questions. My first one is, I realize you're not giving guidance, but can you provide some parameters for us to consider thinking about OpEx, how much is variable, how material do you think the salary reductions will be relative to sort of the overall base run-rate of OpEx? And, is there a significant amount of revenue that\u2019s sort of just sitting out there waiting to be recognized as soon as customers come back and can be trained and can accept? And I don't know maybe something about backlog in terms of your confidence level that you're not going to lose those orders to competitors or that they are pretty firm orders? Just anything you can kind of give us to have some idea of how to think about it? Was this the trough quarter for instance? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. Let me start, and then, I will ask Tarek talk about more the first part of your question. Obviously, again, it goes back to Toni's question, the confidence to clear the backlog. And this is where again we are focusing. I feel better about it than six weeks ago. But, as I said earlier, right, we're taking it day by day, week by week. It looks promising. And we continue to make progress every day, every week. In terms of what is the size of revenue? I cannot give you a right now, but I will tell you, remember, HPC deals are normally multimillion dollar deals, sometimes mid-double-digit deals. And those are all waiting to be deployed and installed. And they are all over the world. And so, obviously, we have a fantastic services organization ready to go as soon as the customer let us in. So, those are the things you need to think about it. But, I hope everybody appreciates, we\u2019ve given you complete direction of what was the backlog and what we are doing about it.  I think, I'm going to give it back to Tarek to talk about the first part of the question. So, Tarek?\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you, Antonio. It's quite difficult to call the bottom or trough quarter, given the level of uncertainty that is currently visible. There's one thing that we know is that the uncertainty is high. And it's everyone's guess what the shape of the recovery will be. So, please bear that in mind. And most people and economists we talk to and spend a lot of time talking to many experts, as I'm sure you did, are not thinking in terms of a V-shape recovery, more in terms of a U-shape recovery. And that's what we are modeling. And this is why we have come up with the cost prioritization plan that Antonio mentioned. And as he said, we need to take every day as it comes. So, in terms of cost take out, there is -- as part of our plan, the goal is to achieve the vast majority of the $800 million net run rate savings by fiscal year \u201821, although we said this number will be visible by fiscal year \u201822. And the reason why we said this is because of this level of uncertainty that exists in the shape of the economic recovery that I was referring to you before. So what we are doing is we\u2019re supplementing run rate reductions with temporary pay cuts and actions that we can take otherwise to protect the financial profile of the company and enhance our liquidity moving forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeriel Ong from Deutsche Bank.\nJeriel Ong: Thanks for letting me ask a question. And, I guess, first of all, I\u2019d like to ask a little about GreenLake. Obviously, it was nice that the business still grew, year-on-year. But I'm wondering why you\u2019re confident in an acceleration in that growth. It seems like as the business gets bigger, it'd be hard seeing growth rate, but it seems like you're kind of back ending more of that growth to get to that 30% to 40% compound annual growth rate.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. Thank you, Jeriel. I think, we have a unique differentiated value proposition with the HPE GreenLake. And with the introduction of the HPE GreenLake Central, which is a true cloud native platform where you can deploy the right mix from edge to cloud and consumer as-a-service and deliver the workload optimized solutions in a standardized way, it is a true differentiation for us. And what we have seen in the last several months is a continuous growth in a pipeline and the ability to convert the pipeline into larger deals, larger deals. Some of these deal, in particular two or three, which are triple digits, to give a sense. And so, for us -- and also, they are multiyear, right? So, for us, that's an exciting, because remember, we said many times, when we sign a GreenLake deal, we work with a customer in a multiyear deal. And the pull-through for infrastructure that goes with it and services attached is higher. The services attached through Pointnext operational service is 100% by the way, attach. And the margins are higher. So, fundamentally, we are confident in reaffirming the annualized run rate revenue of 30% to 40% that Tarek talked earlier, because it's a function of getting these continuous momentum and larger deals for many large cap companies. So, I think that's what we feel. And now, we are tailored more for the mid-market as well for SMB. And what the customers are looking for is the ability to scale up and down based on their needs, and also more and more have someone else run it for them. They don't want to be in the run side, they want to be more in the innovation side.\nJeriel Ong: I appreciate that. And just one more for me. I think, I get a sense from the cash spend for the realignment that fiscal year \u201821 is going to be -- seems like the bulk of the spending. But, I guess, I'd like to get an idea for whether it's going to be cost of goods sold or OpEx-driven, if it is going to represent the general mix on your costs generally, or if it's going to be weighted one way or another. Thanks.\nAntonio Neri: I'm going to give that to Tarek.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. Thank you, Antonio. With respect to cash and cash flow and I'd like also to ask you a question for clarification purposes. With respect to cash flow, what has driven our cash flow performance in Q2, is the increase in inventory levels and the change in the cash conversion cycle. We've stocked up a lot of inventory. And the backlog is also a reflection of the fact that we stocked up a lot of inventory. And our cash flow conversion cycle, which was a favorable minus 17 days, dropped to less favorable minus five days because of our stocking up in inventory terms. Could you please, for my benefit, repeat your question on costs and what you were trying to get to here? I did not quite understand it. Thank you.\nJeriel Ong: Yes. So, in terms of your annualized net run rate savings, what areas of your business are those going to come from?\nTarek Robbiati: Okay. So, by and large, we're going to leave no stone unturned. That's the message. But, effectively, if you look at what the plan is about, it\u2019s fundamentally around realigning resources to the segments that we started to report back in the first quarter and areas of growth that we see driving better productivity levels across those segments, changing fundamentally the way we engage with customers from a marketing and sales standpoint, rethinking our supply chain to create it in such a way that is more resilient than before, yet agile and efficient, rethinking also our workforce management practices. Because quite frankly, I don't know what your situation is like, but we've been working very effectively from home for the past three months almost. And so, this is pointing to us the need to think about this new normal and what does it mean from a workforce management standpoint, and our real estate footprint. So, you can rethink your real estate footprint now that the world is much more distributed and connected than ever before. So, I hope I have provided sufficient color to answer your question. Back to you, Antonio.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Antonio. Next question? I know, we got into the top of the hour where we are 5 minutes over. Do we have any more questions on the line operator?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nJake Wilhelm: Hi. This is Jake on for Aaron. I was wondering if you could go into a little bit about how we should think about portfolio simplification in regard to the cost optimization plan.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. So, obviously, from the portfolio optimization, I think about the work we have done under HPE Next and continue that work to streamline number of platforms and options, we have done a phenomenal job there. But to Tarek\u2019s point, it\u2019s all about where we build these products and fundamentally, where we also design these products. So, there is an opportunity to continue to drive that optimization. And fundamentally, I think about our portfolio as a way to accelerate that as-a-service model. Obviously, on one end, at the edge, we have a fantastic cloud platform called HP Aruba that we continue to invest -- Aruba Central, that we continue to invest and it\u2019s this 100% software, right, with access points and switching that comes with it, think that way, and obviously through the subscription model. The other thing is, obviously in the core business is how we drive the best workload optimized solutions that they are fully automated and provision from the cloud using HPE GreenLake Central. So, that's another component of that. So, that's how we think about it. And obviously, there is a lot of the work we do even in the core businesses. While people may think it\u2019s hardware -- and I want to give an example. The recent introduction of a distributed hyperconverged infrastructure is actually all software. It's 100% software in many ways. And as I think about the future, how the world will evolve, we're going to live in a more distributed model. Today, it's very centralized in the sense you have your mobile phone or your mobile device connected to some sort of cloud, that cloud can be your datacenter, can be somebody else's cloud. But fundamentally, the cloud experience will extend -- will be extended all the way to the edge. And that's why we have plan in that portfolio to continue to invest in the Aruba Central with integration of 5G and the integration of edge computers. So, it's a combination of freeing up resources in the traditional businesses, reallocate those resources in those areas that will drive the long-term sustainable, profitable growth, based on the work we have done in HPE Next and also continue to digitize everything we have and we can. Okay. So, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. My sense is, is that the quarter you just reported was primarily supply and the uncertainty you're expressing about the outlook maybe reflects more of a shift towards demand. So, I thought it would be helpful, if you could give us a better understanding of what your customer verticals typically look like? In other words, how much is federal government, how much is the SMB market, how much is Financial Services? Because I think even if we can\u2019t make predictions, I think all of us have some sense of which verticals are healthier than others. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. Thanks, Simon. I think, I will say -- let me start with the bad. SMB obviously has been a significant challenge, we all witness every day. That's what has driven a big chunk of the unemployment that we see here in the United States. So, obviously, that will take time to recover. And generally, that market gets served through what we call a transactional engine, and it\u2019s a high velocity engine. In the enterprise, if you take it by vertical, I think telco has been fairly steady. Tarek talked about a portfolio that we have called Communications & Media Solutions. You heard some of the numbers, in some areas growing 40% and 70%. It's all software and services, and obviously drags infrastructure because eventually has to virtualize, whatever infrastructure put there. Financial Services actually was fairly steady and strong. We have a very large footprint. And this is where the diversification of our geo and verticals actually is helping us a little bit. Generally, FSI and telco are very large for us, where retail not so much, and I think retail obviously was more impacted. But I will say, telco or communications, media and entertainment, Financial Services was strong. Obviously, oil and gas not so much, because we know the pricing of the oil. And then, as I think about transportation, obviously impacted as well. But, I will say the number of deals and the size of the deals were generally the same. The elongated sales cycles were consistent. But we align our plans based on the linearity I talked earlier. And Q2 was fairly steady so far. So, whether the first half was supply chain and the second half is demand is to be seen. Again, Tarek talked early on about the shape of the recovery. And I agree with Tarek, I totally subscribe to the U recovery. The question is how far the two sides of the U are and how deep the U is. But right now, it feels steady in those areas. And as I said earlier, our focus is the backlog. Okay. Next question? I think, this is the last -- one more question. I think, this is the last question. I think we have another question on the line.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI.\nIrvin Liu: Thanks. Hi. This is Irvin Liu dialing in for Amit. As I look at your cost optimization and prioritization plan that was announced today, that will result in a $1 billion to $1.3 billion total cash payment through fiscal 2022. Now, is it fair to say that the cost savings plan will essentially push back the timing related to the achievement of your normalized free cash flow target of $2 billion by let's say another two to three years?\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'm going to pass it to Tarek.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you, Antonio. So, the most important thing in our costs optimization and privatization plan is to achieve those $800 million of net run rate savings and hold them as long as possible in the cost structure, so that we can effectively see more margins in our business. With respect to free flow last year, if it were not for a legal settlement that we paid, we would have exceeded $2 billion free cash flow Mark. So, that was what that business was capable back then with a certain revenue base. And, what you've heard from Antonio is that we are rightsizing the business to what is potentially a new revenue base. And it's too early to tell whether that new revenue base will come back to the pre-pandemic revenue levels, moving forward. But, what's very important right now is our focus is to ensure that we right size our business and deliver those run rate savings, so that we can emerge stronger after this crisis subsides. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Tarek. And again, I just want to -- last year was a unique year in the sense that we were pretty much on track. And actually, I would argue, we delivered the normalized free cash flow because we were able to take care of unique circumstances with the settlement in arbitration. So, when you add it all up, it was in excess of $2 billion. And again, it comes down to our ability to drive the operating cash, the cash from operations which general tends to be very strong. Obviously, this quarter, because we couldn't convert, we couldn't deliver that. But, let me remind again that the cost optimization and prioritization is not just about resizing, but it's about shifting investments to the strategy, which I answered earlier to Toni, I think is the opportunity we have now and therefore, making that happen in the lower part of this, whatever the lower is, is the right strategy, so you become stronger on the other end. So, to wrap it up, thanks again for joining us today and for your questions. Let me make a few comments to wrap the call. As I said earlier, these are unprecedented and challenging times for all of us, not just the business, but obviously the economy and the communities. Technology and digital transformation, in my view, are more critical than ever, to enable what I think is going to be new world, the new distributed world where workforces would be located in different ways. And honestly, there will be new ways to run businesses. I think, our strategy to deliver a cloud experience from the edge to the cloud is more relevant than ever. And at the core of that is to securely connect people and things as we see more than 50 million devices being connected to the network every single day. But, at the same time, we need to analyze data faster and to accelerate the business outcomes for our customers. I think, the measure we announced today will allow us to protect not only our balance sheet and continue to preserve the liquidity, which as you saw, in one of the slides, we have a very robust balance sheet with capacity up to $10 billion. So, that's not the issue. But fundamentally, my goal is to adapt the organization to be more agile, to align our resources to the critical core business areas of growth, and ultimately to accelerate the strategy, which I'm very convicted which will result in a long-term sustainable, profitable growth. And I want you to take away that this work is being done with sense of urgency. Whether we are the first to announce it than other people, doesn't matter, we believe that this is the right thing to do, and the time is important. So, again, thank you for joining us, the call today. And I hope you stay safe with you and your family. And we'll talk soon. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today and you may now disconnect. Thank you.",

            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Thanks, Sonalee. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is safe and healthy. [Technical Difficulty] Yes. Thank you. Sorry. I had the problem with my phone. So, thanks Sonalee. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. And I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating during the coronavirus-19 crisis. This pandemic is unlike any other crisis we faced. And it has brought significant economic disruption. Businesses and communities are struggling, supply chain productivity continues to be significantly constrained, and the demand environment is uneven. The market for capabilities like remote connectivity and virtual desktop solutions is stronger than pre-crisis in certain segments, and we are well-positioned in those areas. But overall, customers are understandably cautious, given so much uncertainty. These dynamics had a significant impact on our financial performance this quarter, given economic lockdowns since February. Our overall Q2 revenue declined by 15% to $6 billion, which led to a 42% decline in our non-GAAP operating profit. This was a tough quarter by every measure, and I'm of course disappointed in the results. But, I do not view our Q2 performance as a reflection of our capabilities nor of the opportunity ahead of us. Through this unsettling time, I have been really proud of our response that is aligned to our purpose to advance the way people live and work. We consider it our responsibility to help the world navigate this pandemic. We have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our team members and supporting our customers and partners as we weather the storm together. At the outset, we moved quickly to mobilize crisis management teams around the world. We took decisive steps to ensure our team members' safety and wellbeing. We closed all of our sites and rapidly moved team members to work-from-home except for those are performing mission critical roles. We expanded team members' benefits to cover coronavirus-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support, and provided tools and resources to keep people connected and productive. We also responded with important initiatives to address key needs created by the pandemic. We made substantial donations through HPE's foundation and designated $2 billion in financing through HPE Financial Services to help customers and partners with financial hardships. Our Aruba networking capabilities have been deployed in drive-up and virtual healthcare clinics and in schools that are facilitating distance learning. And our High Performance Computing solutions are helping scientists and leading research institutions to speed up drug discovery with complex modeling, simulation, AI and machine learning capabilities. We joined forces with the U.S. government and other high tech companies to form the White House High Performance Computing Consortium, giving coronavirus-19 researchers access to HPC resources. HPE also signed the Open COVID Pledge, granting free access to all of our patented technologies for the purpose of diagnosing, preventing and treating the virus. We have also adapted to deliver much needed capabilities and experiences to aid our customers' transformations as they navigate this difficult time. Through an improved sales coverage model aligned to market segments, our Intelligent Edge business continued to outperform the market while expanding operating margins and demonstrated 12% year-over-year growth in North America. In addition, we gained traction in our HPE GreenLake business. We continued to see acceleration in this very profitable strategic business and are seeing large deals come in, underscoring a growing interest in our as-a-service offerings. In fact, our annualized revenue run rate or ARR increased 17% to $520 million. While these are healthy signs of the needs that customers will continue to have coming out of the crisis, there continue to be significant supply constraints and delays in customer acceptance. This has impacted our ability to make deliveries to our customers. Across our portfolio, we exited Q2 with more than $1.5 billion in backlog in Compute, Storage, HPC and mission critical systems, as well as Aruba which represents two times the historical backlog. Our team is doing everything we can to deliver on these customer orders. Tarek will take you through our Q2 results in more detail. But before he does that, I want to take the time to align actions we will take to address the near term uncertainty and ensure HPE is well-positioned to emerge stronger, more agile and digitally enabled for a post-coronavirus-19 world. While the world is starting to envision what the recovery might look like, we need to be prepared for different scenarios. We know there is not going back to what used to be, there is only preparing for and building what comes next. We need to adapt in order to keep our strategic momentum even as the world has changed dramatically. We have taken a deliberate set of actions to protect our financial foundation, become a more agile organization and align our sources to critical core businesses in areas of growth that accelerate our edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service strategy. We continue to analyze financial forecasts and customer trends to better understand when and how global economies will recover. In the meantime, we have taken some immediate steps to reduce operating expenses that will protect our financial profile. Effective July 1st, we will implement a short-term pay reduction for all team members where it is legally permitted through October 31, 2020. My executive team and I will take the highest percentage of reduction. Beyond us, the amount of reduction will vary by level. For team members who live in countries where pay productions cannot be mandatory due to local laws and regulations, we are implementing unpaid leaves. In addition we have implemented cost containment measures across the Company, restricted external hirings through the end of our fiscal year and put salary increases on hold. Additionally, our Board of Directors have voluntary decided to forgo a percentage of its cash compensation for the remainder of the fiscal year 2020 to demonstrate its commitment to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, as we focus on preserving liquidity and improve our position to deliver for our customers now and in the future. In addition to those short-term measures, today we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan. This plan will help us focus our investments and realign our workforce to areas of growth that will accelerate our strategy. Some of the measures in the plan include continue to streamline our product portfolio, implement new digital customer engagement models and optimizing a workplace site strategy and experiences. HPE expects the plan would be implemented through fiscal year of 2022. And as a result of the changes to the Company's workforce, real estate model and for the business process improvements, we estimate gross savings of at least $1 billion and annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year 22 year end. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, HPE estimates cash funding payments between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next three years. Tarek will provide further details in his remarks. While we take the steps to secure our financial foundation and strengthen our operations, we have simplified our operating model and have aligned them to the financial segmentation we introduced early this year. Each of the HPE's businesses is critical to our go forward success. Each carries us an important part of the mission. And as our customers demand in new and different products and services from us, we must deliver. I'm personally committed to delivering to help each of our businesses leverage its existing strengths and evolve. Each of our business groups now report directly to me. As part of the new organizational model, we created a GreenLake Cloud Services group to accelerate our other service capabilities. We also added a new software team that will architect our software strategy and portfolio that power our as-a-service platform. This new structure will provide fuller accountability and improve our execution and transformation. As the world emerges from the global pandemic, business continuity will depend on solutions that advance IT resiliency, empower remote workforces securely, extend connectivity, reinvigorate customer engagement and enable business model evolution. These realities mean that the digital transformation will be more critical than ever. This is why we must accelerate our strategy to deliver everything as-a-service edge to cloud. We see data growth in the cloud, on and off premises, and increasingly at the edge where we are uniquely positioned. The edge customers need persistent connectivity to bridge the digital and physical worlds. HPE Aruba Central is at the core of our edge strategy. It is the only cloud native simple to use and secure platform that unifies network management for wire, wireless and WAN networks, and soon 5G and Edge computing. In Q2, the number of unique customers using Aruba Central increased to 65,000. Customers will also continue to need capabilities to harness the power of their data, wherever it lives, at the edge, across public and private clouds, in colocations, or in the traditional data center. We continue to believe the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And as-a-service business models will expand the cloud experience everywhere for all apps and data. Early this month, we announced the general availability of HPE GreenLake Central, our advanced cloud native platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all their applications and data through an online operations console that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid cloud to estate. And in Q2, we made HPE container platform generally available, our new cloud native software defined stack is built using technologies from HPE's acquisition of BlueData, Storage in MapR and deliver greater flexibility and lower cost for Kubernetes deployment of cloud native and non-cloud native applications with persistent Storage connectivity. Next month, at our first ever Discover Virtual Experience, we will showcase how HPE will help organizations ensure seamless business continuity through new technology capabilities, greater business intelligence, and enhanced financial flexibility, joined by thousands of customers and partners who will discuss how we should think differently about transformation in the future, and will introduce new innovation to bring agility to customers' apps and data everywhere. There is a great promise in what we can accomplish when we increase the speed of innovation and continue to bring to market differentiated capabilities from edge-to-cloud. Our customers, partners and communities need what HPE can provide. Our ability to execute our strategic pivot to offering our entire portfolio as-a-service by 2022, while we continue to re-architect and strengthen our core businesses is critical. As we drive increased performance in our core businesses, we will be able to further align resources to new growth segments that will accelerate our strategy and pave the way to sustainable, profitable growth. One of our core beliefs at HPE is the power of Yes We Can. And I'm confident in our ability to execute because I believe we have the right strategy, the right leadership team and the right mindset to adapt and deliver in bold new ways. We are focused and we are making the necessary tradeoffs, so we can continue to invest in the future. We are undertaking it with a sense of urgency and conviction in our strategy. With that, let me turn into Tarek to review the quarter's results. Tarek? So, thank you, Tarek. And I know Nancy is going to operate this. So, Nancy, why we don't get started? Yes. Hi, Katy. Thanks for the question. So, the order intake or what I referred as the order linearity was fairly steady, I have to say. We normally plan a quarter in 13 weeks. The first week is the previous backlog from the previous quarter -- the backlog from the previous quarter and then 12 weeks. Right? And we plan the linearity early on. And I will say, we hit or exceeded our order linearity intake every week of the quarter. And so, these really came down to our ability to convert the order book into revenue. And in the case of HPC, High Performance Computing, let me remind everyone that in order for us to convert that order into revenue, we have to build it, obviously, we have to ship it, but we have to install it and we have to turn it on. And once the customer accepts that installation, which in many cases is fairly large installations, you're talking about number of clusters, that's when only we can recognize revenue. And so, the impact on HPC was two-fold, was not being able to go to customer sites because customers were locked down like we are and not being able to install and deliver and turn it on. And obviously, the same challenge we have in Compute and Storage with supply chain constraints and capacity because of social distances, and obviously, in the components level that we saw obviously a major disruption. And as a reminder, we ship pretty much three servers every minute. So, when that supply chain stops, it's pretty significant. So, in terms of going forward, our priority one, two, and three continues to be clear the backlog, and that's how I think about it. Throughout Q2, we made progress in the recovery. I'll say China is pretty much back to normal, but obviously they are clean in the backlog themselves. Because they had to first recover the labor and then obviously, they depend also on sub-suppliers for the components, think about cables, connectors, transistors, you name it. And so, for us, the majority backlog right now is in the bucket. And then, in the regional factories, for the vast majority, all are performing at capacity except one or two, where, the rules and the regulations or the shelter-in-place are demanding that there is a stringent process on social distancing, which obviously impact the capacity in the factory lines, but the factories are all up and running. So, I am optimistic about the weeks to come. So, I take this a week at a time. Obviously, we continue to focus on the order intake, I cannot comment in May because we think you asked the question on May, because we're in Q3 right now. But in Q2, the order linearity was fairly steady. And we expect, not just HPC but Compute and Storage to continue to make progress. And that's why Q3 will be different than Q2. Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. Great question. So, since you mentioned HPE Next, let me start with that. I mean, I was the architect of HPE Next in the 2017 year. As you know, we launched it in the fall of 2017. And I will say HPE Next was a great success story, because it allowed us to re-architect the Company in the key areas in terms of simplification of processes, streamlining our go-to-market model. Remember, we went from a worldwide geo to country to more a geo model, where we removed layers. And honestly, it allowed us to reinvest back in innovation. And that's where I announced the investment of $4 billion at the edge. And now, we start seeing the results of that, with great numbers, despite the challenges. So, that was a success. And remember, we committed to deliver a $800 million in net savings and which we did and we did ahead of schedule. Now, to your point, this is a crisis unlike anyone we have faced. And I will say, in 2017, I said, listen, we don't envision another cost optimization plan, but this is a cost optimization driven by the pandemic. But honestly, I see an opportunity to go faster in our pivot to our strategy, which is to offer everything as-a-service. It is very unfortunate that we have this pandemic just causing tremendous economic disruption and obviously a huge impact to communities. But, from a business perspective, we are more [convinced] [ph] than ever in our strategy. And we see it. The demand for pervasive ubiquity connectivity. That's why access points are very strong for us. All cloud -- the cloud experience deployed everywhere from the edge to cloud and the ability to consumer as-a-service. And this is where we see tremendous momentum with HPE GreenLake. So, for me, it's right size our cost structure to the new normal. And we don't know exactly what the new normal is at this point in time, because we don't know what recovery looks like. It's about allocating resources for the areas of growth we see in the future and also increase efficiency because we learn a lot. Remember, in Q1, I talked about it. We learned quite a lot and we extended the HPE Next, which is now part of this cost optimization and prioritization plan, and digitize everything. I believe this will cause incredible structural impact in a way people are going to work. And my expectation is at least 50% of our employees will never come back to an office. And the office will look completely different, which means our offices will be more center of innovation and collaboration, not where you come to do your regular work every day. And that requires resizing our real estate footprint. But even, as you resize the footprint, also requires new experiences and therefore investment associated with that. But, when you bring it all together and the need to rescale and upscale and allocate resources in the right place, I believe we have an opportunity to accelerate the strategy and drive to that long-term sustainable, profitable growth. Sure. It definitely was a supply chain-driven, although demand continued to be uneven, as we discussed before, particularly in Compute. And I will say -- you have to look at it this way. The shortfall on the revenue is pretty much all supply chain-driven. Because I made the comment early on that our linearity in the order intake was pretty steady. But, in the order linearity, you have to look at the customer segments. Obviously, when you sell to, I call it cloud companies, which are more software companies that deliver their value through the cloud, those are continuing to be steady. If you think about enterprise, I will say those were pretty steady. SMB obviously was the biggest challenge in the transactional business. Because fundamentally, that segment of the market was significantly disruptive. As I think about the future, right, obviously, we already were under a macro situation. But, let's remind ourselves that the Compute platform go through an innovation cycle themselves, even though it's commoditized. And as I think about the Gen10, if you remember the Gen10, we actually told everyone that we said that two thirds of the structural change was permanent because of the ability to attach richer configuration. As we go to what we call Gen10.5 and Gen11, which is happening in the next 18 months, you're going to see more in that. You're going to see, again the same cycle where the density of these products, the amount of memory and storage, you can put inside this Compute platform will continue to increase. And that's good for us because obviously it drives AUP. But right now, our focus is really around, clear the backlog, both on the Compute side and on the HPC side, both finish installation and obviously clear the backlog there as well. Yes. Thanks, Toni. Hope all is well. Yes. I think, you're thinking in the right parameters. The only thing I will say is that definitely the vast majority was supply chain. And as I said in my early comment in the previous question, there was some demand obviously, but particularly in SMB and some elements of the mid market where enterprise was a little more steady. And we saw uptick in demand for example, that consumes Compute for example solutions like VDI, which was in high demand or even big data storage, which at the end, Toni is a Compute platform with a level of hard disk attached to it or SSDs attached to it. So, in that context, you are asking absolutely the right question, and this is what I'm maniacally focused with the team and which as I said, my priority one, two and three is clear the backlog. And as I said earlier, we focus the quarter in 13 weeks, where we enter the backlog, which was the $1.5 billion on May 1st and where we're going to exit on July 31st as the new orders come in. Because fundamentally, we expect the orders to come in. And we have an linearity plan associated with that recovery. So, I feel pretty optimistic about it. But however, it's going to come down to our ability to get the supply in the right place and the ability to execute in the cycle times that we need. And obviously, as you know, we have a very global diversified supply chain, and we have made some series of moves to move products built around the globe, even if they are for other regions. So, we can accelerate that backlog. And so, this is going to be the name of the game. But generally, as I think about the last four weeks, and I think about the next four weeks and then the next four weeks after that, we continue to see progress. But, there's a lot of things, who knows, there is a restart of coronavirus. I'm more concerned right now, Toni, to be honest with you, if something happened in one of these locations where we have the factory and you go into resheltering of the social distancing, that could have an impact. In terms of the velocity behind with components from China, I will say that's where the vast majority is going absolutely in the right direction. And obviously, the logistics side, as we reopen countries and flights across the globe, that will help as well. Yes. Thanks, Toni. So, my remarks about what happened in Q2 was about the supply chain and lesser so on the demand. I cannot forecast right now what the demand is on the back end. And this is where in our remarks we said we are looking at the pipeline, we're looking at the economic indicators, which obviously all of you provide, and others. And so, I will not make any further comment because on the demand in -- I don't know in October or November, I don't know what that will look like. But, I'm just replying to your question about what happened in Q2 definitely was based on the order intake we had. It was -- the vast majority was the supply chain problem. And there were pockets of uneven demand, which obviously were accentuated in SMB space, which was quite significant. But remember, we serve global customers, we serve large enterprise, mid-market and SMB, and in that a lower vertical. So, we have to look at this from multiple perspectives. But definitely in Q2 was -- the vast majority was a definitely a supply chain, and in that demand, we saw pockets of growth, despite the dynamic of the coronavirus, which Aruba definitely was -- despite the 2% decline year-over-year, we saw bright spots in wireless LAN up 7%, North America, the geo 12%, the remote access points we couldn't ship enough of it. I mean, we didn't have all of it. VDI was another one. So, I think that was Q2. As I think about Q3, it's all about cleaning the backlog. And in a reasonable way, I feel more confident in Q3 and obviously in the results in Q2 because we should expect continuous improvement. As for the demand, I don't know what to tell you, Toni right now, because obviously it depends also in the global recovery of the economy. And then, ultimately, customers are going to assess where they want to spend their money, but right now, that's where we are. And then, in terms of HPE Next, I made that comment at the beginning of HPE Next. Now, let's be clear. I mean, nobody expected the coronavirus 19. But as I said in one of my comments, I think to Katy's question -- actually, Wamsi's question was, I believe this is -- in a downturn, this is where you go double down your strategy. And this is where investing in the right place now. So, when the recovery takes place, you come out on the other end stronger. And so, that's fundamentally what we're doing is really obviously addressing the cost resizing for the situation we are in. And in the short term, we have taken some painful action. For me, as a CEO, telling our employees we're going to cut salaries, not an easy thing to do. I don't take that lightly. But in the other end, allocating the right people, the right resources, the right investment into the future, now that we're in the downturn is the biggest opportunity. Because I think the strategy is absolutely spot on. And I'm more convicted than ever. Thanks, Toni. Okay. Operator, next question? Sure. Let me start, and then, I will ask Tarek talk about more the first part of your question. Obviously, again, it goes back to Toni's question, the confidence to clear the backlog. And this is where again we are focusing. I feel better about it than six weeks ago. But, as I said earlier, right, we're taking it day by day, week by week. It looks promising. And we continue to make progress every day, every week. In terms of what is the size of revenue? I cannot give you a right now, but I will tell you, remember, HPC deals are normally multimillion dollar deals, sometimes mid-double-digit deals. And those are all waiting to be deployed and installed. And they are all over the world. And so, obviously, we have a fantastic services organization ready to go as soon as the customer let us in. So, those are the things you need to think about it. But, I hope everybody appreciates, we've given you complete direction of what was the backlog and what we are doing about it.  I think, I'm going to give it back to Tarek to talk about the first part of the question. So, Tarek? Sure. Thank you, Jeriel. I think, we have a unique differentiated value proposition with the HPE GreenLake. And with the introduction of the HPE GreenLake Central, which is a true cloud native platform where you can deploy the right mix from edge to cloud and consumer as-a-service and deliver the workload optimized solutions in a standardized way, it is a true differentiation for us. And what we have seen in the last several months is a continuous growth in a pipeline and the ability to convert the pipeline into larger deals, larger deals. Some of these deal, in particular two or three, which are triple digits, to give a sense. And so, for us -- and also, they are multiyear, right? So, for us, that's an exciting, because remember, we said many times, when we sign a GreenLake deal, we work with a customer in a multiyear deal. And the pull-through for infrastructure that goes with it and services attached is higher. The services attached through Pointnext operational service is 100% by the way, attach. And the margins are higher. So, fundamentally, we are confident in reaffirming the annualized run rate revenue of 30% to 40% that Tarek talked earlier, because it's a function of getting these continuous momentum and larger deals for many large cap companies. So, I think that's what we feel. And now, we are tailored more for the mid-market as well for SMB. And what the customers are looking for is the ability to scale up and down based on their needs, and also more and more have someone else run it for them. They don't want to be in the run side, they want to be more in the innovation side. I'm going to give that to Tarek. Yes. Thanks, Antonio. Next question? I know, we got into the top of the hour where we are 5 minutes over. Do we have any more questions on the line operator? Yes. So, obviously, from the portfolio optimization, I think about the work we have done under HPE Next and continue that work to streamline number of platforms and options, we have done a phenomenal job there. But to Tarek's point, it's all about where we build these products and fundamentally, where we also design these products. So, there is an opportunity to continue to drive that optimization. And fundamentally, I think about our portfolio as a way to accelerate that as-a-service model. Obviously, on one end, at the edge, we have a fantastic cloud platform called HP Aruba that we continue to invest -- Aruba Central, that we continue to invest and it's this 100% software, right, with access points and switching that comes with it, think that way, and obviously through the subscription model. The other thing is, obviously in the core business is how we drive the best workload optimized solutions that they are fully automated and provision from the cloud using HPE GreenLake Central. So, that's another component of that. So, that's how we think about it. And obviously, there is a lot of the work we do even in the core businesses. While people may think it's hardware -- and I want to give an example. The recent introduction of a distributed hyperconverged infrastructure is actually all software. It's 100% software in many ways. And as I think about the future, how the world will evolve, we're going to live in a more distributed model. Today, it's very centralized in the sense you have your mobile phone or your mobile device connected to some sort of cloud, that cloud can be your datacenter, can be somebody else's cloud. But fundamentally, the cloud experience will extend -- will be extended all the way to the edge. And that's why we have plan in that portfolio to continue to invest in the Aruba Central with integration of 5G and the integration of edge computers. So, it's a combination of freeing up resources in the traditional businesses, reallocate those resources in those areas that will drive the long-term sustainable, profitable growth, based on the work we have done in HPE Next and also continue to digitize everything we have and we can. Okay. So, next question, please? Sure. Thanks, Simon. I think, I will say -- let me start with the bad. SMB obviously has been a significant challenge, we all witness every day. That's what has driven a big chunk of the unemployment that we see here in the United States. So, obviously, that will take time to recover. And generally, that market gets served through what we call a transactional engine, and it's a high velocity engine. In the enterprise, if you take it by vertical, I think telco has been fairly steady. Tarek talked about a portfolio that we have called Communications & Media Solutions. You heard some of the numbers, in some areas growing 40% and 70%. It's all software and services, and obviously drags infrastructure because eventually has to virtualize, whatever infrastructure put there. Financial Services actually was fairly steady and strong. We have a very large footprint. And this is where the diversification of our geo and verticals actually is helping us a little bit. Generally, FSI and telco are very large for us, where retail not so much, and I think retail obviously was more impacted. But I will say, telco or communications, media and entertainment, Financial Services was strong. Obviously, oil and gas not so much, because we know the pricing of the oil. And then, as I think about transportation, obviously impacted as well. But, I will say the number of deals and the size of the deals were generally the same. The elongated sales cycles were consistent. But we align our plans based on the linearity I talked earlier. And Q2 was fairly steady so far. So, whether the first half was supply chain and the second half is demand is to be seen. Again, Tarek talked early on about the shape of the recovery. And I agree with Tarek, I totally subscribe to the U recovery. The question is how far the two sides of the U are and how deep the U is. But right now, it feels steady in those areas. And as I said earlier, our focus is the backlog. Okay. Next question? I think, this is the last -- one more question. I think, this is the last question. I think we have another question on the line. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'm going to pass it to Tarek. Yes. Thanks, Tarek. And again, I just want to -- last year was a unique year in the sense that we were pretty much on track. And actually, I would argue, we delivered the normalized free cash flow because we were able to take care of unique circumstances with the settlement in arbitration. So, when you add it all up, it was in excess of $2 billion. And again, it comes down to our ability to drive the operating cash, the cash from operations which general tends to be very strong. Obviously, this quarter, because we couldn't convert, we couldn't deliver that. But, let me remind again that the cost optimization and prioritization is not just about resizing, but it's about shifting investments to the strategy, which I answered earlier to Toni, I think is the opportunity we have now and therefore, making that happen in the lower part of this, whatever the lower is, is the right strategy, so you become stronger on the other end. So, to wrap it up, thanks again for joining us today and for your questions. Let me make a few comments to wrap the call. As I said earlier, these are unprecedented and challenging times for all of us, not just the business, but obviously the economy and the communities. Technology and digital transformation, in my view, are more critical than ever, to enable what I think is going to be new world, the new distributed world where workforces would be located in different ways. And honestly, there will be new ways to run businesses. I think, our strategy to deliver a cloud experience from the edge to the cloud is more relevant than ever. And at the core of that is to securely connect people and things as we see more than 50 million devices being connected to the network every single day. But, at the same time, we need to analyze data faster and to accelerate the business outcomes for our customers. I think, the measure we announced today will allow us to protect not only our balance sheet and continue to preserve the liquidity, which as you saw, in one of the slides, we have a very robust balance sheet with capacity up to $10 billion. So, that's not the issue. But fundamentally, my goal is to adapt the organization to be more agile, to align our resources to the critical core business areas of growth, and ultimately to accelerate the strategy, which I'm very convicted which will result in a long-term sustainable, profitable growth. And I want you to take away that this work is being done with sense of urgency. Whether we are the first to announce it than other people, doesn't matter, we believe that this is the right thing to do, and the time is important. So, again, thank you for joining us, the call today. And I hope you stay safe with you and your family. And we'll talk soon. Take care."

            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. Hope you can all hear me and are all safe and well. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I've done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, please note since last quarter, we're now reporting results according to our new segmentation. Antonio discussed some of the key highlights of this quarter on slide one. Now, let me discuss our financial performance, starting slide two. Our Q2 results were heavily impacted by the global COVID-19 crisis. As Antonia mentioned, our Q2 represented a full quarter of operating under COVID-19. Our revenues of $6 billion were down 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by supply chain disruption, which resulted in significantly higher levels of backlog, particularly in Compute, HPC MCS and Storage. We also saw uneven demand with customers pushing out business activity as they navigated through the current economic crisis and lockdown. At the edge, the market for capabilities like remote cloud connectivity, and virtual desktop solutions was stronger than pre-crisis in certain segments. And we're well-positioned in those areas, offsetting the decline in campus switching that resulted from lower business activity. Despite the challenging backdrop, we managed to maintain relatively stable non-GAAP gross margins, which were down by 20 basis points year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating profit however was down 42% year-over-year to 6.1% in operating margin terms, and then our non-GAAP EPS of $0.22 was down 48% year-over-year. Our GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.64, primarily due to $865 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with legacy goodwill allocated to the HPC and MCS business segment, which impacted GAAP net EPS by $0.67. This impairment was not driven by the Cray business, which continues to perform consistent with our expectations. Cash flow from operations this quarter was $100 million, impacted by reduced profitability and inventory build-up. Free cash flow was negative $402 million compared to a positive $402 million for the prior year period, which was impacted by higher financing volumes. Taking all the previous into account, we're taking decisive and prudent actions to manage our costs and expenses, further improve our liquidity, and focus on opportunities to emerge stronger in the post-COVID-19 world. Turning to slide 3. Antonio outlined for you some of the near-term cost takeout measures we're implementing, including reductions in pay across our workforce, unpaid leave in places where pay reductions are not legally permitted, and hiring restrictions. He also mentioned the actions we're coming to today to further strengthen our financial profile in the medium and long term and accelerate our strategy. Today, we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company, ready to address the needs of our customers in a post-COVID-19 world. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth. More specifically, our plan is designed to right size our cost structure to the new normal, to allocate resources in alignment with our new segmentation and growth areas, to drive increased efficiencies through investments in digitization and automation, and finally, to accelerate our pivot to as-a-service to drive long-term sustainable, profitable growth. Overall, these new cost efficiencies will be captured from simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy and go-to-market, cost saving from supply chain optimization, increased penetration of remote customer support, new initiatives to leverage digital marketing and consolidating our real estate footprint. In terms of the timeline, we expect that the plan will be implemented through fiscal year 2022 and estimate that it will deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year \u201822 end. Having said that, we expect to achieve the majority of the savings by the end of fiscal year \u201821. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, we estimate cumulative cash funding payments of between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next three years. We'll now move to slide 4 that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. Let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we declined 2%. However, we saw over 12% year-over-year growth in North America, showing that the changes we made to our North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off, even in the midst of a challenging business environment while campus switching declined single digits due to increased emphasis on working from home, we grew the wireless LAN product business 7% year-over-year due to high demand for our remote access solutions and Wi-Fi 6 certified access points with 35% year-over-year growth in North America. Furthermore, we expanded gross margins and also grew operating margins by 570 basis points year-over-year to 11%. The bottom line is that we gained share in both campus switching and wireless LAN markets while significantly improving profit margins. In Compute, revenue declined 19% this quarter, driven by lower conversion rates, even as order backlog grew to 2 times our average historical backlog and lower unit growth, which was negative double digits this quarter. Our ability to fulfill orders was impacted by component shortages with supply chain logistics further disrupting our ability to fulfill demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the supply chain constraints alleviate, we expect to execute against our high backlog. In high-performance Compute and mission critical systems, revenue declined 18% primarily as a result of delayed installation and customer acceptance on account of COVID 19. Similar to Compute, this resulted in an elevated backlog, but we expect to see a stronger uptick in revenues in the second half of the year, as we execute against the order book. Our HPC business has been actively involved in COVID-related research activity and is providing COVID-19 researchers worldwide with access to the world's most powerful HPC resources to advance the pace of scientific discovery in the fight to stop the virus. Furthermore, we announced the 2023 delivery of the world's fastest exascale supercomputer, El Capitan for the United States Department of Energy at a record breaking speed of 2 exaflops, 10 times faster than today's most powerful supercomputer. Most importantly, the Cray integration remains on track to deliver the FY20 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by fiscal year \u201821. Within Storage, we declined 16% year-over-year due to higher backlog, similar to Compute, but had notable strength in big data, showing a growth of 61% year-over-year. Nimble Services revenues grew 20% year-over-year with services intensity at record highs as customers add high-margin value-added services. For operational services which is included across Compute, HPC, MCS and Storage, revenue declined by less than 1% year-over-year while orders were down 5% year-over-year, driven by the drop in Compute units. On the positive side, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold, continued to be strong with double-digit growth in Storage and HPC, MCS services driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continues to be robust. In advisory and professional services, revenue was down 8%, but we significantly improved operating margins by 6.2 points year-over-year due to our reentry in select countries combined with an increase in remote delivery of projects from 65% to 90%, which helped to control costs and drive an improvement in chargeability levels of staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume grew 10% year-over-year, despite the impact of COVID-19 and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again, this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 0.5%, which is best in class in this industry. We will obviously continue to closely monitor the impairment losses as liquidity constraints could affect some of our customers' ability to pay in upcoming quarters. We will tighten our underwriting guidelines as necessary to ensure we can manage through this crisis, and any impairment losses remain within our level of comfort. Our Communications & Media Solutions business that is included in our corporate investments segment is a strategically important business to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. CMS is showing improved momentum. We saw a strong double-digit softer order growth with EMEA growing 45% and Japan growing 70% this quarter. Revenue gained momentum growing 2% sequentially. We also expanded operating margins by 170 basis points year-over-year this quarter. We also recorded our first 5G core win with a Tier 1 carrier in the United States. This strategic win validates our 5G strategy with multi-vendor integration and true cloud native telco network solutions. Slide five shows our growing ARR profile I introduced at our securities analysts meeting in October 2019. I'm pleased to report that our Q2 \u201820 ARR came in at $520 million, representing 17% year-over-year growth and in line with our expectations. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue triple digits year-over-year this quarter. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as-a-service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as-a-service, we are reiterating our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from FY19 to FY22. Slide six highlights our EPS performance to-date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.22 in Q2 with headwinds from reduced operating leverage, suspension of our share buybacks and lower but expected contribution from OI&E. Consistent with our guidance at SAM, we expect OI&E to be approximately negative $100 million for fiscal year '20.  Turning to gross margin on slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 32% in Q2 of fiscal year '20 which was down 20% -- which was down, excuse me, 20 basis points year-over-year. Commodity costs were a tailwind to gross margin this quarter, even as the supply-demand volumes turned into a more inflationary commodities environment at the start of the quarter. Moving to slide 8. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.1% in Q2 of fiscal year '20 and non-GAAP operating income was down 42% year-over-year. This clearly demonstrates the imperative to right size our business to reflect the new revenue profile we are facing as a result of the COVID-19 impact. Turning to slide 9. Our cash flow from operations was $100 million, impacted by reduced profitability from the Compute and Storage businesses, which were heavily impacted this quarter and higher than normal working capital. Free cash flow was a use of $402 million for the quarter, driven by year-over-year growth which was impacted by financing volumes. Higher than normal backlog and resulting inventory build-up triggered a reduction in our cash conversion cycle from minus 17 days in the prior quarter to minus 5 days this quarter. We expect our cash conversion cycle to improve through the rest of the year as we execute against the backlog and supply chain constraints alleviate, both of which help us reduce our high inventory levels. Now, moving on to slide 10, I want to spend a moment on the strength of our balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, which is a competitive advantage in this environment. As of our April 30th, quarter end, we had approximately $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $2.25 billion in senior notes in April 2020 at a low cost of capital. We also have an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal. So, in total, we have approximately $10 million of liquidity. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in April 2020. Bottom-line, we have a strong cash position and ample credit available during these uncertain times to support and invest in our business. Let me recap for you our key takeaways for this quarter on slide 11. But before I do that, it's worth spending a couple of minutes on capital allocation. In Q2, we returned $305 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased $151 million in shares and paid a cash dividend of $154 million. In April 2020, we took the decision to suspend share buybacks in the light of the current environment where liquidity is of paramount importance. Subsequently, in April, we announced our regular dividend payment for Q3 \u201820, payable in July. Finally, let me summarize the key takeaway for you this quarter. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating under the COVID-19 crisis and we're heavily impacted by the crisis, both on the demand and supply side. As a result, we have enacted short-term actions and long-term cost optimization and prioritization plans to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company in a post-COVID world. Our robust balance sheet with approximately $10 billion of liquidity and investment grade credit rating gives us flexibility not only to weather the current storm, but to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth. Now, turning to outlook. Since the crisis began, we've been stress testing our model and running scenarios based on various assumptions, just like everybody else does. Given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the crisis and the rate and the shape of the recovery, there's a wide range of possible outcomes for the year. We have taken prudent and decisive steps with the latest being our cost optimization and prioritization plan, so that we are prepared for the different outcomes. Due to the uncertainty and consistent with our April 6, 2020 8-K filing where we withdrew our fiscal year 2020 financial guidance, we will not be providing any Q3 or fiscal year 2020 guidance. Now with that, let me hand over to Antonio and open it up for questions. Antonio? Thank you, Antonio. It's quite difficult to call the bottom or trough quarter, given the level of uncertainty that is currently visible. There's one thing that we know is that the uncertainty is high. And it's everyone's guess what the shape of the recovery will be. So, please bear that in mind. And most people and economists we talk to and spend a lot of time talking to many experts, as I'm sure you did, are not thinking in terms of a V-shape recovery, more in terms of a U-shape recovery. And that's what we are modeling. And this is why we have come up with the cost prioritization plan that Antonio mentioned. And as he said, we need to take every day as it comes. So, in terms of cost take out, there is -- as part of our plan, the goal is to achieve the vast majority of the $800 million net run rate savings by fiscal year \u201821, although we said this number will be visible by fiscal year \u201822. And the reason why we said this is because of this level of uncertainty that exists in the shape of the economic recovery that I was referring to you before. So what we are doing is we're supplementing run rate reductions with temporary pay cuts and actions that we can take otherwise to protect the financial profile of the company and enhance our liquidity moving forward. Yes. Thank you, Antonio. With respect to cash and cash flow and I'd like also to ask you a question for clarification purposes. With respect to cash flow, what has driven our cash flow performance in Q2, is the increase in inventory levels and the change in the cash conversion cycle. We've stocked up a lot of inventory. And the backlog is also a reflection of the fact that we stocked up a lot of inventory. And our cash flow conversion cycle, which was a favorable minus 17 days, dropped to less favorable minus five days because of our stocking up in inventory terms. Could you please, for my benefit, repeat your question on costs and what you were trying to get to here? I did not quite understand it. Thank you. Okay. So, by and large, we're going to leave no stone unturned. That's the message. But, effectively, if you look at what the plan is about, it's fundamentally around realigning resources to the segments that we started to report back in the first quarter and areas of growth that we see driving better productivity levels across those segments, changing fundamentally the way we engage with customers from a marketing and sales standpoint, rethinking our supply chain to create it in such a way that is more resilient than before, yet agile and efficient, rethinking also our workforce management practices. Because quite frankly, I don't know what your situation is like, but we've been working very effectively from home for the past three months almost. And so, this is pointing to us the need to think about this new normal and what does it mean from a workforce management standpoint, and our real estate footprint. So, you can rethink your real estate footprint now that the world is much more distributed and connected than ever before. So, I hope I have provided sufficient color to answer your question. Back to you, Antonio. Thank you, Antonio. So, the most important thing in our costs optimization and privatization plan is to achieve those $800 million of net run rate savings and hold them as long as possible in the cost structure, so that we can effectively see more margins in our business. With respect to free flow last year, if it were not for a legal settlement that we paid, we would have exceeded $2 billion free cash flow Mark. So, that was what that business was capable back then with a certain revenue base. And, what you've heard from Antonio is that we are rightsizing the business to what is potentially a new revenue base. And it's too early to tell whether that new revenue base will come back to the pre-pandemic revenue levels, moving forward. But, what's very important right now is our focus is to ensure that we right size our business and deliver those run rate savings, so that we can emerge stronger after this crisis subsides. Thank you."

HPE\u2019s first quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our strategic priorities to shift our company to higher margin and more recurring revenues against a dynamic market backdrop. I am disappointed that our overall revenue is $6.9 billion, reflects a 7% decline for the quarter, primarily due to declines in our compute business. However, I am pleased with the results in several key areas of our business aligned to our strategy. Our pivot to as-a-service is gaining momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate grew 19% year-over-year. We started reporting this new metric last quarter to provide more transparency into the recurring and higher margin benefits of shifting to our as-a-service model. We grew HPE GreenLake services\u2019 orders 48% year-over-year. HPE GreenLake gained 65 new logos in Q1 and has surpassed 800 total customers. We returned to growth in our Intelligent Edge business with revenue up 4% year-over-year and we continue to see profitable growth in areas of investment including High Performance Compute, Hyperconverged Infrastructure, Big Data Storage and Operational Services orders with continued improvements in our services attach intensity. Our Q1 revenues were impacted by a number of factors. First, like many of our peers, we continue to see uneven and unpredictable demand due to macro uncertainty. This has resulted in longer sales cycles and delayed customer decisions. Second, commodity supply constraints disrupted our ability to meet our customer's demand this quarter, particularly in our compute and high performance compute businesses. Additionally, the outbreak of the coronavirus at the end of January impacted component manufacturing resulting in higher quarter and backlogs. In both of these cases, we have established specific mitigation and recovering plans with each of our suppliers. Finally, we encountered a challenge in consolidating a manufacturing site in North America. We have a plan in place to address the Q1 issue and are confident that our efforts will result in increased efficiency and agility as we move forward. It is important to note that even with the revenue shortfall, we improved our non-GAAP gross margin by 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2%. We drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44, up 5% year-over-year and inline with our outlook, while also invest in for future innovation. And we delivered improved free cash flow compared to last year's level and in line with Q1 normal seasonality. While market uncertainty continues and new global developments like the coronavirus have emerged, we have taken the right actions to mitigate against these evolving dynamics. Some of these actions includes further cost account in our backend operations as a part of our HPE Next program, which has been a key enabler of our gross and operating margin improvement. We had extended the program through fiscal year 2021 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. As Tarek will cover in more detail because of the actions we have taken to address the uncertainty and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time. We are comfortable maintaining our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP EPS outlook, but there are too many unknowns at this point to provide second quarter guidance. Also, we do feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year 2023 cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Given that we expect some impact on cash conversion cycles driven by the ongoing recovery from supply constraints and the impact of the coronavirus. These are the right pragmatic actions to take and I am confident in our ability to deliver in our strategy. Our customers continue to reaffirm their need for hybrid capabilities to advise their digital transformations and harness the power of their data, whatever it lives in the cloud, on and off premises and increasingly at the edge. As the edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service company, HPE is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends and help our customers to transform. Before Tarek provides more specifics about the quarter, let me highlight a few of our business and segment results. First, our Intelligent Edge business outperformed competitors across the industry. We grew in all geographies posting double-digit growth in North America despite the challenging macro environment and we delivered double-digit growth in our Aruba branded products. Over the last two quarters, we have been actively enhancing our sales coverage model in North America and I am proud of the team hard work and our momentum. We declared the opportunity at the Intelligent Edge early and we continue to invest in bringing in a cloud experience to the Edge where data is increasingly created. At the core of the strategy is HPE Aruba Central, the only cloud native and simple to use platform that unifies network management, AI-power insights and IoT device security for wire, wireless and WAN networks and soon 5G and edge computing. More than 58,000 unique customers are using Aruba Central. In Q1, Aruba, which pioneered the software-defined branch solution for deployment and management of large retail networks further enhance our solution by integrating Aruba branch gateways with Aruba Central by providing a single point of control for SD1 wire and wireless networking. Aruba can help customers achieve secure simplified brunch connectivity at scale. Our customers continue to recognize our innovation at the edge. For instance, in the first quarter, the office of information technology at Princeton University turned to ArubaOS-CX to support its wire initiative and seamlessly integrate with Aruba wireless with a goal of creating a complete Mobile-First Campus of the future. Sub-Zero a leading looks to the appliance maker updated its wired with wireless infrastructure through ArubaOS-CX and Instant wireless to support IoT in high-end appliances. Both our ArubaOS-CX and Wi-Fi 6 solutions continue to gain traction in the market. The customer examples I share are a testament of our differentiated innovation. I am excited about how our market leadership is helping customers to redefine experiences at the edge. We will continue to enhance our portfolio with integration of 5G and mobile edge computing to capitalize on this significant opportunity. Turning to Hybrid IT, as we announced at our Securities Analyst Meeting last fall, we are providing revenue and operating profit disclosures in four business segments: Compute, High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, Storage, and Advisory and Profession Services aligned to customer demands and market trends. Tarek will walk you through the financial results in greater detail and let me share a few high level observations. As I noted earlier, our compute revenue was impacted by a combination of factors and came in lower than anticipated for the quarter. However, we did see an acceleration in unit volumes, which were up mid single digits year-over-year, excluding Tier 1 in China. Our High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems segment includes the first full quarter of Cray. We are excited about the combination of HPE and Cray and the growing time. We have been awarded more than $2 billion in HPC business expected to be delivered in the next three years. Programs include the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s El Capitan System at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Frontier supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory among others. Our new segmentation provide greater insights in through the size, strength and attractive financial profile of our HPE Storage business, which is $5 billion business with an operating margin of 18%. We gained momentum in key areas during the quarter and expect to gain share in external disk. Big Data storage grew 45% year-over-year and demonstrates early success with our MapR acquisition. Hyperconverged Infrastructure also continued to grow up 6%. HPE InfoSight, our cloud-based AI operations platform gained momentum across both storage and compute. I am proud of our focused efforts and innovation that have created one of the most comprehensive intelligent data platform in the industry, which will continue to provide customers with superior simplicity and performance. Our Advisory & Professional Services business provides strategy, technology planning and consultant services that help customers navigate their digital transformation from edge to cloud. With the increased focus and simplification of this business, we draw demand across the HPE portfolio and significantly expanded operating margins this quarter, up 12.5 points year-over-year. Our customer wins demonstrate the strength of our strategy and breadth of our portfolio. For example, HPE was recently selected by Zenuity, a joint venture between Volvo Cars and Veoneer to help make next generation autonomous driving cars reality. HPE will provide the crucial AI and High Performance Compute and required to gather, store, organize and analyze data from its global network test vehicles and software development centers. The end to end solution will be delivered as-a-service through HPE GreenLake. [Indiscernible] a global electronics company wanted to reduce storage complexity and reclaim claim management time. Already relying on three parts for business critical applications, the company chose nimble storage to help manage that 20% year-over-year growth in data. This new combination has improved performance threefold. Volkswagen Group selected HPE to deliver state-of-the-art Compute & Mission Critical servers to run its apps and solutions like SAP HANA, virtual desktop infrastructure and others focused on Big Data Analytics, AI and autonomous driving. Our offerings such as HPE Superdome Flex, HPE ProLiant Gen10 servers and HPE Pointnext support services will power the data and apps for the Volkswagen Group\u2019s 12 global brands. In Q1, we continue to accelerate innovation. We achieved a major milestone in our pivot to as-a-service with the launch of HPE GreenLake central platform. HPE GreenLake central is an advanced cloud platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all the application and data wherever they live through an operational console that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid estate. We launched our HPE Container Platform, which is the first enterprise grade Kubernetes-based container solution. It leverages HPE\u2019s acquisition of BlueData and MapR together with 100% open-source Kubernetes software. This platform provides customers with a common and faster path to run legacy and cloud-native applications with persistence/storage connectivity. And we acquired Scytale, an innovative software company focused on service authentication. The Scytale team are the founding contributors to two open-source projects that they are positioned to become the de facto standards for identifying and securing enterprise workloads both on and off premises. Our Scytale acquisition is consistent with our targeted approach to M&A that brings critical talent and complementary technologies to HPE. We look for accretive value enhancing acquisitions that improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our strategy. Finally, our HPE Financial Services business continues to provide us with the critical competitive advantage. In Q1, overall financing volume increased 2%. GreenLake represented more than 40% of our HPE leasing volume. HPEFS uses multiple leavers to help customers accelerated digital transformations while contributing to the circular economy. Through asset upcycling and accelerated migration HPEFS free up well over $500 million in our customers' budgets over the last two years. This business help our customers capture value from older assets, achieve their sustainability goals, and invest in new technologies as-a-service. As we advance our business objectives to meet our customer needs and deliver for our shareholders, we continue to be guided by very strong purpose. I am tremendously proud of our environmental stewardship, our investments in our people and our culture of integrity and inclusion. HPE was just recognized as one of the Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute. We were also proud to be named to Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. These are very important measures of how HPE delivers for our team members, customers, shareholders in our global communities. And similarly in Q1 we face continued macro uncertainty, which combined with supply the manufacturing constraints impacted our revenue, particularly in Compute. Despite, these issues and the current market backdrop, we continue to execute with discipline and make progress against our strategic priorities. We outperformed the market in critical areas like the intelligent edge. We gain traction in High Performance Compute with acquisition of Cray. We advance our people to as-a-service all while delivering EPS and gross margin expansion. While we made progress in these important areas, we know we have work to do to improve in others. We are living in an uncertain time, but what is certain is our commitment to continue to manage our business with focus and discipline. I believe in our sound strategy, in our talented team and in our differentiated technology. This combination will enable us to execute our pivot to provide our customers and partners unique edge-to-cloud experiences delivered as-a-service. By doing so, we expect to deliver long term profitable growth and generate stakeholder value. With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to provide more details about the quarter.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much Antonio. Now let me provide more detail on our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'd be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, please note that we are now reporting results according to our new segmentation. This will provide more granular detail on the financial performance of our businesses and our progress towards becoming the edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service company. Please refer to our recently filed Form 8-K for more detailed information, which includes historical reconciliation tables for the last two years. Antonio already discussed the high-level points for the quarter, but I want to briefly reiterate the main takeaway. We are continuing to execute on our transition to higher margin and more recurring revenue areas in a challenging business environment. We also remain confident that we have the right strategy in place and are taking the right actions to lay a foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in the future. Turning to Slide 2, with the financial highlights for the quarter, despite the top line challenges from uneven demand and component supply and manufacturing constraints that I'll provide more detail on shortly, we continued to expand non-GAAP gross margins which improved by 210 basis points this year, driven primarily by portfolio mix shift, cost of services, efficiencies and commodity cost tailwinds. This gross margin expansion combined with other income and expense benefits that included record equity interest contributed from our ownership in HPC and share buybacks resulted in diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 which is up 5% year-over-year and in line with our original outlook for the quarter. On the cash front, free cash flow was a use of $185 million, which was in line with the prior year and normal seasonality. Consistent with our capital management and policy we paid $156 million in dividends and repurchased $204 million in shares. From a macro perspective, as Antonio mentioned, geopolitical factors continue to close business uncertainty, particularly in larger enterprise deals creating an uneven and unpredictable business environment. This was further exacerbated by supply constraints, both component shortages and our North American manufacturing site consolidation which affected the Compute business in particular. We expect component shortages to remain a headwind and this situation to alleviate as we progress through the year. The North American manufacturing site consolidation has created near term execution challenges that we are actively addressing and expect to have improved efficiencies and agilities in our supply chain moving forward. Adding to the uncertainty is the potential disruption to demand and supply caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The health issue is causing disruption to both supply and demand and while we cannot quantify the real impact at this time, we're monitoring the situation closely and are working with our suppliers to minimize potential impacts. We'll now move to Slide 3, that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew 4%. Our changes to North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off with double-digit growth in North America and 13% growth in overall wireless LAN product. While we continue to make relevant R&D and sales investments this year, we are also delivering significant improvement in profitability with operating margins of 9.7% up 630 basis points year-over-year.  In Compute revenue declined 15% this quarter due to the previously highlighted uneven demand environment, component supply constraints and North American manufacturing site consolidation, yet we delivered a 9.5% operating profit-margin in line with last year. With respect to units excluding Tier 1 in China, our units were up mid-single digits year-over-year and have also been growing sequentially since Q2 2019. In High Performance Compute and Mission Critical Systems, we grew revenue 6% that included our first full quarter contribution from Cray. Our HPC business has been awarded over $2 billion of business that is expected to be delivered through fiscal year 2023. We will also optimize the Cray cost envelope and expect triple digit millions in annualized run rate, cost synergies to be recognized by the end of the next fiscal year significantly adding to the operating profit and margins of HPC and MCS. Within Storage, we made progress against a competitive backdrop, maintaining flat sequential revenues with notable strength in big data growing at 45% year-over-year and Hyperconverged Infrastructure growing at 6% year-over-year this quarter. Note that this is the first quarter, we are reporting Hyperconverged Infrastructure and Storage aligned to our peers. In Advisory & Professional Services, we are reporting for the first time in our new segmentation revenue was flat and we significantly improved operating margins by 12.5 points year-over-year as we focus on eliminating unprofitable business. Operational Services, which is included across compute, HPC and MCS and Storage orders were up 1% year-over-year and revenue was down 2%. Our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per unit, was up year-over-year again in every business segment this quarter with double-digit growth in HPC and MCS, Services Intensity driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust. Within HPE financial services, we expanded our net portfolio of assets, which was up 2% in constant currency this quarter with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake and we maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again this quarter with bad debt loss ratio of 0.4% which is best-in-class within this industry. And while not shown on the slide, Communications and Media Solutions that is included in our Corporate Investment segment is a strategically important business to us providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. It is showing improved momentum. Orders in CMS were up 10% sequentially and revenue was up 2% due to improved momentum of the telco software and services business. Slide 4 shows the ARR slide that I discussed at our securities analyst meeting in October, 2019. Please reference the SAM presentation for a deep dive into what makes up the ARR. Our Q1 2020 ARR actuals came in at $511 million a 19% year-over-year growth that accelerated from last quarter. Our HPE Aruba Central platform is starting to gain traction with revenue growing triple digits year-over-year. We also continue to see strong growth in GreenLake services orders, which were up 48% year-over-year. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as-a-service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as-a-service, we are confident in achieving our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2022. Slide 5, shows our EPS performance to-date, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 in Q1 is in-line with our previously provided outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 due to disciplined execution, expanding gross margins and favorable other income and expense. This represents year-over-year growth of 5% also, please note our OI&E performance in Q1 of fiscal year 2020 does not change our fiscal year 2020 OI&E outlook. As we foreshadowed during last October, Securities Analyst Meeting, we continue to expect OI&E to be a $0.03 to $0.05 per share headwind in fiscal year 2020. Turning to gross margins on Slide 6, we continue to deliver a significant year-over-year gross margin expansion that was up 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2% as we shifted to a higher margin offerings like the Intelligent Edge with Aruba Central Hyperconverged Infrastructure, the addition of Cray and commodity cost tailwinds.  Moving to Slide 7, we have continued to improve operating profits since the beginning of Q1 of fiscal year 2018, while making strategic investments in R&D and sales to support long term profitable growth. In Q1 of fiscal year 2020 we're now consolidating a full quarter of additional operating expenses from the Cray acquisition that will be optimized going forward. Furthermore, given the additional uncertainty in the business environment introduced this quarter, we are taking near term actions that will enable us to protect and expand our profitability in fiscal year 2020, while continuing to make critical long term investments. As Antonio mentioned, we would extend the HPE Next program into fiscal year 2021 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. Turning to cash flow on Slide 8, operating cash flow declined with revenue $461 million year-over-year. Free cash flow for Q1 was in-line with normal seasonality at negative $185 million in-line with the prior year, thanks to planned net CapEx benefits in the quarter. Please remember our normal seasonality is for cash to be used in the first half and then we generate significant amounts of free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year. Now as a reminder on Slide 9, we maintained a solid balance sheet with our cash flow generation and we have a disciplined returns based process for evaluating investments and capital returns. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating that is evidenced by our current operating net cash position. Consistent with our capital return commitments, in Q1 we returned $360 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As part of our capital allocation framework, we also target value enhancing acquisitions to improve our competitive positioning and to accelerate our strategy of pivoting to as-a-service that provides us with higher levels of recurring revenue and profitability. As with any investment we consider, we follow a rigorous evaluation process, cognizant of size, valuation, financial impact, such as accretion, dilution, and strategic fit. Now, turning to our outlook on Slide 10, as discussed, we are in an increasingly uneven business environment, but at this point we're comfortable maintaining our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP EPS outlook of a $1.78 to a $1.94 given the cost actions we plan to take and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time. However, there's still considerable uncertainty in the short term due to the unknown potential impacts from the coronavirus, so we're not in a position to provide our second quarter outlook. From a cash flow perspective and given our negative cash conversion cycle, we expect some current year impact on working capital receivables with elongated sales cycles persisting and the need to build inventory levels due to the supply chain constraints. Consequently, we feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year 2020 free cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. We remain committed to our previously announced capital management policy of returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders and now expect to be at the higher end of that range for fiscal year 2020. Overall, we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities within an uneven environment and introduce new challenges this quarter. We're taking the appropriate actions to navigate the near term uncertainty while executing against our vision and strategy that is really resonating with customers. We will continue to shift our portfolio to higher margin software defined solutions and focus on delivering our edge to cloud platform, offering our full portfolio as a service by 2022. This will ultimately drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long term. Now with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Tarek, how much do you think that temporary factors like component constraints, the supply chain disruption can coronavirus and the factory consolidation in North America had on total revenue. And then as a follow-up, Antonio, given how important revenue growth is for stock price performance and valuation, can you talk about the investments you're making and the timeline investors should think about to return the company to growth and how dependent is that path on M&A. Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Okay. Good afternoon Katy. Thank you for the question. With respect to how much those short term disruptions have accounted for our revenue performance, I would say quite a lot. There are three things that affected our revenue performance. These are the macro environment softness. The second thing is supply chain constraints. And the third one is also the manufacturing north consolidation in North America. We've taken steps to address what's under our control. Nonetheless, coronavirus has effected the tail end of the quarter and injected a new degree of uncertainty. And when you look at the revenue performance of the company, most of the decline came in the Compute category that we referred to in our new segmentation and that decline has a lot to do with what you referred to from a supply chain standpoint.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Good afternoon Katy. And thanks for the question and just will add to Tarek that we felt pretty good about the recovery in the north consolidation that's under our control. All the other factors Tarek explained very well. In term of, when think about investment long term, we have been very clear where we want to invest. Investment obviously is in Intelligent Edge. We see that as a next frontier, big opportunity for us. We continue to do so. And I have to say I'm incredibly pleased with the Q1 performance because we said that business would return to growth and we show, we demonstrated that\u2019s the case.  We outperformed the market and every single competitor there and we are very, very pleased with the differentiation we have with our portfolio with higher margin. So for us, that's one area of investment, much of that growth has happened organically. But we always look for what it makes sense for us in term of accretive addition in term of intellectual property and talent, right, that we want to continue to expand that set of experience we deliver at the edge. And as I said in my opening remarks, we are on a journey to integrate 5G and mobile edge computing on a very robust cloud based solution called HPE Aruba Central, which is all subscription base and obviously we can deliver that through GreenLake. Obviously the other piece of this is what I call intellectual property to make our core business stronger. And that's all softer decline on the core with some additional call it intellectual property in the Silicon space. That's what the core of the Cray acquisition was all about. The Cray acquisition is all about software in a cloud native environment to run these big data intensive workloads. And silicone was all about that. And as I think about the pivot as-a-service also we looking for software that will make our as-a-service experience unique and differentiated in a true age to cloud platform. And as I announced in my remarks, we introduced two key platforms. One is HPE GreenLake Central, which is the console, the control point for managing and deploying workloads at the edge in the core on off premises. So we add that managed services layer on top of that and then the container platform, which is a true cloud native environment, where you can run both legacy and cloud based workloads. So those are the things we are doing, but I just want to emphasize, we have a very stringent and rigorous process here on return on invested capital. And I see as in M&A as one of the three levels to drive innovation. Organic is one aspect, partnership is the other one and inorganic. And I say that the last 15 acquisition I had been part of it has been always in that vein and that's our goal.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you.\nAndrew Simanek: Thank you. Katy. Can we go to the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nJeriel Ong: Awesome. Thank you, so much. I appreciate you giving me a chance to ask a question. To start off, is there any guidance for revenue for the year and focusing on the quarter itself, could you quantify or for the guided quarter, could you quantify maybe how much below seasonal you think the these coronavirus impacts and supply chain constraints could impact the next quarter?\nTarek Robbiati: Okay. So let me start by the second part of your question, which is how much of an impact will the coronavirus have on our business? Well, first as we already flagged the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is our priority and out of abundance of caution for them, we've made the decision to cancel or postpone most of the HPE sponsors events through April. And unfortunately, this is also closing supply and demand disruptions and effecting our revenue profile. The outbreak at the end of January, started to impact the component manufacturing and resulted in constrained supply and higher quarter-end backlog worldwide. And we have been in constant contact with our suppliers and are establishing specific mitigation and recovery plans. So, this is affecting our revenue profile for the full year. And this is why we're not guiding in the short term and relative to what we said at SAM where we were experiencing \u2013 we were thinking we would be returning to growth in fiscal year 2020. I don't think that it is likely at this stage that we were going fiscal year 2020 as a whole for the fiscal year, but we do anticipate recovery of those supply chain constraints over time and face easier comps during the course of the year.\nAntonio Neri: I would like to add a couple of comments. One is on the coronavirus. Obviously, this is very fluid at this point in time there is uncertainty. We have a daily process with each of our suppliers that we manage very, very tightly and some of those, the suppliers are dependant on other suppliers. Because as you can imagine that supply chain is a little bit longer with the tier two, tier three suppliers that provide what I call low-level components to build what I call the printed circuit board. So the PCIs or the PCBIs and that's a challenge we see today. And we see recovery, but obviously it's going to take time and that's why Tarek said, we cannot provide right now a definite guidance. I think would be not appropriate and that's why we prefer not to provide Q2, but because of the recovery is going to happen through the year, that we felt comfortable reaffirming the 2020 guidance. If you remember when we went to the Security Analyst Meeting in October, we said that we expect to grow the company on a three years basis, long term plan or 1% to 3%. I think that this is still complete and intact because as you can see, as we pivot the portfolio to higher value and higher margins at the same time, the pivot as-a-service, which is going extremely well, and then obviously Intelligent Edge business growing. That's how we think about the long term growth in the right margin profile. Obviously the Compute at this point in time was the challenge short term. I don't think it was off compared to some of our peers. In fact, in some cases we did better than our peers, but that was a disappointment and obviously we need to stabilize it and manage it through the supply chain recovery.\nAndrew Simanek: Thank you. Can we go to the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I have a question and a follow-up. First I was wondering if you could provide book-to-bill information or backlog information for the Compute business for this year relative to the end of Q1 last year. I think that would provide incremental confidence and insight into how much of this is component in your inability to fulfill versus how much of this is kind of a demand issue. So, a book-to-bill for Compute this year versus last year and/or backlog for Compute this year versus last year. And I have a follow-up please.\nTarek Robbiati: Sure Toni. Good afternoon and thanks for the question. I don't have the book-to-bill but I can tell you we entered Q2 which is the quarter we're in with higher backlog than we anticipated and definitely it is more on the elevated side. And so that's true for Compute and as well a carryover for high performance compute, which are the core of that product. Toni is the legacy HPE Apollo. So we enter Q2 with a higher elevated backlog than we have seen. I don't see yet let me qualify this outside China. I haven't seen yet a significant impact on demand so far. Definitely in China, as you know we have a different setup with our H3C partnership there. And you should expect a short term impact in China. But right now they are working it through it. But I will say right now we haven't seen a significant impact. If anything actually creates short term opportunities. I can tell you because of the coronavirus we see customers coming to us and say, can you ship this product to take care of the fact that my employees are not going to be at work. We see some demand in specific areas of our workload optimized solutions. And as I said in my opening remarks, we do have as an awarded business, which obviously we have to build and ship more than $2 billion in HPC business that we have to ship over the next several quarters in the next two years. And that business is doing very well from my vantage point, but it is obviously segregate in two different segments, compute and on the other hand, HPC and Mission Critical.\nToni Sacconaghi: Okay. Thank you. If I could just follow-up I'd love to get your impression of the stock. It's obviously very beaten down and I'd like your view on that. And you've talked about your openness to doing acquisitions. And I'm wondering if you could clarify whether there's a size limit or whether you would go to 10 billion, but also are there other structural moves that you would consider? So would you consider taking on debt and aggressively repurchasing your own shares given the valuation right now like HPQ has done. And would you consider other portfolio moves such as divesting businesses like, just for example, because it's small and orphaned A&PS or other businesses. So how \u2013 what do you think of the stock? How big the acquisition size? Would you think about debt repurchase? And how about divestment? Thank you..\nAntonio Neri: And I'm going to start then I'm going to give it to Tarek. Let me talk about the stock. Listen, I think it is a point in, kind of situation in my view, we are heavily discounted. There's no question about it. But think about the last nine quarters, Toni, and think about the gross margin expansion and the EPS expansion we have had. It is pretty remarkable. I mean, the last two years we expanded the margins every single quarter and we have expanded EPS every single quarter. So my vantage point, we have done the right things. We have made the company leaner, meaner, and at the same time we have taken big, big, big challenges. And we have managed it through. So, I think for us is to continue to focus on the areas where we see the opportunity to compete and win in higher margins. But obviously the stock also thinking about long term growth and I understand that and obviously a big component of that is our Compute business, but in the end, I think the stock is heavily discounted. I'm disappointed with that. On the M&A, we have been very clear since day one that we look at assets that they are accessible that generally they are accretive or we can manage the dilution very quickly, but ultimately is, has to have strategic fit. In the context of our strategy, obviously, whether it is the edge-to-cloud architecture and pivot to know as-a-service I think the assets we have acquired makes complete sense from that vantage point and we have delivered strong results. Size is important, but I will say it's more strategic effect and obviously the return on that investment capital, which we have incredible strong discipline and where we have demonstrated at over the last two years. And so, maybe I will pass it now to Tarek because you asked the question about taking debt and buying stock and so forth.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. So, Toni, I would say, Antonio answered the question on the stock. I would simply point to you at the performance of the values part of our business, the Intelligent Edge, which has outperformed the sector quite substantially this quarter. What's the value of that? If you look at our storage business, which has done better than most of the players in the market and is of the same size as a very large pure-play listed company, what's the value of that? And if you look at our HPC and MCS business and the $2 billion of backlog contracted revenues that would come in, what's the value of that? And then you have to look at other players in the sector and compare our compute business to them and see that also for those players that compute business is valued negatively from an equity standpoint, but it does generate cash and we have to figure that out. Finally, let me finish by saying HPC, the production was the value of that. It's a listed company and it's pretty substantial. So I'll let you conclude whether the stock is beaten down or not and how much is beaten down and probably in your own question you have the answer. Well, expected acquisitions \u2013 sorry, go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: No, I was just going to say, you basically said I think it's really beaten down, especially on some of the parts. So then are you or why wouldn't you consider much more aggressively repurchasing your own shares at these levels?\nTarek Robbiati: So the thing that we \u2013 let me just finish up answering the other part and I'll come back to your question on buying share. With respect to acquisitions, Antonio answered very, very clearly. We remain disciplined in that field when we're not going to look at acquisitions that don't fit our investment criteria from an accretion dilutions standpoint. It's very, very important. We do that. A&PS, specifically for A&PS, it's a very strategic business that pulls a lot of revenue and profits in other parts of the organization and it's essential for enabling the as-a-service pivot. Now coming back on to your question with respect to aggressive buybacks, we did in the past two years execute a $7 billion capital return program to shareholders. We returned 2.9 billion by way of dividends and 4.1 by way of buybacks. And what we did flag at SAM is the fact that we are going to continue to return capital to shareholders in line with our free cash flow generation capacity. We're not going to deviate from this because it's important that we continue to think about the long-term value of those businesses and each one of those businesses has its own investment profile and needs to be therefore catered for.\nAntonio Neri: Thank you.\nToni Sacconaghi: Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Thanks, Toni. \nAndrew Simanek: Thanks, Toni.\nAntonio Neri: Can we go to the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking the question. I wanted to look more at your cost cutting actions. I think you talked about taking actions during the current quarter, which maybe curtailing travel, which obviously would save money, but more importantly how are you thinking about the expansion of Next? Is this sort of a reevaluation of your cost base? Or is it more sort of a continuation of your usual productivity actions? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Sure. So thank you Shannon for this question. When first and foremost you may recall when I joined HPE 14 months ago, I use the expression that SAM in 2018 that looking at our cost structure was akin to a fitness exercise. And it's always important that we look at our cost structure based on the revenue profile that we have and it's no different right now. Specifically to HPE Next, we are continuing the implementation of the program in that context where we have to align our cost structure to the new business climate that exists. We're not announcing a new restructuring plan. And what is happening is that through the implementation of the new segmentation, we have identified new savings opportunities in each of the businesses and we'll continue to streamline our operations in that context.\nAntonio Neri: I would say Shannon a couple of things. So I think that what we have done in the last two years give us insights on how we can streamline our operations and be even more agile in focus on everything we do. And as you recall, the HPE Next was really transformative from the process standpoint as well as from the IT perspective. And I will say for the vast majority of everything was executed flawlessly and we have delivered the results with a gross margin expansion you see. As we implemented this new segmentation, now we can see through even better visibility on what else we can go and do. And as Tarek just said it right, the reality is you never stop focusing on improving your operations and because the HPE Next actually at the quarter was a cultural transformation, it give us the ability now to take further actions, which are actually I will argue timely considering the uncertainty we live in, but it's to do the hard things now as these things recovered to come on the other end even stronger than before. On the short-term actions, I think first we have to protect our employees. First and foremost, I think, it\u2019s important. And that was the first step. And then obviously that comes with the benefits and the savings, but I want to be clear, this is all about protecting our employees to make sure they don't get exposed for things they don't need to.\nShannon Cross: Thank you. And then can you talk a little bit about what you've seen just in the last couple of weeks in terms of production capability or capacity and things coming online. I'm just curious because some of the other companies in the space have started to mention that they're seeing some improvement in the supply chain. Again, this is more on the China side, but just in terms of availability of components in that and when we talk to is even indicated that almost on a daily basis things were getting better. So I'm just curious as if you can talk at all about near-term trends.\nAntonio Neri: Yes, no, that's correct. We see kind of the same thing. Obviously, some company has been aligned for some time and they have been recovering on a daily basis, the output of their facilities or their capacity. Obviously, the biggest constraint they had at the time was labor because obviously depending on the region within China, but eventually it became the entire China for the most part is the health measures and certifications that they have to go through. But in general, I will say, it progressed every single day and whether it is people coming online or people improving the output or what we\u2019re already doing. And so that's progressing. And so you have to take it day by day. And obviously, what we're doing is, because we have a global supply chain here is \u2013 China is one aspect, but also how we manage inventory and how we manage the distribution of those orders in a way we can maximize the return while these things gets back to normal. That's how we are managing it. And to be honest, we have a very stringent process with war rooms and talking to suppliers every single day. I personally have talked to at least 50 of them, myself and I have direct contact with each of them.\nAndrew Simanek: Great, thank you.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nAndrew Simanek: Thank you, Shannon. Can we go to the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Your free cash flow guidance came down but EPS did not. I was wondering, are you still expecting the same operating profit dollars? Or are there other items, some benefits below the line that that are contemplated within your guidance and have a follow up?\nTarek Robbiati: Yes, thank you, Wamsi. So you remember last year, this time of the year, we did say that from a free cash flow standpoint, working capital would be a contributor to cash. And that is what happened last year. This year, we have attained the point where our cash conversion cycle is negative. And whilst we do deliver the EPS guide and we confirmed it per Antonio, the drop in revenue will inevitably have a drag on the free cash flow generation. That is because we have a negative free cash flow cycle. So the way cash tracks earnings is a combination of what happens in the P&L at EPS level, but also the working capital components that comes with a P&L and the revenue from the accounts receivable side and also the fact that we need to build inventory to be able to cater for the supply chain shortages that we explained. That is what is behind the difference between the P&L EPS performance and the free cash flow guide that we put forward.\nAntonio Neri: And I will say in 2020 obviously it's a timing issue as we recover the supply chain and that is a timing from the \u2013 when we can build and ship these products obviously and also the fact that we have to rebuild some of the inventory because as the operations in China and other parts of the world maybe were impacted. We had to manage that inventory and now we have to build it back over time.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you. Antonio, you commented on sort of the uncertainty surrounding 2Q, but you're also seen to be confident on the fiscal year guide. I understand HPE Next is under your control. But what gives you confidence that this demand comes back? It's clear that things in China are improving, but when you sort of think about the demand environment globally, what gives you confidence that the demand is going to come back in the second half because that's what it seems implicitly what is embedded in your full year guide? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes, I mean, first, let's start with some of the businesses I have reported earlier and Tarek provided detail. Obviously, the Intelligent Edge, we see continued momentum. That is continuing right now as we speak. We feel pretty good about that. Much of the supply chain is not gated in China for the Intelligent Edge, so that's a positive news. Then obviously on high performance computing, the demand continues to be solid. And we have a very interesting pipeline ahead of us with a unique differentiated portfolio. So the need for processing data through AI, machine learning, big data intensive loads continue to be very high. That's not stopping. As we think about these new storage platforms, particularly what I call intelligent data platform, the data growth requires that that data gets stored and gets managed and ultimately insights are extracted from it, so that's positive as well. Right now, as I said earlier, as we went through Q2, we enter with a sizable backlog because we couldn't ship it, in Q1 everything we wanted. And at the same time, we haven't seen yet outside China a significant impact, but obviously as we think about the second back of the year here, obviously we expect to things to return to a level of normalcy that eventually will allows us to continue to progress against that. That's how I see it right now. And because of everything we do both from a mix perspective with the pivot obviously as-a-service, which is a long-term opportunity and growing and the fact we're taking our own actions here with HPE Next and other ones. And that's why at this point in time, we felt comfortable in affirming the original guidance that we provided here on EPS. So we felt prudent to adjust the cash flow for the dynamics Tarek explained earlier.\nWamsi Mohan: Perfect. Okay. Thank you.\nAndrew Simanek: Perfect. Thank you, Wamsi. I think we have time for one last question please.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I've got two. One is probably really simple, so I'll ask that one first and then the follow-up. What are your expectations for the full year's net CapEx? If you could answer that and then I've got a follow up.\nTarek Robbiati: Look, net CapEx for this year is not a particularly large number. In this first half of the year, we have benefited from in plan sales that have reduced our overall CapEx consumption. And we think that from a CapEx standpoint we\u2019re in line with prior years. I don't see beyond the first quarter performance, a significant uptick in CapEx this year.\nAntonio Neri: We don't have any specific CapEx expenditures that they are extraordinary from what we had seen before.\nSimon Leopold: Okay. And then the other one I wanted to see if you could give us some better insight is to understand how much money you would be able to borrow say for acquisitions or other purposes yet still maintain your investment grade credit rating. I believe that's important to you. So just I want to get a better understanding of what the sort of maximum borrowing could be. Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Well, it really depends on what you borrow the money for to some extent, right. And that's a question. But if you really want to look at how do we maintain our investment grade rating and what would be our borrowing capacity maintaining than the investment grade rating, it's probably around the $5 billion mark.\nAntonio Neri: But I want to make sure that one thing is clear, right. We are committed to maintain our credit rating.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thank you, Simon. I think with that we can close down the call.\nAntonio Neri: All right, thank you.\nAndrew Simanek: Thank you everyone for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today. HPE's first quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our strategic priorities to shift our company to higher margin and more recurring revenues against a dynamic market backdrop. I am disappointed that our overall revenue is $6.9 billion, reflects a 7% decline for the quarter, primarily due to declines in our compute business. However, I am pleased with the results in several key areas of our business aligned to our strategy. Our pivot to as-a-service is gaining momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate grew 19% year-over-year. We started reporting this new metric last quarter to provide more transparency into the recurring and higher margin benefits of shifting to our as-a-service model. We grew HPE GreenLake services' orders 48% year-over-year. HPE GreenLake gained 65 new logos in Q1 and has surpassed 800 total customers. We returned to growth in our Intelligent Edge business with revenue up 4% year-over-year and we continue to see profitable growth in areas of investment including High Performance Compute, Hyperconverged Infrastructure, Big Data Storage and Operational Services orders with continued improvements in our services attach intensity. Our Q1 revenues were impacted by a number of factors. First, like many of our peers, we continue to see uneven and unpredictable demand due to macro uncertainty. This has resulted in longer sales cycles and delayed customer decisions. Second, commodity supply constraints disrupted our ability to meet our customer's demand this quarter, particularly in our compute and high performance compute businesses. Additionally, the outbreak of the coronavirus at the end of January impacted component manufacturing resulting in higher quarter and backlogs. In both of these cases, we have established specific mitigation and recovering plans with each of our suppliers. Finally, we encountered a challenge in consolidating a manufacturing site in North America. We have a plan in place to address the Q1 issue and are confident that our efforts will result in increased efficiency and agility as we move forward. It is important to note that even with the revenue shortfall, we improved our non-GAAP gross margin by 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2%. We drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44, up 5% year-over-year and inline with our outlook, while also invest in for future innovation. And we delivered improved free cash flow compared to last year's level and in line with Q1 normal seasonality. While market uncertainty continues and new global developments like the coronavirus have emerged, we have taken the right actions to mitigate against these evolving dynamics. Some of these actions includes further cost account in our backend operations as a part of our HPE Next program, which has been a key enabler of our gross and operating margin improvement. We had extended the program through fiscal year 2021 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. As Tarek will cover in more detail because of the actions we have taken to address the uncertainty and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time. We are comfortable maintaining our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP EPS outlook, but there are too many unknowns at this point to provide second quarter guidance. Also, we do feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year 2023 cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Given that we expect some impact on cash conversion cycles driven by the ongoing recovery from supply constraints and the impact of the coronavirus. These are the right pragmatic actions to take and I am confident in our ability to deliver in our strategy. Our customers continue to reaffirm their need for hybrid capabilities to advise their digital transformations and harness the power of their data, whatever it lives in the cloud, on and off premises and increasingly at the edge. As the edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service company, HPE is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends and help our customers to transform. Before Tarek provides more specifics about the quarter, let me highlight a few of our business and segment results. First, our Intelligent Edge business outperformed competitors across the industry. We grew in all geographies posting double-digit growth in North America despite the challenging macro environment and we delivered double-digit growth in our Aruba branded products. Over the last two quarters, we have been actively enhancing our sales coverage model in North America and I am proud of the team hard work and our momentum. We declared the opportunity at the Intelligent Edge early and we continue to invest in bringing in a cloud experience to the Edge where data is increasingly created. At the core of the strategy is HPE Aruba Central, the only cloud native and simple to use platform that unifies network management, AI-power insights and IoT device security for wire, wireless and WAN networks and soon 5G and edge computing. More than 58,000 unique customers are using Aruba Central. In Q1, Aruba, which pioneered the software-defined branch solution for deployment and management of large retail networks further enhance our solution by integrating Aruba branch gateways with Aruba Central by providing a single point of control for SD1 wire and wireless networking. Aruba can help customers achieve secure simplified brunch connectivity at scale. Our customers continue to recognize our innovation at the edge. For instance, in the first quarter, the office of information technology at Princeton University turned to ArubaOS-CX to support its wire initiative and seamlessly integrate with Aruba wireless with a goal of creating a complete Mobile-First Campus of the future. Sub-Zero a leading looks to the appliance maker updated its wired with wireless infrastructure through ArubaOS-CX and Instant wireless to support IoT in high-end appliances. Both our ArubaOS-CX and Wi-Fi 6 solutions continue to gain traction in the market. The customer examples I share are a testament of our differentiated innovation. I am excited about how our market leadership is helping customers to redefine experiences at the edge. We will continue to enhance our portfolio with integration of 5G and mobile edge computing to capitalize on this significant opportunity. Turning to Hybrid IT, as we announced at our Securities Analyst Meeting last fall, we are providing revenue and operating profit disclosures in four business segments: Compute, High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, Storage, and Advisory and Profession Services aligned to customer demands and market trends. Tarek will walk you through the financial results in greater detail and let me share a few high level observations. As I noted earlier, our compute revenue was impacted by a combination of factors and came in lower than anticipated for the quarter. However, we did see an acceleration in unit volumes, which were up mid single digits year-over-year, excluding Tier 1 in China. Our High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems segment includes the first full quarter of Cray. We are excited about the combination of HPE and Cray and the growing time. We have been awarded more than $2 billion in HPC business expected to be delivered in the next three years. Programs include the U.S. Department of Energy's El Capitan System at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Frontier supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory among others. Our new segmentation provide greater insights in through the size, strength and attractive financial profile of our HPE Storage business, which is $5 billion business with an operating margin of 18%. We gained momentum in key areas during the quarter and expect to gain share in external disk. Big Data storage grew 45% year-over-year and demonstrates early success with our MapR acquisition. Hyperconverged Infrastructure also continued to grow up 6%. HPE InfoSight, our cloud-based AI operations platform gained momentum across both storage and compute. I am proud of our focused efforts and innovation that have created one of the most comprehensive intelligent data platform in the industry, which will continue to provide customers with superior simplicity and performance. Our Advisory & Professional Services business provides strategy, technology planning and consultant services that help customers navigate their digital transformation from edge to cloud. With the increased focus and simplification of this business, we draw demand across the HPE portfolio and significantly expanded operating margins this quarter, up 12.5 points year-over-year. Our customer wins demonstrate the strength of our strategy and breadth of our portfolio. For example, HPE was recently selected by Zenuity, a joint venture between Volvo Cars and Veoneer to help make next generation autonomous driving cars reality. HPE will provide the crucial AI and High Performance Compute and required to gather, store, organize and analyze data from its global network test vehicles and software development centers. The end to end solution will be delivered as-a-service through HPE GreenLake. [Indiscernible] a global electronics company wanted to reduce storage complexity and reclaim claim management time. Already relying on three parts for business critical applications, the company chose nimble storage to help manage that 20% year-over-year growth in data. This new combination has improved performance threefold. Volkswagen Group selected HPE to deliver state-of-the-art Compute & Mission Critical servers to run its apps and solutions like SAP HANA, virtual desktop infrastructure and others focused on Big Data Analytics, AI and autonomous driving. Our offerings such as HPE Superdome Flex, HPE ProLiant Gen10 servers and HPE Pointnext support services will power the data and apps for the Volkswagen Group's 12 global brands. In Q1, we continue to accelerate innovation. We achieved a major milestone in our pivot to as-a-service with the launch of HPE GreenLake central platform. HPE GreenLake central is an advanced cloud platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all the application and data wherever they live through an operational console that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid estate. We launched our HPE Container Platform, which is the first enterprise grade Kubernetes-based container solution. It leverages HPE's acquisition of BlueData and MapR together with 100% open-source Kubernetes software. This platform provides customers with a common and faster path to run legacy and cloud-native applications with persistence/storage connectivity. And we acquired Scytale, an innovative software company focused on service authentication. The Scytale team are the founding contributors to two open-source projects that they are positioned to become the de facto standards for identifying and securing enterprise workloads both on and off premises. Our Scytale acquisition is consistent with our targeted approach to M&A that brings critical talent and complementary technologies to HPE. We look for accretive value enhancing acquisitions that improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our strategy. Finally, our HPE Financial Services business continues to provide us with the critical competitive advantage. In Q1, overall financing volume increased 2%. GreenLake represented more than 40% of our HPE leasing volume. HPEFS uses multiple leavers to help customers accelerated digital transformations while contributing to the circular economy. Through asset upcycling and accelerated migration HPEFS free up well over $500 million in our customers' budgets over the last two years. This business help our customers capture value from older assets, achieve their sustainability goals, and invest in new technologies as-a-service. As we advance our business objectives to meet our customer needs and deliver for our shareholders, we continue to be guided by very strong purpose. I am tremendously proud of our environmental stewardship, our investments in our people and our culture of integrity and inclusion. HPE was just recognized as one of the Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute. We were also proud to be named to Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. These are very important measures of how HPE delivers for our team members, customers, shareholders in our global communities. And similarly in Q1 we face continued macro uncertainty, which combined with supply the manufacturing constraints impacted our revenue, particularly in Compute. Despite, these issues and the current market backdrop, we continue to execute with discipline and make progress against our strategic priorities. We outperformed the market in critical areas like the intelligent edge. We gain traction in High Performance Compute with acquisition of Cray. We advance our people to as-a-service all while delivering EPS and gross margin expansion. While we made progress in these important areas, we know we have work to do to improve in others. We are living in an uncertain time, but what is certain is our commitment to continue to manage our business with focus and discipline. I believe in our sound strategy, in our talented team and in our differentiated technology. This combination will enable us to execute our pivot to provide our customers and partners unique edge-to-cloud experiences delivered as-a-service. By doing so, we expect to deliver long term profitable growth and generate stakeholder value. With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to provide more details about the quarter. Yes. Good afternoon Katy. And thanks for the question and just will add to Tarek that we felt pretty good about the recovery in the north consolidation that's under our control. All the other factors Tarek explained very well. In term of, when think about investment long term, we have been very clear where we want to invest. Investment obviously is in Intelligent Edge. We see that as a next frontier, big opportunity for us. We continue to do so. And I have to say I'm incredibly pleased with the Q1 performance because we said that business would return to growth and we show, we demonstrated that's the case.  We outperformed the market and every single competitor there and we are very, very pleased with the differentiation we have with our portfolio with higher margin. So for us, that's one area of investment, much of that growth has happened organically. But we always look for what it makes sense for us in term of accretive addition in term of intellectual property and talent, right, that we want to continue to expand that set of experience we deliver at the edge. And as I said in my opening remarks, we are on a journey to integrate 5G and mobile edge computing on a very robust cloud based solution called HPE Aruba Central, which is all subscription base and obviously we can deliver that through GreenLake. Obviously the other piece of this is what I call intellectual property to make our core business stronger. And that's all softer decline on the core with some additional call it intellectual property in the Silicon space. That's what the core of the Cray acquisition was all about. The Cray acquisition is all about software in a cloud native environment to run these big data intensive workloads. And silicone was all about that. And as I think about the pivot as-a-service also we looking for software that will make our as-a-service experience unique and differentiated in a true age to cloud platform. And as I announced in my remarks, we introduced two key platforms. One is HPE GreenLake Central, which is the console, the control point for managing and deploying workloads at the edge in the core on off premises. So we add that managed services layer on top of that and then the container platform, which is a true cloud native environment, where you can run both legacy and cloud based workloads. So those are the things we are doing, but I just want to emphasize, we have a very stringent and rigorous process here on return on invested capital. And I see as in M&A as one of the three levels to drive innovation. Organic is one aspect, partnership is the other one and inorganic. And I say that the last 15 acquisition I had been part of it has been always in that vein and that's our goal. I would like to add a couple of comments. One is on the coronavirus. Obviously, this is very fluid at this point in time there is uncertainty. We have a daily process with each of our suppliers that we manage very, very tightly and some of those, the suppliers are dependant on other suppliers. Because as you can imagine that supply chain is a little bit longer with the tier two, tier three suppliers that provide what I call low-level components to build what I call the printed circuit board. So the PCIs or the PCBIs and that's a challenge we see today. And we see recovery, but obviously it's going to take time and that's why Tarek said, we cannot provide right now a definite guidance. I think would be not appropriate and that's why we prefer not to provide Q2, but because of the recovery is going to happen through the year, that we felt comfortable reaffirming the 2020 guidance. If you remember when we went to the Security Analyst Meeting in October, we said that we expect to grow the company on a three years basis, long term plan or 1% to 3%. I think that this is still complete and intact because as you can see, as we pivot the portfolio to higher value and higher margins at the same time, the pivot as-a-service, which is going extremely well, and then obviously Intelligent Edge business growing. That's how we think about the long term growth in the right margin profile. Obviously the Compute at this point in time was the challenge short term. I don't think it was off compared to some of our peers. In fact, in some cases we did better than our peers, but that was a disappointment and obviously we need to stabilize it and manage it through the supply chain recovery. And I'm going to start then I'm going to give it to Tarek. Let me talk about the stock. Listen, I think it is a point in, kind of situation in my view, we are heavily discounted. There's no question about it. But think about the last nine quarters, Toni, and think about the gross margin expansion and the EPS expansion we have had. It is pretty remarkable. I mean, the last two years we expanded the margins every single quarter and we have expanded EPS every single quarter. So my vantage point, we have done the right things. We have made the company leaner, meaner, and at the same time we have taken big, big, big challenges. And we have managed it through. So, I think for us is to continue to focus on the areas where we see the opportunity to compete and win in higher margins. But obviously the stock also thinking about long term growth and I understand that and obviously a big component of that is our Compute business, but in the end, I think the stock is heavily discounted. I'm disappointed with that. On the M&A, we have been very clear since day one that we look at assets that they are accessible that generally they are accretive or we can manage the dilution very quickly, but ultimately is, has to have strategic fit. In the context of our strategy, obviously, whether it is the edge-to-cloud architecture and pivot to know as-a-service I think the assets we have acquired makes complete sense from that vantage point and we have delivered strong results. Size is important, but I will say it's more strategic effect and obviously the return on that investment capital, which we have incredible strong discipline and where we have demonstrated at over the last two years. And so, maybe I will pass it now to Tarek because you asked the question about taking debt and buying stock and so forth. Thank you. Thanks, Toni. Can we go to the next question please? I would say Shannon a couple of things. So I think that what we have done in the last two years give us insights on how we can streamline our operations and be even more agile in focus on everything we do. And as you recall, the HPE Next was really transformative from the process standpoint as well as from the IT perspective. And I will say for the vast majority of everything was executed flawlessly and we have delivered the results with a gross margin expansion you see. As we implemented this new segmentation, now we can see through even better visibility on what else we can go and do. And as Tarek just said it right, the reality is you never stop focusing on improving your operations and because the HPE Next actually at the quarter was a cultural transformation, it give us the ability now to take further actions, which are actually I will argue timely considering the uncertainty we live in, but it's to do the hard things now as these things recovered to come on the other end even stronger than before. On the short-term actions, I think first we have to protect our employees. First and foremost, I think, it's important. And that was the first step. And then obviously that comes with the benefits and the savings, but I want to be clear, this is all about protecting our employees to make sure they don't get exposed for things they don't need to. Yes, no, that's correct. We see kind of the same thing. Obviously, some company has been aligned for some time and they have been recovering on a daily basis, the output of their facilities or their capacity. Obviously, the biggest constraint they had at the time was labor because obviously depending on the region within China, but eventually it became the entire China for the most part is the health measures and certifications that they have to go through. But in general, I will say, it progressed every single day and whether it is people coming online or people improving the output or what we're already doing. And so that's progressing. And so you have to take it day by day. And obviously, what we're doing is, because we have a global supply chain here is \u2013 China is one aspect, but also how we manage inventory and how we manage the distribution of those orders in a way we can maximize the return while these things gets back to normal. That's how we are managing it. And to be honest, we have a very stringent process with war rooms and talking to suppliers every single day. I personally have talked to at least 50 of them, myself and I have direct contact with each of them. And I will say in 2020 obviously it's a timing issue as we recover the supply chain and that is a timing from the \u2013 when we can build and ship these products obviously and also the fact that we have to rebuild some of the inventory because as the operations in China and other parts of the world maybe were impacted. We had to manage that inventory and now we have to build it back over time. Yes, I mean, first, let's start with some of the businesses I have reported earlier and Tarek provided detail. Obviously, the Intelligent Edge, we see continued momentum. That is continuing right now as we speak. We feel pretty good about that. Much of the supply chain is not gated in China for the Intelligent Edge, so that's a positive news. Then obviously on high performance computing, the demand continues to be solid. And we have a very interesting pipeline ahead of us with a unique differentiated portfolio. So the need for processing data through AI, machine learning, big data intensive loads continue to be very high. That's not stopping. As we think about these new storage platforms, particularly what I call intelligent data platform, the data growth requires that that data gets stored and gets managed and ultimately insights are extracted from it, so that's positive as well. Right now, as I said earlier, as we went through Q2, we enter with a sizable backlog because we couldn't ship it, in Q1 everything we wanted. And at the same time, we haven't seen yet outside China a significant impact, but obviously as we think about the second back of the year here, obviously we expect to things to return to a level of normalcy that eventually will allows us to continue to progress against that. That's how I see it right now. And because of everything we do both from a mix perspective with the pivot obviously as-a-service, which is a long-term opportunity and growing and the fact we're taking our own actions here with HPE Next and other ones. And that's why at this point in time, we felt comfortable in affirming the original guidance that we provided here on EPS. So we felt prudent to adjust the cash flow for the dynamics Tarek explained earlier. We don't have any specific CapEx expenditures that they are extraordinary from what we had seen before. But I want to make sure that one thing is clear, right. We are committed to maintain our credit rating. All right, thank you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much Antonio. Now let me provide more detail on our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'd be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, please note that we are now reporting results according to our new segmentation. This will provide more granular detail on the financial performance of our businesses and our progress towards becoming the edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service company. Please refer to our recently filed Form 8-K for more detailed information, which includes historical reconciliation tables for the last two years. Antonio already discussed the high-level points for the quarter, but I want to briefly reiterate the main takeaway. We are continuing to execute on our transition to higher margin and more recurring revenue areas in a challenging business environment. We also remain confident that we have the right strategy in place and are taking the right actions to lay a foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in the future. Turning to Slide 2, with the financial highlights for the quarter, despite the top line challenges from uneven demand and component supply and manufacturing constraints that I'll provide more detail on shortly, we continued to expand non-GAAP gross margins which improved by 210 basis points this year, driven primarily by portfolio mix shift, cost of services, efficiencies and commodity cost tailwinds. This gross margin expansion combined with other income and expense benefits that included record equity interest contributed from our ownership in HPC and share buybacks resulted in diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 which is up 5% year-over-year and in line with our original outlook for the quarter. On the cash front, free cash flow was a use of $185 million, which was in line with the prior year and normal seasonality. Consistent with our capital management and policy we paid $156 million in dividends and repurchased $204 million in shares. From a macro perspective, as Antonio mentioned, geopolitical factors continue to close business uncertainty, particularly in larger enterprise deals creating an uneven and unpredictable business environment. This was further exacerbated by supply constraints, both component shortages and our North American manufacturing site consolidation which affected the Compute business in particular. We expect component shortages to remain a headwind and this situation to alleviate as we progress through the year. The North American manufacturing site consolidation has created near term execution challenges that we are actively addressing and expect to have improved efficiencies and agilities in our supply chain moving forward. Adding to the uncertainty is the potential disruption to demand and supply caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The health issue is causing disruption to both supply and demand and while we cannot quantify the real impact at this time, we're monitoring the situation closely and are working with our suppliers to minimize potential impacts. We'll now move to Slide 3, that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew 4%. Our changes to North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off with double-digit growth in North America and 13% growth in overall wireless LAN product. While we continue to make relevant R&D and sales investments this year, we are also delivering significant improvement in profitability with operating margins of 9.7% up 630 basis points year-over-year.  In Compute revenue declined 15% this quarter due to the previously highlighted uneven demand environment, component supply constraints and North American manufacturing site consolidation, yet we delivered a 9.5% operating profit-margin in line with last year. With respect to units excluding Tier 1 in China, our units were up mid-single digits year-over-year and have also been growing sequentially since Q2 2019. In High Performance Compute and Mission Critical Systems, we grew revenue 6% that included our first full quarter contribution from Cray. Our HPC business has been awarded over $2 billion of business that is expected to be delivered through fiscal year 2023. We will also optimize the Cray cost envelope and expect triple digit millions in annualized run rate, cost synergies to be recognized by the end of the next fiscal year significantly adding to the operating profit and margins of HPC and MCS. Within Storage, we made progress against a competitive backdrop, maintaining flat sequential revenues with notable strength in big data growing at 45% year-over-year and Hyperconverged Infrastructure growing at 6% year-over-year this quarter. Note that this is the first quarter, we are reporting Hyperconverged Infrastructure and Storage aligned to our peers. In Advisory & Professional Services, we are reporting for the first time in our new segmentation revenue was flat and we significantly improved operating margins by 12.5 points year-over-year as we focus on eliminating unprofitable business. Operational Services, which is included across compute, HPC and MCS and Storage orders were up 1% year-over-year and revenue was down 2%. Our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per unit, was up year-over-year again in every business segment this quarter with double-digit growth in HPC and MCS, Services Intensity driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust. Within HPE financial services, we expanded our net portfolio of assets, which was up 2% in constant currency this quarter with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake and we maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again this quarter with bad debt loss ratio of 0.4% which is best-in-class within this industry. And while not shown on the slide, Communications and Media Solutions that is included in our Corporate Investment segment is a strategically important business to us providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. It is showing improved momentum. Orders in CMS were up 10% sequentially and revenue was up 2% due to improved momentum of the telco software and services business. Slide 4 shows the ARR slide that I discussed at our securities analyst meeting in October, 2019. Please reference the SAM presentation for a deep dive into what makes up the ARR. Our Q1 2020 ARR actuals came in at $511 million a 19% year-over-year growth that accelerated from last quarter. Our HPE Aruba Central platform is starting to gain traction with revenue growing triple digits year-over-year. We also continue to see strong growth in GreenLake services orders, which were up 48% year-over-year. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as-a-service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as-a-service, we are confident in achieving our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2022. Slide 5, shows our EPS performance to-date, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 in Q1 is in-line with our previously provided outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 due to disciplined execution, expanding gross margins and favorable other income and expense. This represents year-over-year growth of 5% also, please note our OI&E performance in Q1 of fiscal year 2020 does not change our fiscal year 2020 OI&E outlook. As we foreshadowed during last October, Securities Analyst Meeting, we continue to expect OI&E to be a $0.03 to $0.05 per share headwind in fiscal year 2020. Turning to gross margins on Slide 6, we continue to deliver a significant year-over-year gross margin expansion that was up 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2% as we shifted to a higher margin offerings like the Intelligent Edge with Aruba Central Hyperconverged Infrastructure, the addition of Cray and commodity cost tailwinds.  Moving to Slide 7, we have continued to improve operating profits since the beginning of Q1 of fiscal year 2018, while making strategic investments in R&D and sales to support long term profitable growth. In Q1 of fiscal year 2020 we're now consolidating a full quarter of additional operating expenses from the Cray acquisition that will be optimized going forward. Furthermore, given the additional uncertainty in the business environment introduced this quarter, we are taking near term actions that will enable us to protect and expand our profitability in fiscal year 2020, while continuing to make critical long term investments. As Antonio mentioned, we would extend the HPE Next program into fiscal year 2021 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. Turning to cash flow on Slide 8, operating cash flow declined with revenue $461 million year-over-year. Free cash flow for Q1 was in-line with normal seasonality at negative $185 million in-line with the prior year, thanks to planned net CapEx benefits in the quarter. Please remember our normal seasonality is for cash to be used in the first half and then we generate significant amounts of free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year. Now as a reminder on Slide 9, we maintained a solid balance sheet with our cash flow generation and we have a disciplined returns based process for evaluating investments and capital returns. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating that is evidenced by our current operating net cash position. Consistent with our capital return commitments, in Q1 we returned $360 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As part of our capital allocation framework, we also target value enhancing acquisitions to improve our competitive positioning and to accelerate our strategy of pivoting to as-a-service that provides us with higher levels of recurring revenue and profitability. As with any investment we consider, we follow a rigorous evaluation process, cognizant of size, valuation, financial impact, such as accretion, dilution, and strategic fit. Now, turning to our outlook on Slide 10, as discussed, we are in an increasingly uneven business environment, but at this point we're comfortable maintaining our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP EPS outlook of a $1.78 to a $1.94 given the cost actions we plan to take and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time. However, there's still considerable uncertainty in the short term due to the unknown potential impacts from the coronavirus, so we're not in a position to provide our second quarter outlook. From a cash flow perspective and given our negative cash conversion cycle, we expect some current year impact on working capital receivables with elongated sales cycles persisting and the need to build inventory levels due to the supply chain constraints. Consequently, we feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year 2020 free cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. We remain committed to our previously announced capital management policy of returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders and now expect to be at the higher end of that range for fiscal year 2020. Overall, we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities within an uneven environment and introduce new challenges this quarter. We're taking the appropriate actions to navigate the near term uncertainty while executing against our vision and strategy that is really resonating with customers. We will continue to shift our portfolio to higher margin software defined solutions and focus on delivering our edge to cloud platform, offering our full portfolio as a service by 2022. This will ultimately drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long term. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you. Okay. Good afternoon Katy. Thank you for the question. With respect to how much those short term disruptions have accounted for our revenue performance, I would say quite a lot. There are three things that affected our revenue performance. These are the macro environment softness. The second thing is supply chain constraints. And the third one is also the manufacturing north consolidation in North America. We've taken steps to address what's under our control. Nonetheless, coronavirus has effected the tail end of the quarter and injected a new degree of uncertainty. And when you look at the revenue performance of the company, most of the decline came in the Compute category that we referred to in our new segmentation and that decline has a lot to do with what you referred to from a supply chain standpoint. Okay. So let me start by the second part of your question, which is how much of an impact will the coronavirus have on our business? Well, first as we already flagged the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is our priority and out of abundance of caution for them, we've made the decision to cancel or postpone most of the HPE sponsors events through April. And unfortunately, this is also closing supply and demand disruptions and effecting our revenue profile. The outbreak at the end of January, started to impact the component manufacturing and resulted in constrained supply and higher quarter-end backlog worldwide. And we have been in constant contact with our suppliers and are establishing specific mitigation and recovery plans. So, this is affecting our revenue profile for the full year. And this is why we're not guiding in the short term and relative to what we said at SAM where we were experiencing \u2013 we were thinking we would be returning to growth in fiscal year 2020. I don't think that it is likely at this stage that we were going fiscal year 2020 as a whole for the fiscal year, but we do anticipate recovery of those supply chain constraints over time and face easier comps during the course of the year. Sure Toni. Good afternoon and thanks for the question. I don't have the book-to-bill but I can tell you we entered Q2 which is the quarter we're in with higher backlog than we anticipated and definitely it is more on the elevated side. And so that's true for Compute and as well a carryover for high performance compute, which are the core of that product. Toni is the legacy HPE Apollo. So we enter Q2 with a higher elevated backlog than we have seen. I don't see yet let me qualify this outside China. I haven't seen yet a significant impact on demand so far. Definitely in China, as you know we have a different setup with our H3C partnership there. And you should expect a short term impact in China. But right now they are working it through it. But I will say right now we haven't seen a significant impact. If anything actually creates short term opportunities. I can tell you because of the coronavirus we see customers coming to us and say, can you ship this product to take care of the fact that my employees are not going to be at work. We see some demand in specific areas of our workload optimized solutions. And as I said in my opening remarks, we do have as an awarded business, which obviously we have to build and ship more than $2 billion in HPC business that we have to ship over the next several quarters in the next two years. And that business is doing very well from my vantage point, but it is obviously segregate in two different segments, compute and on the other hand, HPC and Mission Critical. Yes. So, Toni, I would say, Antonio answered the question on the stock. I would simply point to you at the performance of the values part of our business, the Intelligent Edge, which has outperformed the sector quite substantially this quarter. What's the value of that? If you look at our storage business, which has done better than most of the players in the market and is of the same size as a very large pure-play listed company, what's the value of that? And if you look at our HPC and MCS business and the $2 billion of backlog contracted revenues that would come in, what's the value of that? And then you have to look at other players in the sector and compare our compute business to them and see that also for those players that compute business is valued negatively from an equity standpoint, but it does generate cash and we have to figure that out. Finally, let me finish by saying HPC, the production was the value of that. It's a listed company and it's pretty substantial. So I'll let you conclude whether the stock is beaten down or not and how much is beaten down and probably in your own question you have the answer. Well, expected acquisitions \u2013 sorry, go ahead. So the thing that we \u2013 let me just finish up answering the other part and I'll come back to your question on buying share. With respect to acquisitions, Antonio answered very, very clearly. We remain disciplined in that field when we're not going to look at acquisitions that don't fit our investment criteria from an accretion dilutions standpoint. It's very, very important. We do that. A&PS, specifically for A&PS, it's a very strategic business that pulls a lot of revenue and profits in other parts of the organization and it's essential for enabling the as-a-service pivot. Now coming back on to your question with respect to aggressive buybacks, we did in the past two years execute a $7 billion capital return program to shareholders. We returned 2.9 billion by way of dividends and 4.1 by way of buybacks. And what we did flag at SAM is the fact that we are going to continue to return capital to shareholders in line with our free cash flow generation capacity. We're not going to deviate from this because it's important that we continue to think about the long-term value of those businesses and each one of those businesses has its own investment profile and needs to be therefore catered for. Sure. So thank you Shannon for this question. When first and foremost you may recall when I joined HPE 14 months ago, I use the expression that SAM in 2018 that looking at our cost structure was akin to a fitness exercise. And it's always important that we look at our cost structure based on the revenue profile that we have and it's no different right now. Specifically to HPE Next, we are continuing the implementation of the program in that context where we have to align our cost structure to the new business climate that exists. We're not announcing a new restructuring plan. And what is happening is that through the implementation of the new segmentation, we have identified new savings opportunities in each of the businesses and we'll continue to streamline our operations in that context. Yes, thank you, Wamsi. So you remember last year, this time of the year, we did say that from a free cash flow standpoint, working capital would be a contributor to cash. And that is what happened last year. This year, we have attained the point where our cash conversion cycle is negative. And whilst we do deliver the EPS guide and we confirmed it per Antonio, the drop in revenue will inevitably have a drag on the free cash flow generation. That is because we have a negative free cash flow cycle. So the way cash tracks earnings is a combination of what happens in the P&L at EPS level, but also the working capital components that comes with a P&L and the revenue from the accounts receivable side and also the fact that we need to build inventory to be able to cater for the supply chain shortages that we explained. That is what is behind the difference between the P&L EPS performance and the free cash flow guide that we put forward. Look, net CapEx for this year is not a particularly large number. In this first half of the year, we have benefited from in plan sales that have reduced our overall CapEx consumption. And we think that from a CapEx standpoint we're in line with prior years. I don't see beyond the first quarter performance, a significant uptick in CapEx this year. Well, it really depends on what you borrow the money for to some extent, right. And that's a question. But if you really want to look at how do we maintain our investment grade rating and what would be our borrowing capacity maintaining than the investment grade rating, it's probably around the $5 billion mark."

And for those of you who attended our virtual Security Analyst Meeting last month, thank you. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss how our edge-to-cloud strategy position us to capture an expanded market opportunity and accelerate shareholder value creation. HPE ended fiscal year 2021 with strong momentum. Customers are responding to our edge-to-cloud value proposition as evidenced by the record demand for our solutions. Demand accelerated in the second half of the year, driving fiscal year 2021 orders growth of 16% year-over-year. Revenue of $27.8 billion in fiscal year 2021 grew in line with our long-term outlook, up 1% year-over-year. In fiscal year 2021, we executed very well, which enabled us to exceed our commitments across all financial metrics, even with a substantial order backlog. Our as-a-Service Annualized Revenue Run Rate or ARR of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. We significantly improved our gross and operating margins, which increased our fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP operating profit by 25% year-over-year. We delivered fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.96, up 27% year-over-year. And we generated the fiscal year 2021 free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up $1 billion year-over-year, which translates to growth of 177%. This was a very strong performance, and it was particularly impressive against the backdrop of industry-wide supply constraints, which continue to challenge our ability to convert orders to revenue as quickly as we would like. We have a world-class global operations team that continues to work closely with a long-standing diverse network of suppliers. We continue to take proactive inventory measures to better position us to deliver against this robust customer demand. Our results in Q4 strengthened the momentum we have as we enter fiscal year 2022. Increased demand in the quarter drove orders growth of 28% year-over-year, with particular strength in our as-a-Service orders, which grew an impressive 114% year-over-year, including a large network as-a-Service win. We also saw record levels of orders in key growth areas, including Intelligent Edge, High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence businesses. We delivered $7.4 billion in total Q4 revenue, which was up 7% sequentially and above normal sequential seasonality. We expanded our gross and operating margins, increasing our Q4 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share by 27% year-over-year. And we generated Q4 free cash flow of $94 million, in line with the outlook we provided at the end of Q3. Tarek will take you through our quarterly results in detail, but I would like to spend a little more time putting a full fiscal year in context for you. Our fiscal year 2021 results proved the relevance of our strategy to customers and the traction of our transformation to become the S2 cloud company. As we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, HPE is at the center of several compelling megatrends; the explosion of data at the edge, the mandate for a cloud experience everywhere, and the need to extract value from data to generate insights. HPE is differentiated edge-to-cloud strategy uniquely positions us to capitalize on these trends and capture growing profitable markets. Our solutions and services help customers overcome the challenges of multi-generation IT and enable them to access, control and maximize the value of all their workloads and data everywhere. We are executing with focus and speed to deliver against our vision and strategy. We are making strategic investments and taking deliberate steps to continue to shift our business. And as I have said previously, this transformation is my number one priority, and I'm proud of the progress we have made in fiscal year 2021. Our Intelligent Edge business grew fiscal year 2021 revenue 13% year-over-year, with orders exceeding for the first time $4 billion. Customer demand was up strong double digits year-over-year as more customers look for ways to create new digital experiences at the edge and capitalize on the data generated there. But the industry-wide component shortages kept us for converting our full order momentum to revenue in Q4, and we enter fiscal year 2022 with record levels of backlog. Our market leadership at the Edge remained very strong. HPE was positioned as the leader in - one of the leaders in the Magic Quadrant Gartner provides for wireless access network edge infrastructure, which is notable because HP is only one of the two companies to be positioned in the Leader Quadrant four years in a row. We continue to drive strong innovation in this business. In Q4, we introduced the industry-first distributed services switch, which brings software-defined services and security right to where the data is created in process. Developed in partnership with Pensando, this solution eliminates legacy appliances and whole software needed to build the hybrid cloud demand - demanded by modern applications and IT organizations. In Q4, we closed the largest network as-a-Service deal in HP history to help a large US retailer enhance its customer and employee experience throughout the stores. In addition, the Major League soccer franchise, FC Cincinnati, standardized on Aruba at the TQL Stadium to deliver next-generation digital cashless, counterless fund and event experiences. The franchise deployed an end-to-end Aruba Edge Services platform network at its new 26,000-seat stadium to power this game day and special event experiences. Orders of HPE's High Performance Compute and AI offerings were also up strong double digits year-over-year. This record level of demand has generated an order book of awarded contracts now at $2.7 billion, excluding the important $2 billion win with the U.S. National Security Agency. HPE expanded our number one market position in HPC with 37% market share as of calendar Q2 data, which is more than 14 points above the closest competitor. And according to the list of the top 500 supercomputers released just two weeks ago, 33 of the top 100 most powerful supercomputers in the world were built by HPE. This is more than any company. At the end of Q4, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, NERSC at Berkeley Lab accepted the first phase of the promoter supercomputer. Powered by the HPE Cray EX system, Bermuda introduced a new generation of supercomputing capabilities to more than 8,000 scientists performing research for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science. HPE is uniquely positioned to bring the AI, deep learning and data analytics capabilities of our most advanced supercomputers to mainstream enterprises through the HPE GreenLake platform. In Q4, we announced that Eni, a global energy company, selected HP GreenLake to upgrade its existing HPE supercomputer. Through HPE GreenLake, Eni can accelerate discover - discovery of new energy sources with more accurate modeling and simulations, as well as become more sustainable by monitor utilization and energy consumption within an - as-a-Service solution. We continue to strengthen our Compute and Storage businesses where we saw strong orders and profitability in fiscal year 2021. In Compute, orders increased more than 10% in fiscal year '21 and we delivered operating margins of 10.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. We are making bold moves to transform our Storage business into a cloud-native data services business, which resulted in a high single-digit order growth and gross margin expansion, up 130 basis points year-over-year. And we continue to see high services attach rate, helping enable HP Pointnext orders to increase mid-single digits in fiscal year '21. This contributed to the overall performance of HPE Pointnext, which ended fiscal year 2021 with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 of revenues, highlighting the potential for future revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. In fiscal year 2021, we generated a strong momentum in our transformation to an as-a-Service company. Our company as-a-Service orders increased 61% year-over-year, with HPE GreenLake orders increasing 46% year-over-year. Our as-a-Service annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. The growth of our ARR is particularly noteworthy because, this recurring revenue stream is high quality and high margin. During our Security Analyst Meeting last month, Tarek shared that more than 60% of our ARR mix is software and services. And we believe that portion will grow to more than three quarters in the next three years. Our ARR gross margins are well above our corporate average gross margins today. And the addition of high-value software content will drive margins even higher. Our pivot to an as-a-Service company is enabled by HPE Financial Services, which increased fiscal year 2021 financing volume 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth within HPE GreenLake. We continue to advance our leadership in our HP GreenLake offering. In September, we introduced HP GreenLake for data protection, which are cloud services designed to protect data across edge-to-cloud overcome brands of war attacks and deliver rapid data recovery. This new set of solutions marks our entry into the growing data protection as-a-Service market. Our acquisition of Zerto enabled us to add market-leading data protection to our cloud services portfolio to help enterprises take cyber threats and ransomware attacks head on. We also launched HP GreenLake for data analytics, which includes the industry-first, unified modern hybrid analytics and Data Lake platform. This strategically important solution positions HPE in the growing Unifi analytics market and helps customers accelerate modernization initiatives for all data across edge-to-cloud. We continue to see incredible response to our HP GreenLake offering. We added more than 300 new GreenLake customers during fiscal year 2021, bringing our customer count to more than 1,250. New GreenLake logos represent an increasing share of orders with approximately one quarter of Q4 GreenLake orders coming from new customers. Today, more than 900 partners sell HPE GreenLake, one of the largest, partner of ecosystems selling as-a-Service offerings in the industry. We added more than $1.5 billion of GreenLake total contract value over the last year, bringing the total to more than $5.7 billion. Examples of new GreenLake logos includes family estates, the second largest family-owned winery in the world which adopted HPE GreenLake through our channel partner PKA technologies to add flexibility and scale, its capacity to meet the increasing demand of Auto - N&F Automations. The HPE GreenLake solution powers the one in this automated warehouse, where approximately 60 different types of wines that produce mobile package and prepare for shipping while reducing overall IT costs. We also won a deal with ONGC, India's largest Oil and Natural Gas Company, which is used in the HP GreenLake platform to make one of the largest SAP implementations in the world more manageable and flexible. Our Q4 rounded out an impressive year for HPE. And I'm proud of all we've had accomplished. We have made incredible progress in transforming to become the edge-to-cloud leader, executing on our strategy to help customers in truly differentiated ways and position ourselves for sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. At the same time, we have advanced our ESG initiatives, which in Q4 earned us a position on a highly competitive Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, placing in the 98 percentile. We exceeded our commitments in fiscal year 2021, and our momentum is strong as we enter fiscal year 2022 with a strategy more relevant to customers than ever before and a sharp focus on execution. With that, I will turn it over to Tarek to share additional details about the quarter. Tarek, over to you.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. And as usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key fiscal year 2021 highlights on Slides 1 and 2, so now let me discuss our Q4 performance, starting with Slide 3. I am very pleased to report that we continue to see unprecedented demand across all our businesses with robust order growth, up 28% year-over-year. Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q4 revenues of $7.4 billion, up 7% from the prior quarter above normal sequential seasonality and this despite increased supply chain challenges that we foreshadowed at SAM last month. It's also worth highlighting that $7.4 billion of revenue represents the highest level since Q1 of fiscal year 2019, well before the pandemic. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, which was up 230 basis points from the prior year. And this was driven by our deliberate actions to shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline and cost takeout. As previously indicated, gross margins were pressured from prior quarter levels due to an increasing industry-wide shortages of certain components that have resulted in extended lead times and higher commodity costs underpinning backlogged orders. We continue to take proactive inventory measures and display healthy price discipline to minimize the impact of recent disruptions. We expect this dynamic supply chain situation to last well into calendar year 2022. We also continue to invest in high gross margin-rich areas of our portfolio. We've made investments in our overall go-to-market to accelerate our growth and our shift to an as-a-Service model. Even with these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 16% year-over-year increase in operating profit. Within other income and expense, we benefited from further strong gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio, an outstanding operational performance in HPC that I will address in more detail later. With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, up 27% from the prior year and at the high end of our outlook range for Q4. Excluding $2.2 billion of after-tax proceeds received from Oracle satisfaction of the judgment in the Itanium litigation, Q4 cash flow from operations was $784 million, and free cash flow was $94 million. For fiscal year 2021, this brings our total cash flow from operations to $3.7 billion, up $1.5 billion from the prior year, and our free cash flow to $1.6 billion, up $1 billion from the prior year driven primarily by an increase in earnings. Our strong execution and cost optimization and resource allocation program has effectively put us one year ahead of schedule with respect to delivering our previous free cash flow targets.  Finally, the strength of our cash flow has positioned us to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $157 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q1 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in January. We also reinstated our share repurchase program in Q4 buying $213 million in shares, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation and our view that the stock is undervalued. Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our accelerating as-a-Service business. We have made significant progress over the last year by adding over 300 new enterprise GreenLake customers to over 1,250 today and increasing our TCV by over $1.5 billion to our current lifetime TCV of over $5.7 billion. For Q4 specifically, our ARR was $796 million, which was up 36% year-over-year as reported and total as-a-Service orders were up 114% year-over-year, which represents an acceleration from Q3, demonstrating the strong momentum we are experiencing in this business. It's also important to remember the incremental disclosure we provided at SAM 2021, highlighting the significant proportion of software and services in our offerings that together make up more than 60% of the ARR mix today. We expect this mix percentage to expand to more than 75% by fiscal year 2024 as we add more software capabilities driving further gross margin improvement. Overall, based on strong momentum this year, I'm very happy with how this business is progressing, which gives us confidence to increase our ARR growth targets by 5 points to a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 5. Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total company revenue, generated record levels of orders, up strong double-digits. In the Intelligent Edge, revenue grew 2% year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal year 2021 was up 13%. Demand continued unabated in Q4 with order growth up over 50% year-over-year, but the component shortages we foreshadowed at SAM were more pronounced in our Aruba business. Additionally, our Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up trip triple digits year-over-year, significantly contributing to our ARR. We delivered a multimillion-dollar NaaS, Network-as-a-Service deal in Q4 for a large US customer, which represented more than 800 basis points headwind in the short-term to Aruba revenue in Q4, but will help our long-term financial profile in the business. Aruba Services also continued to grow strongly, up high single digits. Looking forward, we expect it will take some time for supply chain challenges to ease, but we finished fiscal year 2021 with over $4 billion in orders which will give us strong momentum through fiscal year 2022. In HPC & AI, demand strengthened even further with another record level of orders. Revenue grew 35% sequentially and was flat year-over-year with a difficult compare. We did have customer acceptances of some large contracts get pushed out into fiscal year 2022. And we now have $2.7 billion of awarded contracts in addition to the $2 billion contract awarded by the NSA, giving us confidence for next year and beyond. We expect robust revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 to get us back within the range of our original long term 8% to 12% CAGR outlook. In Compute, order growth was up strong double digits. Revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting above normal sequential seasonality and was up double digits year-over-year when normalizing for the Q4 FY 2020 backlog. Operating margins of 9.4% were up 280 basis points from prior year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. Within Storage, order growth accelerated and was up double digits year-over-year. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter ahead of normal sequential seasonality, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. All-flash arrays grew 7% year-over-year, led by Primera, up strong double digits. Nimble grew 4% year-over-year, with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double digits year-over-year. Storage operating profit margin was 13.8%, reflecting OpEx investments to continue driving product mix shift towards more software-rich platforms, including our cloud data services. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, orders accelerated and were up high single digits in Q4 and up mid-single digits for fiscal year 2021. Most importantly, revenue also grew as reported overall for fiscal year 2021, the first time in several years. This is, again, very important, as we enter fiscal year 2022 with strong momentum in our most profitable business. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 18% year-over-year, driven by strong double-digit growth in GreenLake. Revenue was up 3% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Our profitability is also benefiting from higher residual values realization and lower borrowing costs, as we continue to securitize our U.S. portfolio via the ABS market. Our operating margin was 14.1%, up 630 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 23.8% is well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum throughout fiscal year 2021. As mentioned previously, Q4 revenue of $7.4 billion is the highest level we've delivered since Q1 2019. With a strong demand environment, our strategic business mix shift and execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we increased our Q4 non-GAAP EPS to $0.52, up 27% year-over-year. Turning to Slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q4 of 33%. While rates were impacted as expected sequentially from the supply chain challenges previously discussed, we expanded gross margins up 230 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses. In total, in fiscal year 2021, we delivered nearly $900 million of incremental gross profit. Moving forward, we will face lingering supply chain challenges in the near term, but longer term, structural gross margins will improve from continuous mix shift towards the intelligent edge or IP storage Green Lake and all of our as-a-Service offerings. Moving to Slide 8. You can see we have utilized some of the incremental gross profit to make targeted growth investments while simultaneously expanding non-GAAP operating profit margins. We have increased our investment levels in R&D to fuel our long-term innovation engine and still selling costs to accelerate our growth and higher shift to our as-a-Service pivot. Even with these investments to drive long-term growth, we delivered operating margins in Q4 of 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year. On Slide 9, we want to highlight our unique setup in China through our investment in HPC that has and continues to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. Our investment and commercial agreement gives us a route-to-market in the second largest, fastest-growing IT market in the world. As you know, we do not consolidate revenue and operating profit from HPC, but recognize our 49% share of HPC's earnings through the equity interest statement line on our P&L as part of other income and expense. HPC has delivered outstanding operational performance throughout the year and generated $257 million of equity interest in fiscal year '21, which was up 21% from the prior year. This makes our business in China a very large contributor to our P&L, one that no other multinational has been able to replicate. Turning to Slide 10. We finished fiscal year '21 generating $3.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.6 billion of free cash flow, and this excluding, obviously, the $2.2 billion of after-tax, cash received from Oracle satisfaction of the Itanium litigation. Free cash flow was up $1 billion year-over-year and is $600 million more than the midpoint of our outlook at the start of fiscal year '20, primarily driven by increased earnings. Our cash flow profile is becoming more predictable and aligned to profitability as our restructuring costs diminish, and we grow our as-a-Service business beginning to recognize more deferred revenues from software and services. Moving on to Slide 11. We have made further progress enhancing our balance sheet strength with a strong free cash flow and payment from Oracle. Following the receipt of the cash from the Itanium litigation, we redeemed early, our $1 billion 4.65% coupon outstanding 2024 notes and this in a positive NPV transaction that is net debt-neutral. The  premium paid was a GAAP-only expense in Q4, and we will realize meaningful interest expense savings over the next three years. We are now in an operating company net cash position of $1.8 billion. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity available to balance long-term growth investments with consistent return of capital to our shareholders. Now, turning to our outlook on Slide 12. At our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '22, and I would like to encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. Having said that, let me reiterate the drill down into a few key components. We expect fiscal year '22 revenue growth in constant currency of 3% to 4%. As discussed, the supply chain environment remains very dynamic, and we expect component shortages with increased commodity costs, expedite and shipping fees to last for the next few quarters impacting near-term revenue and gross margins. In a nutshell, we expect to have more of a back-end loaded year in fiscal year '22 with the supply chain risk that we discussed reflected in our fiscal year '22 guidance. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.96 to $2.10 and free cash flow to be $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We expect free cash flow to be more in line with historical seasonality where the second half is a stronger generator of cash than the first half. Now specific to Q1 revenue, given the very strong backlog balanced by supply chain constraints, we expect revenue to be in line with normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q4 of fiscal year 2021 and are comfortable with current consensus levels. We also expect gross margins to be pressured in the short-term given supply chain. As a result, for Q1 2022, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.19 to $0.27 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42 to $0.50. So overall, I'm very proud of our progress throughout our strong fiscal year 2021. As Antonio said, we exceeded all our key financial targets in fiscal year 2021, often by a significant margin. The demand environment has been incredibly strong across our business with acceleration in the second half of fiscal year 2021; demonstrating that our edge-to-cloud strategy is working well and that we are entering fiscal year 2022 with strong momentum. We are now well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us and deliver against our fiscal year 2022 outlook. Now with that, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I wanted to dig a little bit more into the as-a-Service performance. Obviously, orders are extremely strong during the quarter. How much of that was from the one-time - not one-time, but from the large contract signed, how should we think about the longer-term growth potential, how it flows through the model as we look to the next year or two? And I don't know maybe if you can give a little bit more on the composition of the as-a-Service, is there any one product, or service that's really driving that business at this point in time? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thank you, Shannon. I will start, and obviously, I would like Tarek to comment on the model in itself. Listen, we are super proud of the momentum we have in the market with HPE GreenLake. We believe it's truly differentiated in the market. And as we show you some, two-thirds of that is already in the software and services, and we believe in three years, will be more than 75% of it, which obviously come with high margin and more durable revenue in many ways. What customers like about the model is the ability to procure everything from Edge to cloud from one integrated platform. And it's not just what I call Infrastructure as-a-Service or hardware as-a-Service on premises in a colo or at the Edge is the fact that they can consume anything from network as-a-Service, subscription to Aruba products to what I call private cloud to data services, which is part of the transformation we are driving in our storage portfolio. And as we said, $5.7 billion already in total contract value and in Q4, the growth was accelerated by a number of new logos, which again, we added 300 in fiscal year 2021, which drove the order growth to 114%, okay? So when you think about this, we have been delivering 40, 50, 60 and in Q4 it was 114%. And Aruba is one key component of that. But what we see now, Shannon, is also the Storage part of it is growing very rapidly. And that's why I'm excited about next year because we're also adding new capabilities to that platform, particularly in the early part of 2022. So overall, I will say this has been a home run. We believe we have years of advantage. We are disclosing all our numbers, as you see, versus some of our competitors are not sharing anything as far as I can see. And what I'm really pleased is that we have now 900 partners selling with us, co-selling, and you will see their offers in our platform here soon because that's the way we drive, fully push from both sides, direct and indirect. So Tarek, do you want to talk about the modeling?\nTarek Robbiati: So yes, Sharon, I mean, Antonio said already quite a few things. So first and foremost is one - the first - this first and largest network as-a-Service contract contributed to orders in Q4 substantially, but did not contribute to the ARR because the revenue will be recognized over time. But notwithstanding that, the ARR, if you really look at our ARR progression quarter-after-quarter in fiscal year 2021, it's outstanding. We did $649 million in Q1 of ARR, grew that to $678 million in Q2, $705 million in Q3 and now approaching $800 million, $796 million to be precise in Q4. So the momentum in this business is extremely strong, and there isn't a particular business unit that is contributing. We're executing an integrated strategy that is about edge, cloud and data. Right now, the main contributors are the various parts of the organization that fit these three pillars. Aruba is one of them. The Storage business unit is another one. We will also continue to expand our as-a-Service offerings in HPC and AI because we see a tremendous opportunity there. And the future will tell us how big that opportunity will be for us. But we firmly believe in it.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you, Shannon. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Antonio, I'm trying to reconcile your comments around strong backlog, which you guys have been very consistent about. Relative to what happened in the quarter and the guide here for - in the near-term, it sounds like component shortages were a major reason for that, but you're maintaining your full year guide. So just trying to understand like what gives you the confidence that these will resolve itself? And what gives you the confidence that this is - this back-end loaded year is going to pan out as you're seeing it now?\nAntonio Neri: Sure. Well, I mean, if you look at our results, right, once - right, so we grew orders. Total company orders 16% year-over-year, but our revenue in actual dollars was up 3%. Obviously, there is a big divergence there between 16% and 3%, right? And that's driven by the supply availability. Despite the fact that we continue, I think, do a great job navigating through the challenge. And the one area I'm really particularly pleased, one say is the fact that linearity in the business in the way we approach customers that book orders is now more front end and back end in the quarter itself. I always talk about quarters having 13 weeks and what is amazing to me in the last couple of quarters, the bookings have been more on the front end than the back end, which allows us, actually. It's a little bit counterintuitive if you think about it. The more orders are - bring early on, the more I can convert despite the supply chain challenges because I have more time and more velocity, if you will. So listen, as Tarek said, and I said in my remarks, short-term, we're going continue to navigate. This is an industry-wide challenge. But we're very confident with the actions we are taking ourselves. And the fact of the matter is that that backlog is very durable. People asked me early on, have you seen cancellation? I can tell you right now, zero, no cancellations whatsoever. And the orders coming in every day, every week is incredibly strong. So, we have to navigate the next quarter or two. And then based on our understanding and the work we have done with our suppliers, the second half will be better. And then also remember, we have, I think, world-class capabilities, both on the supply chain operations and our engineering capabilities to be able to adjust components based on the bump. And then also, remember, a big chunk of the backlog is related to acceptances in the customer base with HPC, which is already built and shipped. But as you know, we cannot recognize revenue until fully accepted. This quarter, we recognized a customer, which had a large order in HPC. But remember, in 2022, we have the large exascale deals and one of them is going to be very important for us as we think about the back half of the year. So, that's why Tarek and I are very confident in that 3% to 4% guidance. And let's remind ourselves in the 3% to 4% guidance, we have 1 to 1.5 points of headwind because of the transition towards as a service, right, which is great, is durable is long-term growth. And so you normalize for that, it's more like 5% to 5.5%, if you will. And then on top of that, you have to add the currency, which obviously is a headwind in the sense that the 3% to 4% is constant currency. So, if you are all of that, we are more than like in the 7% to 8% growth. And remember that Q4 was a $7.4 billion, the largest quarter despite the supply chain going all the way back to 2019.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you, Wamsi. Operator?\nOperator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. On this 28% order growth, I'm wondering if you could unpack maybe some of the factors that contributed to it. And what I'm thinking about is, is there an aspect here of customers trying to get in ahead of price increases or an aspect of customers placing orders earlier because of extended lead-times. If you could just help us understand what you see contributing to that massive number? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Well, glad you call it massive because we agree with you. It's a strong momentum and clearly was stronger in Q3 and Q4 than the first half of the year. I think it's a combination, Simon. I think that obviously, there is a market demand out there driven by the recovery in the economy. I think customers also worry about the impact of the supply that we'll have in the short, mid-term. But on the same time, we should not underestimate the power of our portfolio because I got this question earlier on, you take this double-bookings? Perhaps in the commodity space, but not on the value space. We believe Aruba is unique and differentiated. This is not something you can swap by somebody else. And that business, it's a true mobile-first cloud-native approach, which drives a unique experience at the edge. And that's - the momentum has happened for a number of quarters now despite the short-term challenge of supply. HPC, we are the clear number one leader with 35% market share and 14 points advantage against the second competitor. And then the supercomputer, I don't think there's anybody that can match us. 35% of the top 100 supercomputers are all back and enterprise, and we're going to deliver the extra scale in 2022. And GreenLake, again, the question about GreenLake is a true hybrid differentiated offerings from edge to cloud. And I think that has been in the making now for a number of years, and the pipeline is just amazing to me. And now we are getting better and better in closing deals faster and deploying the solution, which, remember, it's not just deploying it, it's also driving usage. And so it's a combination of growth in the current installed base and new logos, which I commented 300 new logos. So we believe there may be some in the commodity space, but the rest is because of our edge-to-cloud offering, which is resonating in the market, and we believe that's going to accelerate in 2022.\nOperator: The next question is from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKyle McNealy: Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could drill down a bit more in the areas that are driving your Compute segment results? They were a bit higher than we expected and certainly the consensus, I get that there's some FX in there. You quantified that. But are there segments of the market that have been stronger for you that you can contextualize? And can you give us a sense for unit growth for Compute? And maybe a split of how much ASP growth comes from memory versus product mix versus general price increases? Thanks.\nAntonio Neri: Go ahead, Tarek, and then I will comment on the end, on the back end.\nTarek Robbiati: Sure, Kyle. So in terms of customer segments, the demand remains very strong across the board and large enterprise customers, SaaS companies, telcos, and we see very robust demand from all these customers. With respect to unit growth, units have been roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, but the right comparison is a normalized year-over-year comparison. If you normalize for Q4 2020 units that were sold, but for orders that were generated in Q1 and Q2, you remember the dynamics of fiscal year 2020, units have grown 13% Q4 2021 over normalized Q4 2020. Which is an excellent result for us. We're very pleased with it. And this comes together with very strong disciplines from our management team there in the compute space. We've executed a number of price increases ahead of price hikes of commodities and logistics costs coming up by way of expedite fees and container costs that have been rising quite dramatically, as you know. The AUP have risen overall at about 3%. When you think about this on a normalized basis, and we feel pretty good about our performance in Compute, both on the P, the price and the quantity. We feel that there is still strong demand moving forward, particularly in fiscal year 2022 with the order book that we have been able to generate and the backlog that we have in that segment. But that comment that I just made is true and very true for Aruba where we feel a very strong order demand in Aruba and also in storage. So we feel pretty good about fiscal year 2022, as Antonio commented a moment ago.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Just to add a few comments. In simple terms, this is the way to think about it. So first of all, our compute orders were up more than 10% in 2021. Our units normalized for - remember, the 2020 backlog, if you remember, when the COVID started, we had a $750 million backlog which we cleared $500 million in Q3 2020 and $250 million in Q4. When you normalize for that, units are up. Obviously, AUPs are up for two reasons; number one, cost; and number two, structural changes. As we introduce the next-generation of our Compute platform, call it, Gen 10.5 and 11 you're going to see more options and more density in those platform, which drives structural changes, which are - we believe those structural changes are sustainable, irrespective of the changes of the commodity cost. And then if you listen to what we said in 2020 and 2021 are pivot to different segments of the market, we said we want to focus on growing segments of the market, while enterprise is still super important. SaaS, Telco and Edge are three growing markets where we have been benefit from. Telco obviously with a 5G deployment our Intelligent Edge Solutions at the Edge, particularly in retail, manufacturing and hospitality, and then obviously, the focus on the SaaS, which is not the big cloud providers, but Software-as-a-Service companies, which are driving quite significant growth. And then we have our own value of built into the platform with silicon root of trust and manageability. And all of this, by the way, is all now being delivered to HPE GreenLake as well. So GreenLake is a force multiplier for the growth in Compute, because the more we sell as-a-Service, the more recurring revenue in Compute we're going to have over time. So I hope that answers the question.\nOperator: The next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: Yes. Thank you. Antonio, how should we reconcile your commentary on incredibly strong order growth in just about every business and orders up 16% in fiscal 2021 with the 3% revenue growth that you reported last year, and the similar 3% to 4% revenue growth for fiscal 2022? Is there a point that these really strong orders convert to a meaningful acceleration in revenue growth? And if so, which quarter of fiscal 2022, do you think we could see that backlog flush?\nAntonio Neri: Yes, I'll let Tarek start, and then I will add a few comments.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. So Katy, the most important comment I would make to you with respect to orders is that the acceleration of orders manifested itself very strongly in the second half of fiscal year 2021. And it's continuing from here on, the demand remains very strong. We're getting orders every day, and the linearity is better even this quarter than it was in the prior quarter last year. The trough for our business was hit in the second quarter of 2020 ever since revenue has been edging up. And we're now at a point in Q4 2021, where we hit the revenue that is at the high watermark that is on the par with the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 roughly. We do see the acceleration of the revenue growth year-over-year manifesting itself on a full year basis. But timing-wise, we did say in my script and hopefully, it was understood that, the fiscal year 2022 is going to be back-end loaded. Why is that? It's because we still have to navigate supply chain constraints and those supply chain constraints are probably not going to abate before the end of fiscal year 2022 and most likely calendar year 2022. Specifically for Q1, we're comfortable with current consensus levels on revenue and which also imply, as I said in my script, a seasonal decline of mid-single digits. But when you really look at the overall trend, year-over-year from now on, we do expect an acceleration of revenue that will be dampened a little bit by supply chain constraint that we're navigating day-after-day, month-after-month and quarter-after-quarter.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Katy, I think in addition to what Tarek, first of all, I don't see the demand abating anytime soon. I actually see that continue to accelerate. And what is amazing to me is that in the areas where we place a particular focus, we see amazing growth. And what excites me is that I - knowing what I know about our new offerings and acceleration of innovation particularly in the first calendar quarter, we believe that's going to be a turbocharge. Now as you can imagine, I spend a lot of time with our global supply team - driving the day-to-day operations with Tarek here. And obviously, we have to move at the first two quarters of the year. But I feel pretty good about accelerating that in the back half, a combination of supply availability and customer acceptances. But again, when you normalize the growth for everything I said earlier to Wamsi, which is including the as-a-Service pivot, you should think about not three to four, but more like six to seven because that's the way we should think about it. And then in that, remember, the growth of the ARR is going to continue to accelerate 35% to 45%. And hopefully, in 2022, we're going to get the credit for the transformation we drive in this business.\nOperator: The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. \nAmit Daryanani: I guess, maybe I want to talk a little bit on the Intelligent Edge side. And Tarek, maybe you could just talk about what's driving out just the revenue deceleration, but also the margin declines over there. The margin drop seemed fairly material. So I would love to understand kind of what's happening there. How do you see that business ramp up through fiscal 2022? And then, Antonio, I want to touch this with you, which is you've talked a fair bit about the conviction in the orders that you have and how good they are and I think you've said about a lack of cancellation being a pretty big driver for it, therefore your confidence. I would imagine cancellations will only happen when supply chain issues alleviate versus right now. Is that fair? If so, are there other things you're looking at in your business that gives you confidence that these orders will convert?\nAntonio Neri: Tarek, you want to talk about the - the Aruba piece of it which obviously the Network-as-a-Service was a big component of that?\nTarek Robbiati: Yes, yes. So let me take that, Antonio. Thank you. So Amit, as we shared in our scripts, we signed a very substantial Network-as-a-Service contract for the first time with a large US retailer. And this had a headwind on revenue growth in Aruba of about 800 basis points and a headwind on operating margins of about 500 basis points. So if you were to normalize for it, you still realize - you would realize that the double-digit growth in Aruba and high-teens margins are still there. And we're very comfortable they're there for us. Aruba is at 40% business meaning we do see the top-line growth to be in the high-teens and the margins to be in the high-teens as well, approaching a sum of 40% overall. Nothing has changed. We feel very comfortable, particularly knowing that the order book remains very strong. If anything, there was one part of our company that suffered a little bit more of supply chain constraints in Q4, it is Aruba. But it's just simply deferring revenue that could have been realized in Q4 into Q1 and Q2 of fiscal year 2022. The order story remains incredibly strong, and the demand there is super solid. So we're very confident about the prospects of Aruba for fiscal year 2022.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. I mean, I think that we covered pretty much everything. Remember what the net $800 million at this time. So very pleased with that, which makes us a more lean and agile company. And part of that is also the ability to execute faster. One of the big changes we made also was the way we compensate our sales force on orders, and this is what you see. We are now confident based on our systems implementation. If you recall, we started three years ago. And we are also getting close to that completion, allowed us to make some changes here in the way we drive the business going forward. And I think this is all about operational excellence and execution. On the inventory side, I think the team has done a remarkable job driving working capital and - but also at the same time, making the right long-term bets on this inventory, which give us not just the ability to convert but pricing power. And as I said in the Security Analyst Meeting, we tend to be the market leader in changing prices. And we will continue to do so, because it's the right thing to do at the right time. And so we will continue to manage that inventory as needed for our customers and for delivering of numbers.\nOperator: And our final question will be from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess I wanted to get your thoughts on H3C. You had a strong year with plus growth in equity income. How should we think about kind of fiscal 2022 there? And what's your visibility into H3C navigating the supply chain constraints as well? And through the conference call today, you've mentioned multiple times about a back-end loaded year. So just wanted to see if that's consistent with how should we think about, H3C equity income as well? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Well, Tarek and I felt it was important to share with you how H3C contributes to our financial performance. You saw that slide that shows the equity interest of 49% and what value drives for our shareholders, which is pretty significant. And H3C is an independent entity, which operates in China, obviously. And they manage the business day-to-day. And they have done a remarkable job. I mean they continue to grow their business in China. They are positioned extremely well, in the, what they call the ICT business, the support telco, the support enterprise customers and SMB. They have a unique value proposition and set of products, which are very well received. And we expect that business to continue to grow double-digits. And the report is incredibly accretive to what we do. But also, at the same time, as Tarek said, is a unique setup, which no other multinational really has been able to achieve in a country, obviously, which is going to a lot of changes here. And it's the second largest market on the planet, okay? So if you believe that market will continue to grow, and they are very well positioned, this will continue to accrete to our shareholders. Now as we said in previous quarters, are put expire at the May timeframe.\nTarek Robbiati: That's right.\nAntonio Neri: And as always, we will do what is the right thing for our shareholders, what is the best return for our shareholders. And we will make that decision at the right time.\nTarek Robbiati: And Antonio said it very well. I would simply add that the interesting data point on the slide, and hopefully, you all take away is that, we're not in a rush. The value of our stake continues to accrete. And we feel very, very good about our position in H3C.\nAntonio Neri: Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you, Jeff. We appreciate you making the time to talk to us today. I hope you walk away with a clear view of how we are performing. I'm particularly pleased with the momentum we have as we enter 2022. Our strategy could not be more on point. I think the demand is strong, not only because of the market, but because of our solutions. And I'm very excited about the ability to create and accelerate our shareholder value in 2022. And then we have some amazing things coming down the pipeline in terms of innovation that's going to differentiate us even further. And so I'm looking forward to 2022, while we navigate this short-term challenge of supply, but we are very confident on the current guidance and the consensus out there. And we hope to exceed that as we execute in the next quarter. If I don't speak to you in the next month or so, thank you very much. Be well. Happy Holidays to everyone and to prosper 2022. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. And for those of you who attended our virtual Security Analyst Meeting last month, thank you. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss how our edge-to-cloud strategy position us to capture an expanded market opportunity and accelerate shareholder value creation. HPE ended fiscal year 2021 with strong momentum. Customers are responding to our edge-to-cloud value proposition as evidenced by the record demand for our solutions. Demand accelerated in the second half of the year, driving fiscal year 2021 orders growth of 16% year-over-year. Revenue of $27.8 billion in fiscal year 2021 grew in line with our long-term outlook, up 1% year-over-year. In fiscal year 2021, we executed very well, which enabled us to exceed our commitments across all financial metrics, even with a substantial order backlog. Our as-a-Service Annualized Revenue Run Rate or ARR of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. We significantly improved our gross and operating margins, which increased our fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP operating profit by 25% year-over-year. We delivered fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.96, up 27% year-over-year. And we generated the fiscal year 2021 free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up $1 billion year-over-year, which translates to growth of 177%. This was a very strong performance, and it was particularly impressive against the backdrop of industry-wide supply constraints, which continue to challenge our ability to convert orders to revenue as quickly as we would like. We have a world-class global operations team that continues to work closely with a long-standing diverse network of suppliers. We continue to take proactive inventory measures to better position us to deliver against this robust customer demand. Our results in Q4 strengthened the momentum we have as we enter fiscal year 2022. Increased demand in the quarter drove orders growth of 28% year-over-year, with particular strength in our as-a-Service orders, which grew an impressive 114% year-over-year, including a large network as-a-Service win. We also saw record levels of orders in key growth areas, including Intelligent Edge, High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence businesses. We delivered $7.4 billion in total Q4 revenue, which was up 7% sequentially and above normal sequential seasonality. We expanded our gross and operating margins, increasing our Q4 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share by 27% year-over-year. And we generated Q4 free cash flow of $94 million, in line with the outlook we provided at the end of Q3. Tarek will take you through our quarterly results in detail, but I would like to spend a little more time putting a full fiscal year in context for you. Our fiscal year 2021 results proved the relevance of our strategy to customers and the traction of our transformation to become the S2 cloud company. As we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, HPE is at the center of several compelling megatrends; the explosion of data at the edge, the mandate for a cloud experience everywhere, and the need to extract value from data to generate insights. HPE is differentiated edge-to-cloud strategy uniquely positions us to capitalize on these trends and capture growing profitable markets. Our solutions and services help customers overcome the challenges of multi-generation IT and enable them to access, control and maximize the value of all their workloads and data everywhere. We are executing with focus and speed to deliver against our vision and strategy. We are making strategic investments and taking deliberate steps to continue to shift our business. And as I have said previously, this transformation is my number one priority, and I'm proud of the progress we have made in fiscal year 2021. Our Intelligent Edge business grew fiscal year 2021 revenue 13% year-over-year, with orders exceeding for the first time $4 billion. Customer demand was up strong double digits year-over-year as more customers look for ways to create new digital experiences at the edge and capitalize on the data generated there. But the industry-wide component shortages kept us for converting our full order momentum to revenue in Q4, and we enter fiscal year 2022 with record levels of backlog. Our market leadership at the Edge remained very strong. HPE was positioned as the leader in - one of the leaders in the Magic Quadrant Gartner provides for wireless access network edge infrastructure, which is notable because HP is only one of the two companies to be positioned in the Leader Quadrant four years in a row. We continue to drive strong innovation in this business. In Q4, we introduced the industry-first distributed services switch, which brings software-defined services and security right to where the data is created in process. Developed in partnership with Pensando, this solution eliminates legacy appliances and whole software needed to build the hybrid cloud demand - demanded by modern applications and IT organizations. In Q4, we closed the largest network as-a-Service deal in HP history to help a large US retailer enhance its customer and employee experience throughout the stores. In addition, the Major League soccer franchise, FC Cincinnati, standardized on Aruba at the TQL Stadium to deliver next-generation digital cashless, counterless fund and event experiences. The franchise deployed an end-to-end Aruba Edge Services platform network at its new 26,000-seat stadium to power this game day and special event experiences. Orders of HPE's High Performance Compute and AI offerings were also up strong double digits year-over-year. This record level of demand has generated an order book of awarded contracts now at $2.7 billion, excluding the important $2 billion win with the U.S. National Security Agency. HPE expanded our number one market position in HPC with 37% market share as of calendar Q2 data, which is more than 14 points above the closest competitor. And according to the list of the top 500 supercomputers released just two weeks ago, 33 of the top 100 most powerful supercomputers in the world were built by HPE. This is more than any company. At the end of Q4, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, NERSC at Berkeley Lab accepted the first phase of the promoter supercomputer. Powered by the HPE Cray EX system, Bermuda introduced a new generation of supercomputing capabilities to more than 8,000 scientists performing research for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science. HPE is uniquely positioned to bring the AI, deep learning and data analytics capabilities of our most advanced supercomputers to mainstream enterprises through the HPE GreenLake platform. In Q4, we announced that Eni, a global energy company, selected HP GreenLake to upgrade its existing HPE supercomputer. Through HPE GreenLake, Eni can accelerate discover - discovery of new energy sources with more accurate modeling and simulations, as well as become more sustainable by monitor utilization and energy consumption within an - as-a-Service solution. We continue to strengthen our Compute and Storage businesses where we saw strong orders and profitability in fiscal year 2021. In Compute, orders increased more than 10% in fiscal year '21 and we delivered operating margins of 10.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. We are making bold moves to transform our Storage business into a cloud-native data services business, which resulted in a high single-digit order growth and gross margin expansion, up 130 basis points year-over-year. And we continue to see high services attach rate, helping enable HP Pointnext orders to increase mid-single digits in fiscal year '21. This contributed to the overall performance of HPE Pointnext, which ended fiscal year 2021 with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 of revenues, highlighting the potential for future revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. In fiscal year 2021, we generated a strong momentum in our transformation to an as-a-Service company. Our company as-a-Service orders increased 61% year-over-year, with HPE GreenLake orders increasing 46% year-over-year. Our as-a-Service annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. The growth of our ARR is particularly noteworthy because, this recurring revenue stream is high quality and high margin. During our Security Analyst Meeting last month, Tarek shared that more than 60% of our ARR mix is software and services. And we believe that portion will grow to more than three quarters in the next three years. Our ARR gross margins are well above our corporate average gross margins today. And the addition of high-value software content will drive margins even higher. Our pivot to an as-a-Service company is enabled by HPE Financial Services, which increased fiscal year 2021 financing volume 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth within HPE GreenLake. We continue to advance our leadership in our HP GreenLake offering. In September, we introduced HP GreenLake for data protection, which are cloud services designed to protect data across edge-to-cloud overcome brands of war attacks and deliver rapid data recovery. This new set of solutions marks our entry into the growing data protection as-a-Service market. Our acquisition of Zerto enabled us to add market-leading data protection to our cloud services portfolio to help enterprises take cyber threats and ransomware attacks head on. We also launched HP GreenLake for data analytics, which includes the industry-first, unified modern hybrid analytics and Data Lake platform. This strategically important solution positions HPE in the growing Unifi analytics market and helps customers accelerate modernization initiatives for all data across edge-to-cloud. We continue to see incredible response to our HP GreenLake offering. We added more than 300 new GreenLake customers during fiscal year 2021, bringing our customer count to more than 1,250. New GreenLake logos represent an increasing share of orders with approximately one quarter of Q4 GreenLake orders coming from new customers. Today, more than 900 partners sell HPE GreenLake, one of the largest, partner of ecosystems selling as-a-Service offerings in the industry. We added more than $1.5 billion of GreenLake total contract value over the last year, bringing the total to more than $5.7 billion. Examples of new GreenLake logos includes family estates, the second largest family-owned winery in the world which adopted HPE GreenLake through our channel partner PKA technologies to add flexibility and scale, its capacity to meet the increasing demand of Auto - N&F Automations. The HPE GreenLake solution powers the one in this automated warehouse, where approximately 60 different types of wines that produce mobile package and prepare for shipping while reducing overall IT costs. We also won a deal with ONGC, India's largest Oil and Natural Gas Company, which is used in the HP GreenLake platform to make one of the largest SAP implementations in the world more manageable and flexible. Our Q4 rounded out an impressive year for HPE. And I'm proud of all we've had accomplished. We have made incredible progress in transforming to become the edge-to-cloud leader, executing on our strategy to help customers in truly differentiated ways and position ourselves for sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. At the same time, we have advanced our ESG initiatives, which in Q4 earned us a position on a highly competitive Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, placing in the 98 percentile. We exceeded our commitments in fiscal year 2021, and our momentum is strong as we enter fiscal year 2022 with a strategy more relevant to customers than ever before and a sharp focus on execution. With that, I will turn it over to Tarek to share additional details about the quarter. Tarek, over to you. Well, thank you, Shannon. I will start, and obviously, I would like Tarek to comment on the model in itself. Listen, we are super proud of the momentum we have in the market with HPE GreenLake. We believe it's truly differentiated in the market. And as we show you some, two-thirds of that is already in the software and services, and we believe in three years, will be more than 75% of it, which obviously come with high margin and more durable revenue in many ways. What customers like about the model is the ability to procure everything from Edge to cloud from one integrated platform. And it's not just what I call Infrastructure as-a-Service or hardware as-a-Service on premises in a colo or at the Edge is the fact that they can consume anything from network as-a-Service, subscription to Aruba products to what I call private cloud to data services, which is part of the transformation we are driving in our storage portfolio. And as we said, $5.7 billion already in total contract value and in Q4, the growth was accelerated by a number of new logos, which again, we added 300 in fiscal year 2021, which drove the order growth to 114%, okay? So when you think about this, we have been delivering 40, 50, 60 and in Q4 it was 114%. And Aruba is one key component of that. But what we see now, Shannon, is also the Storage part of it is growing very rapidly. And that's why I'm excited about next year because we're also adding new capabilities to that platform, particularly in the early part of 2022. So overall, I will say this has been a home run. We believe we have years of advantage. We are disclosing all our numbers, as you see, versus some of our competitors are not sharing anything as far as I can see. And what I'm really pleased is that we have now 900 partners selling with us, co-selling, and you will see their offers in our platform here soon because that's the way we drive, fully push from both sides, direct and indirect. So Tarek, do you want to talk about the modeling? Sure. Well, I mean, if you look at our results, right, once - right, so we grew orders. Total company orders 16% year-over-year, but our revenue in actual dollars was up 3%. Obviously, there is a big divergence there between 16% and 3%, right? And that's driven by the supply availability. Despite the fact that we continue, I think, do a great job navigating through the challenge. And the one area I'm really particularly pleased, one say is the fact that linearity in the business in the way we approach customers that book orders is now more front end and back end in the quarter itself. I always talk about quarters having 13 weeks and what is amazing to me in the last couple of quarters, the bookings have been more on the front end than the back end, which allows us, actually. It's a little bit counterintuitive if you think about it. The more orders are - bring early on, the more I can convert despite the supply chain challenges because I have more time and more velocity, if you will. So listen, as Tarek said, and I said in my remarks, short-term, we're going continue to navigate. This is an industry-wide challenge. But we're very confident with the actions we are taking ourselves. And the fact of the matter is that that backlog is very durable. People asked me early on, have you seen cancellation? I can tell you right now, zero, no cancellations whatsoever. And the orders coming in every day, every week is incredibly strong. So, we have to navigate the next quarter or two. And then based on our understanding and the work we have done with our suppliers, the second half will be better. And then also remember, we have, I think, world-class capabilities, both on the supply chain operations and our engineering capabilities to be able to adjust components based on the bump. And then also, remember, a big chunk of the backlog is related to acceptances in the customer base with HPC, which is already built and shipped. But as you know, we cannot recognize revenue until fully accepted. This quarter, we recognized a customer, which had a large order in HPC. But remember, in 2022, we have the large exascale deals and one of them is going to be very important for us as we think about the back half of the year. So, that's why Tarek and I are very confident in that 3% to 4% guidance. And let's remind ourselves in the 3% to 4% guidance, we have 1 to 1.5 points of headwind because of the transition towards as a service, right, which is great, is durable is long-term growth. And so you normalize for that, it's more like 5% to 5.5%, if you will. And then on top of that, you have to add the currency, which obviously is a headwind in the sense that the 3% to 4% is constant currency. So, if you are all of that, we are more than like in the 7% to 8% growth. And remember that Q4 was a $7.4 billion, the largest quarter despite the supply chain going all the way back to 2019. Well, glad you call it massive because we agree with you. It's a strong momentum and clearly was stronger in Q3 and Q4 than the first half of the year. I think it's a combination, Simon. I think that obviously, there is a market demand out there driven by the recovery in the economy. I think customers also worry about the impact of the supply that we'll have in the short, mid-term. But on the same time, we should not underestimate the power of our portfolio because I got this question earlier on, you take this double-bookings? Perhaps in the commodity space, but not on the value space. We believe Aruba is unique and differentiated. This is not something you can swap by somebody else. And that business, it's a true mobile-first cloud-native approach, which drives a unique experience at the edge. And that's - the momentum has happened for a number of quarters now despite the short-term challenge of supply. HPC, we are the clear number one leader with 35% market share and 14 points advantage against the second competitor. And then the supercomputer, I don't think there's anybody that can match us. 35% of the top 100 supercomputers are all back and enterprise, and we're going to deliver the extra scale in 2022. And GreenLake, again, the question about GreenLake is a true hybrid differentiated offerings from edge to cloud. And I think that has been in the making now for a number of years, and the pipeline is just amazing to me. And now we are getting better and better in closing deals faster and deploying the solution, which, remember, it's not just deploying it, it's also driving usage. And so it's a combination of growth in the current installed base and new logos, which I commented 300 new logos. So we believe there may be some in the commodity space, but the rest is because of our edge-to-cloud offering, which is resonating in the market, and we believe that's going to accelerate in 2022. Go ahead, Tarek, and then I will comment on the end, on the back end. Yes. Just to add a few comments. In simple terms, this is the way to think about it. So first of all, our compute orders were up more than 10% in 2021. Our units normalized for - remember, the 2020 backlog, if you remember, when the COVID started, we had a $750 million backlog which we cleared $500 million in Q3 2020 and $250 million in Q4. When you normalize for that, units are up. Obviously, AUPs are up for two reasons; number one, cost; and number two, structural changes. As we introduce the next-generation of our Compute platform, call it, Gen 10.5 and 11 you're going to see more options and more density in those platform, which drives structural changes, which are - we believe those structural changes are sustainable, irrespective of the changes of the commodity cost. And then if you listen to what we said in 2020 and 2021 are pivot to different segments of the market, we said we want to focus on growing segments of the market, while enterprise is still super important. SaaS, Telco and Edge are three growing markets where we have been benefit from. Telco obviously with a 5G deployment our Intelligent Edge Solutions at the Edge, particularly in retail, manufacturing and hospitality, and then obviously, the focus on the SaaS, which is not the big cloud providers, but Software-as-a-Service companies, which are driving quite significant growth. And then we have our own value of built into the platform with silicon root of trust and manageability. And all of this, by the way, is all now being delivered to HPE GreenLake as well. So GreenLake is a force multiplier for the growth in Compute, because the more we sell as-a-Service, the more recurring revenue in Compute we're going to have over time. So I hope that answers the question. Yes, I'll let Tarek start, and then I will add a few comments. Yes. Katy, I think in addition to what Tarek, first of all, I don't see the demand abating anytime soon. I actually see that continue to accelerate. And what is amazing to me is that in the areas where we place a particular focus, we see amazing growth. And what excites me is that I - knowing what I know about our new offerings and acceleration of innovation particularly in the first calendar quarter, we believe that's going to be a turbocharge. Now as you can imagine, I spend a lot of time with our global supply team - driving the day-to-day operations with Tarek here. And obviously, we have to move at the first two quarters of the year. But I feel pretty good about accelerating that in the back half, a combination of supply availability and customer acceptances. But again, when you normalize the growth for everything I said earlier to Wamsi, which is including the as-a-Service pivot, you should think about not three to four, but more like six to seven because that's the way we should think about it. And then in that, remember, the growth of the ARR is going to continue to accelerate 35% to 45%. And hopefully, in 2022, we're going to get the credit for the transformation we drive in this business. Tarek, you want to talk about the - the Aruba piece of it which obviously the Network-as-a-Service was a big component of that? Yes. I mean, I think that we covered pretty much everything. Remember what the net $800 million at this time. So very pleased with that, which makes us a more lean and agile company. And part of that is also the ability to execute faster. One of the big changes we made also was the way we compensate our sales force on orders, and this is what you see. We are now confident based on our systems implementation. If you recall, we started three years ago. And we are also getting close to that completion, allowed us to make some changes here in the way we drive the business going forward. And I think this is all about operational excellence and execution. On the inventory side, I think the team has done a remarkable job driving working capital and - but also at the same time, making the right long-term bets on this inventory, which give us not just the ability to convert but pricing power. And as I said in the Security Analyst Meeting, we tend to be the market leader in changing prices. And we will continue to do so, because it's the right thing to do at the right time. And so we will continue to manage that inventory as needed for our customers and for delivering of numbers. Yes. Well, Tarek and I felt it was important to share with you how H3C contributes to our financial performance. You saw that slide that shows the equity interest of 49% and what value drives for our shareholders, which is pretty significant. And H3C is an independent entity, which operates in China, obviously. And they manage the business day-to-day. And they have done a remarkable job. I mean they continue to grow their business in China. They are positioned extremely well, in the, what they call the ICT business, the support telco, the support enterprise customers and SMB. They have a unique value proposition and set of products, which are very well received. And we expect that business to continue to grow double-digits. And the report is incredibly accretive to what we do. But also, at the same time, as Tarek said, is a unique setup, which no other multinational really has been able to achieve in a country, obviously, which is going to a lot of changes here. And it's the second largest market on the planet, okay? So if you believe that market will continue to grow, and they are very well positioned, this will continue to accrete to our shareholders. Now as we said in previous quarters, are put expire at the May timeframe. And as always, we will do what is the right thing for our shareholders, what is the best return for our shareholders. And we will make that decision at the right time. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you, Jeff. We appreciate you making the time to talk to us today. I hope you walk away with a clear view of how we are performing. I'm particularly pleased with the momentum we have as we enter 2022. Our strategy could not be more on point. I think the demand is strong, not only because of the market, but because of our solutions. And I'm very excited about the ability to create and accelerate our shareholder value in 2022. And then we have some amazing things coming down the pipeline in terms of innovation that's going to differentiate us even further. And so I'm looking forward to 2022, while we navigate this short-term challenge of supply, but we are very confident on the current guidance and the consensus out there. And we hope to exceed that as we execute in the next quarter. If I don't speak to you in the next month or so, thank you very much. Be well. Happy Holidays to everyone and to prosper 2022. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. And as usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key fiscal year 2021 highlights on Slides 1 and 2, so now let me discuss our Q4 performance, starting with Slide 3. I am very pleased to report that we continue to see unprecedented demand across all our businesses with robust order growth, up 28% year-over-year. Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q4 revenues of $7.4 billion, up 7% from the prior quarter above normal sequential seasonality and this despite increased supply chain challenges that we foreshadowed at SAM last month. It's also worth highlighting that $7.4 billion of revenue represents the highest level since Q1 of fiscal year 2019, well before the pandemic. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, which was up 230 basis points from the prior year. And this was driven by our deliberate actions to shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline and cost takeout. As previously indicated, gross margins were pressured from prior quarter levels due to an increasing industry-wide shortages of certain components that have resulted in extended lead times and higher commodity costs underpinning backlogged orders. We continue to take proactive inventory measures and display healthy price discipline to minimize the impact of recent disruptions. We expect this dynamic supply chain situation to last well into calendar year 2022. We also continue to invest in high gross margin-rich areas of our portfolio. We've made investments in our overall go-to-market to accelerate our growth and our shift to an as-a-Service model. Even with these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 16% year-over-year increase in operating profit. Within other income and expense, we benefited from further strong gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio, an outstanding operational performance in HPC that I will address in more detail later. With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, up 27% from the prior year and at the high end of our outlook range for Q4. Excluding $2.2 billion of after-tax proceeds received from Oracle satisfaction of the judgment in the Itanium litigation, Q4 cash flow from operations was $784 million, and free cash flow was $94 million. For fiscal year 2021, this brings our total cash flow from operations to $3.7 billion, up $1.5 billion from the prior year, and our free cash flow to $1.6 billion, up $1 billion from the prior year driven primarily by an increase in earnings. Our strong execution and cost optimization and resource allocation program has effectively put us one year ahead of schedule with respect to delivering our previous free cash flow targets.  Finally, the strength of our cash flow has positioned us to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $157 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q1 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in January. We also reinstated our share repurchase program in Q4 buying $213 million in shares, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation and our view that the stock is undervalued. Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our accelerating as-a-Service business. We have made significant progress over the last year by adding over 300 new enterprise GreenLake customers to over 1,250 today and increasing our TCV by over $1.5 billion to our current lifetime TCV of over $5.7 billion. For Q4 specifically, our ARR was $796 million, which was up 36% year-over-year as reported and total as-a-Service orders were up 114% year-over-year, which represents an acceleration from Q3, demonstrating the strong momentum we are experiencing in this business. It's also important to remember the incremental disclosure we provided at SAM 2021, highlighting the significant proportion of software and services in our offerings that together make up more than 60% of the ARR mix today. We expect this mix percentage to expand to more than 75% by fiscal year 2024 as we add more software capabilities driving further gross margin improvement. Overall, based on strong momentum this year, I'm very happy with how this business is progressing, which gives us confidence to increase our ARR growth targets by 5 points to a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 5. Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total company revenue, generated record levels of orders, up strong double-digits. In the Intelligent Edge, revenue grew 2% year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal year 2021 was up 13%. Demand continued unabated in Q4 with order growth up over 50% year-over-year, but the component shortages we foreshadowed at SAM were more pronounced in our Aruba business. Additionally, our Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up trip triple digits year-over-year, significantly contributing to our ARR. We delivered a multimillion-dollar NaaS, Network-as-a-Service deal in Q4 for a large US customer, which represented more than 800 basis points headwind in the short-term to Aruba revenue in Q4, but will help our long-term financial profile in the business. Aruba Services also continued to grow strongly, up high single digits. Looking forward, we expect it will take some time for supply chain challenges to ease, but we finished fiscal year 2021 with over $4 billion in orders which will give us strong momentum through fiscal year 2022. In HPC & AI, demand strengthened even further with another record level of orders. Revenue grew 35% sequentially and was flat year-over-year with a difficult compare. We did have customer acceptances of some large contracts get pushed out into fiscal year 2022. And we now have $2.7 billion of awarded contracts in addition to the $2 billion contract awarded by the NSA, giving us confidence for next year and beyond. We expect robust revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 to get us back within the range of our original long term 8% to 12% CAGR outlook. In Compute, order growth was up strong double digits. Revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting above normal sequential seasonality and was up double digits year-over-year when normalizing for the Q4 FY 2020 backlog. Operating margins of 9.4% were up 280 basis points from prior year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. Within Storage, order growth accelerated and was up double digits year-over-year. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter ahead of normal sequential seasonality, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. All-flash arrays grew 7% year-over-year, led by Primera, up strong double digits. Nimble grew 4% year-over-year, with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double digits year-over-year. Storage operating profit margin was 13.8%, reflecting OpEx investments to continue driving product mix shift towards more software-rich platforms, including our cloud data services. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, orders accelerated and were up high single digits in Q4 and up mid-single digits for fiscal year 2021. Most importantly, revenue also grew as reported overall for fiscal year 2021, the first time in several years. This is, again, very important, as we enter fiscal year 2022 with strong momentum in our most profitable business. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 18% year-over-year, driven by strong double-digit growth in GreenLake. Revenue was up 3% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Our profitability is also benefiting from higher residual values realization and lower borrowing costs, as we continue to securitize our U.S. portfolio via the ABS market. Our operating margin was 14.1%, up 630 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 23.8% is well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum throughout fiscal year 2021. As mentioned previously, Q4 revenue of $7.4 billion is the highest level we've delivered since Q1 2019. With a strong demand environment, our strategic business mix shift and execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we increased our Q4 non-GAAP EPS to $0.52, up 27% year-over-year. Turning to Slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q4 of 33%. While rates were impacted as expected sequentially from the supply chain challenges previously discussed, we expanded gross margins up 230 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses. In total, in fiscal year 2021, we delivered nearly $900 million of incremental gross profit. Moving forward, we will face lingering supply chain challenges in the near term, but longer term, structural gross margins will improve from continuous mix shift towards the intelligent edge or IP storage Green Lake and all of our as-a-Service offerings. Moving to Slide 8. You can see we have utilized some of the incremental gross profit to make targeted growth investments while simultaneously expanding non-GAAP operating profit margins. We have increased our investment levels in R&D to fuel our long-term innovation engine and still selling costs to accelerate our growth and higher shift to our as-a-Service pivot. Even with these investments to drive long-term growth, we delivered operating margins in Q4 of 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year. On Slide 9, we want to highlight our unique setup in China through our investment in HPC that has and continues to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. Our investment and commercial agreement gives us a route-to-market in the second largest, fastest-growing IT market in the world. As you know, we do not consolidate revenue and operating profit from HPC, but recognize our 49% share of HPC's earnings through the equity interest statement line on our P&L as part of other income and expense. HPC has delivered outstanding operational performance throughout the year and generated $257 million of equity interest in fiscal year '21, which was up 21% from the prior year. This makes our business in China a very large contributor to our P&L, one that no other multinational has been able to replicate. Turning to Slide 10. We finished fiscal year '21 generating $3.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.6 billion of free cash flow, and this excluding, obviously, the $2.2 billion of after-tax, cash received from Oracle satisfaction of the Itanium litigation. Free cash flow was up $1 billion year-over-year and is $600 million more than the midpoint of our outlook at the start of fiscal year '20, primarily driven by increased earnings. Our cash flow profile is becoming more predictable and aligned to profitability as our restructuring costs diminish, and we grow our as-a-Service business beginning to recognize more deferred revenues from software and services. Moving on to Slide 11. We have made further progress enhancing our balance sheet strength with a strong free cash flow and payment from Oracle. Following the receipt of the cash from the Itanium litigation, we redeemed early, our $1 billion 4.65% coupon outstanding 2024 notes and this in a positive NPV transaction that is net debt-neutral. The  premium paid was a GAAP-only expense in Q4, and we will realize meaningful interest expense savings over the next three years. We are now in an operating company net cash position of $1.8 billion. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity available to balance long-term growth investments with consistent return of capital to our shareholders. Now, turning to our outlook on Slide 12. At our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '22, and I would like to encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. Having said that, let me reiterate the drill down into a few key components. We expect fiscal year '22 revenue growth in constant currency of 3% to 4%. As discussed, the supply chain environment remains very dynamic, and we expect component shortages with increased commodity costs, expedite and shipping fees to last for the next few quarters impacting near-term revenue and gross margins. In a nutshell, we expect to have more of a back-end loaded year in fiscal year '22 with the supply chain risk that we discussed reflected in our fiscal year '22 guidance. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.96 to $2.10 and free cash flow to be $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We expect free cash flow to be more in line with historical seasonality where the second half is a stronger generator of cash than the first half. Now specific to Q1 revenue, given the very strong backlog balanced by supply chain constraints, we expect revenue to be in line with normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q4 of fiscal year 2021 and are comfortable with current consensus levels. We also expect gross margins to be pressured in the short-term given supply chain. As a result, for Q1 2022, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.19 to $0.27 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42 to $0.50. So overall, I'm very proud of our progress throughout our strong fiscal year 2021. As Antonio said, we exceeded all our key financial targets in fiscal year 2021, often by a significant margin. The demand environment has been incredibly strong across our business with acceleration in the second half of fiscal year 2021; demonstrating that our edge-to-cloud strategy is working well and that we are entering fiscal year 2022 with strong momentum. We are now well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us and deliver against our fiscal year 2022 outlook. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. So yes, Sharon, I mean, Antonio said already quite a few things. So first and foremost is one - the first - this first and largest network as-a-Service contract contributed to orders in Q4 substantially, but did not contribute to the ARR because the revenue will be recognized over time. But notwithstanding that, the ARR, if you really look at our ARR progression quarter-after-quarter in fiscal year 2021, it's outstanding. We did $649 million in Q1 of ARR, grew that to $678 million in Q2, $705 million in Q3 and now approaching $800 million, $796 million to be precise in Q4. So the momentum in this business is extremely strong, and there isn't a particular business unit that is contributing. We're executing an integrated strategy that is about edge, cloud and data. Right now, the main contributors are the various parts of the organization that fit these three pillars. Aruba is one of them. The Storage business unit is another one. We will also continue to expand our as-a-Service offerings in HPC and AI because we see a tremendous opportunity there. And the future will tell us how big that opportunity will be for us. But we firmly believe in it. Sure, Kyle. So in terms of customer segments, the demand remains very strong across the board and large enterprise customers, SaaS companies, telcos, and we see very robust demand from all these customers. With respect to unit growth, units have been roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, but the right comparison is a normalized year-over-year comparison. If you normalize for Q4 2020 units that were sold, but for orders that were generated in Q1 and Q2, you remember the dynamics of fiscal year 2020, units have grown 13% Q4 2021 over normalized Q4 2020. Which is an excellent result for us. We're very pleased with it. And this comes together with very strong disciplines from our management team there in the compute space. We've executed a number of price increases ahead of price hikes of commodities and logistics costs coming up by way of expedite fees and container costs that have been rising quite dramatically, as you know. The AUP have risen overall at about 3%. When you think about this on a normalized basis, and we feel pretty good about our performance in Compute, both on the P, the price and the quantity. We feel that there is still strong demand moving forward, particularly in fiscal year 2022 with the order book that we have been able to generate and the backlog that we have in that segment. But that comment that I just made is true and very true for Aruba where we feel a very strong order demand in Aruba and also in storage. So we feel pretty good about fiscal year 2022, as Antonio commented a moment ago. Yes. So Katy, the most important comment I would make to you with respect to orders is that the acceleration of orders manifested itself very strongly in the second half of fiscal year 2021. And it's continuing from here on, the demand remains very strong. We're getting orders every day, and the linearity is better even this quarter than it was in the prior quarter last year. The trough for our business was hit in the second quarter of 2020 ever since revenue has been edging up. And we're now at a point in Q4 2021, where we hit the revenue that is at the high watermark that is on the par with the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 roughly. We do see the acceleration of the revenue growth year-over-year manifesting itself on a full year basis. But timing-wise, we did say in my script and hopefully, it was understood that, the fiscal year 2022 is going to be back-end loaded. Why is that? It's because we still have to navigate supply chain constraints and those supply chain constraints are probably not going to abate before the end of fiscal year 2022 and most likely calendar year 2022. Specifically for Q1, we're comfortable with current consensus levels on revenue and which also imply, as I said in my script, a seasonal decline of mid-single digits. But when you really look at the overall trend, year-over-year from now on, we do expect an acceleration of revenue that will be dampened a little bit by supply chain constraint that we're navigating day-after-day, month-after-month and quarter-after-quarter. Yes, yes. So let me take that, Antonio. Thank you. So Amit, as we shared in our scripts, we signed a very substantial Network-as-a-Service contract for the first time with a large US retailer. And this had a headwind on revenue growth in Aruba of about 800 basis points and a headwind on operating margins of about 500 basis points. So if you were to normalize for it, you still realize - you would realize that the double-digit growth in Aruba and high-teens margins are still there. And we're very comfortable they're there for us. Aruba is at 40% business meaning we do see the top-line growth to be in the high-teens and the margins to be in the high-teens as well, approaching a sum of 40% overall. Nothing has changed. We feel very comfortable, particularly knowing that the order book remains very strong. If anything, there was one part of our company that suffered a little bit more of supply chain constraints in Q4, it is Aruba. But it's just simply deferring revenue that could have been realized in Q4 into Q1 and Q2 of fiscal year 2022. The order story remains incredibly strong, and the demand there is super solid. So we're very confident about the prospects of Aruba for fiscal year 2022. That's right. And Antonio said it very well. I would simply add that the interesting data point on the slide, and hopefully, you all take away is that, we're not in a rush. The value of our stake continues to accrete. And we feel very, very good about our position in H3C."

With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\nAntonio Neri: Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. I am amazed by the resilience of our customers, partners, and team members. And I'm incredibly proud of the way Hewlett Packard Enterprise continues to serve the needs of our global communities during such unusual and evolving circumstances. We delivered a very impressive third quarter at the HPE with strong orders growth, expanded margins, and record-free cash flows. Overall, I am pleased to see how our differentiated portfolio is resonating with the market. And our age to close strategy is driving improved momentum across our businesses. Based on the strength of our Q3 performance, and our confidence about our momentum in the market, we are again raising our fiscal year 2021 EPS and free cash flow outlook, and we are also resuming stock repurchases.  Revenue in Q3 was $6.9 billion, in line with our outlook and normal sequential seasonality. Our Q3 orders were up against strong double-digits year-over-year, and our year-to-date order volume has increased 11%, showing the strength of our age to cloud offerings. We significantly expanded our non-GAAP gross and operating margins, driving our year-to-date non-GAAP operating profit and earnings per share up 28% and 27% year-over-year, respectively. We generated a record year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up to $1.1 billion year-over-year, putting us well ahead of the original outlook we announced last October.  I am particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results while mitigating against industry-wide supply constraints by taking proactive inventory measures, working closely with our suppliers, and deployed our best-in-class engineering capabilities to establish specific response plans. The impact of the pandemic continued to accelerate the shift we predict two years ago, to an edgecentric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven world. Now, more than ever, there is a greater need for secure connectivity, faster insights from data, and a cloud experience everywhere. We expect these trends to continue.  Digital transformation is no longer a priority, but a strategic imperative. To help our customers transform their businesses and be future-ready today, we have been focused on doubling down in key areas that are resonating strongly in the market. We had a record number of orders in both our Intelligent Edge business and high-performance computed and mission-critical solutions business. Due to strong demand and execution, these growth businesses now make up nearly 25% of our total Company revenue. Our Intelligent Edge business accelerated its momentum again in Q3 with 23% year-over-year revenue growth driven by a record number of new orders.  From customer demands for secure connectivity have generated a backlog five times greater than at the close of Q3 last year. As customers increasingly look for solutions to collect, connect, analyze and act on data at the Edge. We are leaning into this demand and continue to invest in innovated the edge. In June, we announced new AI ops, IoT, and security features for our Aruba Edge Services Platform or ESP, designed to streamline network operations, maximize IP efficiency, and more easily extend the network from the Edge to the cloud. Our Aruba ESP continues to gain traction with customers in different verticals.  In the Third Quarter, customers including Save a Lot, Monument Health, and Circa Resorts and Casinos, all standardized their networks on Aruba ESP. In our High-Performance Computer & Mission, Critical solutions business revenue was up 9% year-over-year, driven by a record number of new orders. We also generate our record order book, which now exceeds $2.5 billion. The exponential growth in data, along with AI and big data analytics all driving an increased need for high-performance computing and mission-critical capabilities in enterprises of all sizes.  To meet this demand, we bolstered our artificial intelligence capabilities with the acquisition of determined AI, our stepped-up that delivers a powerful software stack that trains AI mobiles faster at any scale using its open-source machine learning platform. We also continue to see an increasing number of customers accessing our high-performance computer solutions as a service through HPE GreenLake. With our HPE GreenLake cloud services for HPC, customers gained powerful, specialized, computed, and AI capabilities with a sustainable cloud experience. For example, in Q3, HP was awarded a $2 billion contract to be realized over a 10-year period with the National Security Agency to deliver high-performance computing solutions through the HP Greenlake platform.  The service will help the National Security Agency efficiently process data and allot new insight in sustainable new ways. Our core businesses generator robust year-over-year orders growth, as well as strong profitability and free cash flow in the quarter. Year-to-date, computer storage orders are up mid-single-digits. With Q3 operating margins of 11.2% and 15.1% respectively. We continue to offer more of our core capabilities as-a-Service. In Q3, we introduced unified compute operations as-a-Service throughout HP Greenlake age-to-cloud platform. This new cloud-based management service simplifies provisioning and automates the management of computer infrastructure wherever it resides.  Our storage business is transforming into a cloud-native Software-Defined Data Services business through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions. In May, we introduced our new cloud data services available through HPE Greenlake, as well as our new HPE Letra cloud-native data infrastructure. And just this week, we closed the acquisition of Zerto, an industry leader in cloud data management and protection, and ran some way of data recovery services, which will be soon available as a service through HPE GreenLake.  With these acquisitions, immediate repositions, HPE GreenLake is a high-growth data protection market with a proven scaled solution. HPE was the first to market 4 years ago in delivering announcer Service, Cloud expedience on-premises in our co-location or at the Edge with HPE Greenlake. Today, our HPE GreenLake is to cloud platform, has more than 1,100 customers. Our annualized revenue run rate this quarter was $705 million, up 33% year-over-year. Driven by strong as-a-service orbits growth, up 46% year-over-year.  Organizations across sectors, including retail, healthcare, financial services, and the public sector, are turning to HP Greenlake. For instance, we helped Liberty Mutual shift from a traditional CAPEX IT spend to a new pay-as-you-go model, creating a cloud experience on-premises to provide transparency into consumption while improving their speed in adapting to capacity demands. They standardized critical workloads on HP Synergy, delivered through HP Greenlake, resulting in a reduced data center footprint and significant cost savings, including a monthly unit rate well below public cloud alternatives.  We also see in the power of the full HPE age-to-cloud portfolio as customers are turning to HPE for integrated solutions, a combined secure connectivity data insight capability, and cloud experiences. Woolworths Group, Australia and New Zealand's largest retailer selected HPE GreenLake to power its new Wpay payment platform. They needed a solution that combined a powerful mission-critical architecture, with the ability to scale and also provided better cost efficiency back to Wpay and its Merchants Partners. Delivered through HPE GreenLake, their solution leverages our full age-to-cloud portfolio, including HP Aruba, HPE NonStop, HPE Primera, and HPE Synergy.  HPE Pointnext services also provided expertise to us over the Company's digital transformation. I believe this is a great example of the power of our HPE supply portfolio. To extend our leadership position in cloud services and further accelerate our pivot to as-a-service, we are relentlessly . We made several compelling announcements at HPE Discover in June. I am particularly excited about our new HPE GreenLake lighthouse offering. A secure cloud-native stack built with HPE Ezmeral software to autonomously optimize different workloads across the hybrid state, reducing time to deployment, and operating costs. We also introduced Project Aurora, to secure the enterprise.  Embedded in our HPE GreenLake aids to cloud platform Project Aurora automatically, and continuously verifies an attack. The integrity of the hardware, freeware, operating systems, platforms, and workloads, while also detecting advanced trends. And finally, demonstrating our continued commitment to our  assets that complement our own capabilities, we acquired a data platform developer, Ampool. Ampool will accelerate the HP Ezmeral analytics run-time, to deliver high-performance analytics for engineers and business analysts. I am proud of HP's performance in Q3 and year-to-date. And the significant progress we have made in becoming the edge cloud Company.  The momentum we have in the market compels us to move even further and faster. And our ability to transform with increasing speed is imperative. Transformation is my number one priority. At this pivotal moment, our purpose to advance the way people live and work has never been more important. Our vision to become the edge to cloud Company is  its tremendous relevance. And our portfolio is winning in the marketplace. Fueled by our purpose, vision, and portfolio, we have the opportunity to build a more discipline-enabled inclusive work.  We have a mandate to imagine new digital transformation strategies that support our own ESG goals and those of our customers, leading to better business outcomes and societal impact. We will never waiver from our commitment to being a force for good, and a strategic partner for our customers. We will continue to bring both new innovations to our customers, and we will continue to create value for our shareholders, and I'm grateful for the incredible team and I'm confident in and excited about the future. I hope you will join us for our virtual security analyst meeting on October 28, to hear more about our position in the market, our priorities, and our outlook for the year ahead. I will now turn it over to Tarek.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2021. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slides 1 and 2. So now, let me discuss our Q3 performance starting with Slide 3. I'm pleased to report that we are experiencing very strong demand across all of our businesses. Q3 was marked by accelerating order growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion, and robust cash flow generation.  Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter. And in line with normal sequential seasonality. Also, in line with our outlook that factored in summer off of the expected supply chain constraints we flagged. We are working to ensure disruption is minimal by taking proactive measures and coordinating with our world-class suppliers to establish tailored recovery plans. I am particularly proud of our non-GAAP gross margin that hit another record level of 34.7%, up 40 basis points sequentially, and up 420 basis points from the prior-year period.  This is driven by our deliberate actions to shift towards the higher-margin, software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline, and cost takeout. As previously indicated, we continue to invest in high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio, both in R&D and go-to-market, particularly in Aruba software and as-a-Service, which increased our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter.  We also booked two one-time charges in total $28 million for a legal settlement and bad debt associated with likely fraud, involving a channel partner in APJ. Even with these investments and one-time charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 25% year-over-year increase in operating profit. We continue to be focused on driving further efficiencies in the business. Within other income and expenses, we benefited from stronger operational performance in HPC and strong gains related to increasing valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio.  As a result, we now expect other income and expenses for fiscal year '21 to be an income of approximately 50 million. With strong execution across the business and despite 2 unanticipated one-time charges, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, up 31% from the prior year and above the higher end of our outlook range for Q3. Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $526 million. This puts us at the record $1.5 billion of year-to-date free cash flow, up 1.1 billion from the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in operating profit.  Finally, the strength of our business has positioned us to contribute substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $157 million of dividends in the quarter, and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October. We are also announcing today the resumption of share buybacks as a result of greater free cash flow generation and visibility. I'll come back to capital allocation more broadly when we discuss the outlook. Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4. Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total Company revenue, are executing strongly and experiencing record order levels. In the Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our topline momentum with record levels of orders, and 23% year-over-year revenue growth. Switching was up over 20% year-over-year, whereas wireless LAN experienced more acute supply constraints and was up mid-single-digits.  Additionally, the Edge as a Service offering was up triple-digits year-over-year, which reflects enabling software platforms, as well as network-as-a-service. We also continue to see strong operating margins at 15.8% in Q3, up 540 basis points year-over-year, which included 17 million one-time legal settlements that impacted margins by 2 points.  continues to perform strongly and contributed 7 points to the Intelligent Edge growth. In addition, we started generating meaningful revenue synergies by cross-selling the Aruba portfolio, which reinforces the merits of the Silver Peak deal.  In HPC & MCS, demand strengthened even further with a record order level. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer accepting milestones and deliver on more than $2.5 billion of awarded contracts, including the contract that Antonio mentioned with the NSA worth $2 billion over 10 years. We remain on track to deliver on our full-year and three-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%. In Compute, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting normal sequential seasonality despite previously anticipated supply chain tightness. operating margins of 11.2% were up 190 basis points from the prior year, due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment.  Within storage, revenue grew 1% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter ahead of normal sequential seasonality, driven by strong growth and software-defined offerings. Nimble grew 10% year-over-year with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double-digits year-over-year. All-flash Arrays grew by over 30% year-over-year, led by Primera. The mix shift towards more software-rich platforms helped to drive storage operating margins to 15.1%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, offset by continued investments in our cloud data services. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter, year-over-year as reported with both order and revenue growth expected for fiscal year '21.  Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was flat year-over-year and sequentially, while our bad net loss ratio did increase slightly to 94 basis points this quarter, it was entirely due to a one-time 11 million reserve charge related to the already mentioned likely fraud in APJ by a channel partner. Optioned for this one-off event, our bad debt loss ratio would have improved to just 61 basis points, aligned to pre-pandemic levels. More importantly, we continue to see improved cash collections above pre-pandemic levels. Our operating margin was 11.1% up 300 basis points from the prior year, and our Return on Equity at 18.3%, is well above the 15% plus target set at SAM.  Slide 5 highlights the key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. We have made significant progress since our Analyst Day last October by adding over 200 new enterprises, Greenlake customers, to over 1,100 today. And increasing our TCV by over $1 billion to our current lifetime TCV of well over $5 billion. For Q3, specifically, our ARR was $705 million, which was up 33% year-over-year, as reported and total as-a-Service orders were up 46% year-over-year. It is also important to note that the mix of our ARR is becoming more and more software-rich, as we build out our Greenlake cloud platform, which is improving our margin profile.  We look forward to providing more disclosure around our software and services mix at our Analyst Day later this fall, which I believe reinforces a significant value-add of Greenlake. Overall, based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth target of 30% to 40% CAGR from FY20 to FY23. Slide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year, and sustained momentum for the last 3 quarters. The demand environment continues to strengthen, and with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q3 by 31% year-over-year.  Turning to Slide 7, we delivered another record, non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q3 of 34.7% of revenues, which was up 40 basis points sequentially, and up 420 basis points on the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation storage offerings. We have also benefited from the new segmentation we implemented beginning of the fiscal year 2020. That gives us much better visibility into each business unit and enables a better resource allocation and discipline to drive operating leverage.  Moving to Slide 8, you can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margins substantially from pandemic lows to 9.8%, which is up 190 basis points from the prior-year period. We are driving further productivity benefits, and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan, while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fueling our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. As mentioned previously, Q3 operating expenses also included one-time charges not included in our guidance, totaling $28 million for a legal settlement, and the likely fraud scheme involving a partner.  Excluding these one-off charges, our operating margin would have been 10.2%. Turning to slide 9, we generated record year-to-date levels of cash flow with $2.9 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.5 billion of free cash flow, which is up to $1.1 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by increased operating profit. I would like also to underscore that this year, our free cash flow seasonality will be different than in prior years. We expect increased financial services volume that includes more than $150 million in Q4 financing for a very large deal that is predominantly Greenlake and will benefit our ARR and margins for years to come.  We also have further restructured payments, and growing working capital needs as we continue to buffer our inventory levels in the light of the disruption in the global IT supply chain. Now moving on to Slide 10, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified Balance Sheet. As of July 31st, the Operating Company's net cash balance turned positive due to our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we made additional progress during the quarter securitizing over $750 million of financial services-related debt through the ABS market.  The refinancing of higher costs unsecured debt with ABS financing, allows us to boost access to the financing market at a cheaper cost of debt capital, as well as diversify and segregate our Balance Sheet between our operating Company and our financial services business. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity to our operations, continuing to invest in our business to drive growth and return capital to shareholders.  Now, turning to our outlook on Slide 11, I'm very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full-year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in a demanding environment and our strong execution. This will be the fourth guidance increase since SAM in October 2020, we now expect to deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.88 and $1.96. With respect to supply chain, as indicated last quarter, industry-wide tightening somewhat constrained our supply as expected. We continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible.  And you can see our efforts in inventory balances that increased $1.3 billion year-to-date, which also reflects the strengthening demand environment and a substantial order book we have across the business. We expect the challenge supply chain conditions to persist until at least the middle of the calendar year 2022, and have factored these into our revenues, costs, and cash flow outlook. From a top-line perspective, although we remain prudent, given the chance supply chain environment, we are very pleased with the accelerating Q3 order momentum across all segments of the business.  More specifically, for Q4 '21, we expect revenue to be above our normal sequential seasonality from Q3 and are comfortable with current consensus levels. For Q4 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.14 to $0.22 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.52. Additionally, given our record levels, our free cash flow year-to-date, and confidence in our raised outlook, I'm very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year '21 free cash flow guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. That is a $600 million increase at the midpoint from our original sand guidance with the top end of this free cash flow guidance range at the peak levels attained in fiscal year '19.  As you recall, at the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2020, we suspended our share buybacks to preserve liquidity in the context of the global pandemic disruption. Although we continue to operate in a challenging supply environment, our order momentum and improved cash flow generation visibility give us the confidence to reinstate our share repurchase program. We are targeting up to $250 million of share repurchases in Q4 of fiscal year '21 and will update investors on our capital management policy for fiscal year '22 at SAM in October. As a reminder, we always follow a disciplined return-based capital allocation framework to maximize long-term shareholder value.  Our number one priority remains to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, through both organic and inorganic M&A investments while remaining committed to paying dividends to our shareholders. In addition, we will consider opportunistic share buybacks when we see a favorable return for doing so. So overall, and to conclude, I am very proud of the progress we have made year-to-date in fiscal year 21. It's clear that our Edge-to-Cloud strategy is resonating with customers, and driving improved momentum across all of our businesses.  Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC MCS have accelerated top-line performance with record levels of orders. Our core business of Compute and storage is demonstrating momentum with robust orders and improved margins, and our as-a-Service ARR is accelerating. All of this translates to improving revenue momentum, strong profitability growth, and record levels of free cash flow. We look forward to closing out our fiscal year much leaner, better resourced, and positioned to capitalize on the strong demand environment.  Lastly, as Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us for our virtual Securities Analyst Meeting in late October, where we will provide an update on our strategy, business insights, and financial outlook. Now with that, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. . We also request that you only ask one question. The first question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please, go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I guess the questions really around the free cash flow generation. I think you're implying based on the rates free cash flow guide, that we'll do around a 100 million or so free cash flow in Q4, which I think will be one of the softest .  Maybe just quantify some of the dynamics that are at play that's driving that power, have you talked about a few of them, but just quantify the headwind there. And secondly, the focus  to this $2 billion in cash number longer-term. Maybe touches on what are the key levers to get to the $2 billion number, and how much of that is self-help versus revenue-driven? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Sure. Thank you, Amit for the question. Yes, our free cash flow for Q4 is north of 100 million, it's actually implied in our guidance about 150 million in Q4. And this figure reflects a different seasonal profile that we have had this year in terms of our revenue and expense profile, but also a couple of very important dynamics that I would like to underscore.  First of all, we have to continue to make investments in our inventory level to withstand the supply chain constraints that we flagged for several quarters now. Second, in Q4 of fiscal year '21, in my script, I described a very, very large Greenlake deal that will impact free cash flow in Q4, but that will generate substantial ARR revenue in subsequent quarters.  This is a deal in several $100 million that we have not announced yet, but it is already something that we're financing. And this is affecting therefore free cash flow already as of Q4 of fiscal year '21. Thirdly, we are still peaking on restructuring costs in fiscal year '21 and we feel very positive about our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which will wind down at the end of fiscal year '22.  And so this is a nice segue to tell you about our guidance towards fiscal year '22 and the 2 billion targets that we have. We continue to expect revenue growth in fiscal year '22 with the momentum that carries out of fiscal year '21, and also the restructuring cost program winding down will be a key determinant of our generation of free cash flow in fiscal year '22. So hopefully I gave you color there. Does Antonio want to add something?\nAntonio Neri: No, the only thing I will say maybe is that listen, Tarek made this comment in his remarks, is the fact of the matter on the high-end -- on the top end of that balance we give you 1.7 billion, is almost the same number we achieved in 2020 -- 2019.  And therefore, in many ways, we are almost a year ahead of our commitment because if you'll recall, we said we're going to return to normalized free cash flow in 2022. In the reality, even when you finance these large deals that eventually we're going to communicate has nothing to do with the NSA deal.  We are already almost at the same number, so that's why we are so pleased with the momentum that we have. But it's a momentum based on the order growth, and all the actions we have taken, and the deliberate shift in our portfolio to higher margins. And that's what you see in our numbers in Q3, right? It's a record-breaking gross margin of 34.7%.\nAndrew Simanek: Perfect, thanks Amit for the question. Operator, can we go to the next one?\nOperator: The next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James, please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could discuss what you've done and what you plan to do in regards to price increases, and help us understand how this affects your sales growth and margins? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah, thanks, Simon, for the question. I will start, and then I will let Tarek comment. Listen, we take pricing actions all the time. In fact, we probably have the first to take pricing action in our industry, I will say. We continue to assess what is the right strategy by segment and making sure that we take those actions where appropriate.  The fact of the matter is that we have increased pricing even concrete. That's a fact. And we do that in a context of, obviously, supply availability, steep in demand in the right portfolio, and obviously, inflationary costs associated with some of the commodities.  At the same time, remember there is also new innovation against building our products, which has a structural impact in the sense that when you look at our infrastructure, new technologies drive two-thirds of the pricing in many ways in AOPs, but we could take close the actions all the time, Simon, and we will continue to do so.  And that's part of the reason also while we see record-breaking margins but in addition to the fact that we're still in the demand in the right place and driving that mix shift that we talked about before. So Tarek, I know you want to get more specific, probably.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you, Antonio, and thank you, Simon, for the question. We have in this context where you have a constrained supply environment to be very careful around managing to price, right? And we have taken action that is translating in this record level of gross margin of 34.7%.  Some of our competitors didn't take that action, and it's down to them and up to them. But we feel that the current environment is calling for additions that approach to pricing. And we see an encouraged, balanced pricing behavior across the market. So more specifically, with respect to our units in AUP and Compute. I'm sure someone will ask the question.\nTarek Robbiati: AUP was up to mid to high single-digits quarter-on-quarter reflecting pass-through of commodity costs and richer configurations. As always, configurations that are richer play a big rolling in the AUP, but also, pricing in this case. And units were flat quarter-over-quarter, given some expected supply chain constraints. So we feel pretty good about performance in computing.  In that regard, it's still a business that we have to manage very, very carefully on a day-to-day basis because the supply environment being volatile forces us to do so. But we still see scope for continuous gross margin improvement across the board and in Compute as well.\nAndrew Simanek: Perfect, thanks for the question, Simon. Operator, can we go to the next one?\nOperator: The next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to ask for one clarification real quick. How would you define normal seasonality in fiscal 4Q? And then the longer-term question would be, Tarek you've done a phenomenal job of driving gross margin leverage in the Company.  I'd just love to hear your thoughts on, as you think about the mix of visitors going forward, where do you think ultimately gross margin can actually go. What's the normalized gross margin in your mind, given the mix that HP's driving?\nTarek Robbiati: So, let me pick up the first question on the normalized seasonality. Typically, what you observe in terms of sequential quarter-over-quarter growth, I would say it's somewhere in the low single-digits around the 1% to 2% range between Q3 and Q4.  So Q4 and Q3 growth are about that level. Like I said in my script, I'm comfortable with the current consensus on revenue for Q4, and we feel pretty good about this. The order book is very, very solid. Antonio underscored this. Across the board, our order book is super solid. Now the question is, how much of that can be really accelerated in terms of conversion in Q4?  And it's, every day is another day, so we're working through that. And this obviously has an impact on gross margins, right? Because the more you wait for fulfilling an order, the more you can have an adverse impact on gross margins. But we feel fairly comfortable with us managing this dynamic and particularly leveraging or pulling the levers across the board that we have such as our revenue mix.  I want to highlight to you the continuous growth in Aruba. This level of growth in Aruba on our Intelligent Edge business of 23% comes with very high-calorie revenue, and we feel very, very comfortable and pleased with that trend.  Also, our growth in storage, which comes with very high-calorie gross margin revenue, is pleasing at 3%. We took share from some of our main competitors, and this gives you an idea that we have a few strings in our bow, so to speak, to actually continue to drive gross margins to better levels.\nAndrew Simanek: Perfect. Thanks, Aaron (ph). Can we go to the next question, please, Operator?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. You sound very bullish on order momentum and it seems like you can't capitalize on the full strong demand given some of the supply chain impacts. Is there any way to quantify the magnitude of sort of what is this revenue impact perhaps in the quarter and what you're expecting for maybe the next few quarters, and how confident are you that these orders won't be canceled or lost to other vendors? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Well, we are very confident in the sense that we have taken proactive actions. We continue to take proactive actions that can imagine a person evolve with some of this conversation with suppliers. But if you look at our order buffering -- sorry, inventory buffering we talked about, right? Our inventory is up 1.3 billion.  And at the same time, we have, I think, one of the best-in-class engineering teams that they can swap things as we go along the way. That said, as a look at this order book, there is so much potential upside here. Is all about that daily conversion.  And so far, once we -- we have not seen any cancellations. Just to be clear, when people ask me, hey, this is perishable? No, I can tell you, the answer is definitely, no. I think it's because also customers realize it's not just a supply constraint, but a need to provision more Compute and data insight capabilities.  And then, as I said earlier, even despite the fact that our Intelligent Edge business exited with a 5 times backlog on that unique segment of the market, we still delivered 23% in constant currency, 27% growth.  And that's why what Tarek said, we expect revenue to continue to grow, and in particular '22. And then to the question that was asked earlier about margin, the margin should strengthen over time because of the mix shift, and that Aruba is very important to us.  But fundamentally, I think our edge-to-cloud vision and strategy is absolutely resonating in the market because customers need three things. They need secured connectivity in this hybrid world. They need a cloud experience everywhere.  And then, they need data insights yesterday, in my view. And then, we need to be able to consume it as-a-service in an elastic way. We have all the forward ingredients, and that's why we're going to accelerate further and faster with this strategy because it's working.\nTarek Robbiati: And on the -- if I can add to Antonio's comments. In my mind, there is no point crying over spilled milk. If we could have converted more, we would have converted more, but it doesn't really matter.  The order momentum and the order book remained strong. And what we didn't convert in Q3 will convert in Q4 and subsequent quarters. To specifically give you an idea of where we would have ended in Q3. We probably would have ended above seasonal trends that we see between Q2 and Q3 by a low-single-digit percentage number. But the momentum is very strong in Q4 and also for '22, that's the interesting bit.  In the environment that we're operating in, the demand is very solid and with the supply constraints, we don't see them ending before the first half of calendar year '22. So we just have to navigate this as the capacity of all our manufacturing partners is not back to pre-pandemic levels, and that will still take a good 2 to 3 quarters.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thank you Wamsi for the question. Operator, can we go to the next one, please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Great, and congrats on solid progress on the ARR side and in the cash flow. My question is on the HPC segment. You suggested the full-year HPC revenue will grow within your target range of 8% to 12%. Is that on a revenue basis or order basis? And in this revenue, it would imply fiscal Q2 will see at least 50% growth. Am I doing the math correctly? If so, what's driving such growth? I understand revenue could be quite lumpy in this business. Thanks.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah, let me start, and Tarek is welcome to -- Listen, as you said, right? This business is lumpy because it kind of takes to book the order to build the ship and install it. And then most importantly, the customer accepts the order, meaning the workload that was intended to run on is active -- is in production.  And we normally see this trend accelerate in the back half of the year because of the way the acceptances work. So we absolutely expect a significant uptick here. And that's why we are very confident in our ability to deliver for the year 2021 the 8 to 12% growth that we committed.  Since the beginning actually of 2021. And we have a number of deals that are all now running the -- what we call the testing cycles. And fairly confident about the customer acceptances, which would allow us to recognize revenue.  This has nothing to do with supply availability in many ways because, obviously, those assistants, in many ways, have already shipped and they're already deployed. It just getting through the cycle for the customer to get the performance that they need.  And there is quite a bit of tuning that does get done when the systems are deployed. But to Tarek's point, the demand is unbelievably strong. Put aside the $2 billion award that we got yesterday, we announced yesterday, we continue to win multiple multi-million-dollar deals in many aspects. And you can see some of those as we announced throughout the quarter.  And that's the power of the portfolio we have in high-performance computing, and specifically, two  are in people earning capabilities. And by the way, we have $2.5 billion of award the business, which I don't consider backlog, is business that will be delivered over the next 12-18 months. In particular, the large Exascale systems, which are an amazing feat of technology, I will say.\nAndrew Simanek: Great, thanks Sidney for the question. Can we go to the next one, please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research, please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I was wondering if you can quantify how the shift to Greenlake and recurring revenue in as-a-Service is impacting revenue. If there's any way to sort of quantifying where you would have been if you hadn't sort of made the shift at this point.  And I'm also curious with regard to Greenlake, how are your customer conversations going? Not sure how many quarters ago you said we're shifting everything to at least have an option from a subscription standpoint. So I'm just wondering if it's still kind of a push to customers or is there more of a pull from them as they look at alternatives to the cloud? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thank you, Shannon. I mean, we are incredibly bullish about this business. I think we have a competitive advantage. And the competitive advantage comes from many aspects. One is the software.  Software that makes this consumption model a true consumption model, unlike some of the other ones were trying to catch up, which is more financial engineering in many ways. Understand everybody's getting into the space, but we have years of leadership here.  And the conversation goes as simple as this. I want the cloud experience on Prime and at the Edge. And we can bring that through Greenlake because it's a true cloud experience that you can consume elastically on a per-unit measure that we can measure all the way to core levels.  And be able to automate the whole experience through our software stack, which obviously HBS model now, it's becoming a very important component of that. And that's why Tarek made the comment earlier as we go through the end of October, we are going to give a little better disclosure of that because the software content with ARR continues to increase.  Aruba by definition Shannon, is really old software, right? And he said that the triple-digit growth is happening in our business because you are subscribing to get connectivity. And our platform is a cloud platform that scales because we manage now more than 1.5 million devices.  But it's more than a pool, I would say. When customers are becoming way more sophisticated about the hybrid state, whether show hosted data, and whether show . They realize that the vast majority is still on-premise.  And many of them will stay on-premise. It's just economics and physics. And we can deliver some experience on-prem and still give them a hybrid experience by managing the workloads and  outside the four walls.  And Greenlake is absolute to resonate and that's why you see us catering everything to Greenlake, whether it's connectivity, whether its data services, whether it is elastically computed. And more world-optimized services as we go along.  And that's why I said earlier, this is all about acceleration on that. And between now and March, you're going to see a massive acceleration. And that's why it's my number one priority. And by the way, as revenue is accretive from a gross margin perspective, so, Tarek, you want to talk about that.\nTarek Robbiati: Yeah, absolutely. So, Shannon, what I would say is, if you refer back to Slide 5 of our investor presentation, we showed the stack of revenue that composes our AUR, right? So our Greenlake revenue is across all segments, our Compute HPC MCS, storage, Aruba, and also HPFS as you can infer from that slide.  And the more we drive Greenlake by way of software, the more accretive it is to the overall gross margin of the Company. That's a key lever to drive gross margin moving forward. We're driving gross margin across every single stream lane through the revenue mix, and across also that revenue mix horizontally by way of pivoting the Company to become an as-a-Service Company.  So far, what I can tell you is that the Greenlake gross margin is substantially higher than the average gross margin of the Company that we posted today. And we look forward, Antonio and I to update you and every other member of the analyst's community at our virtual SAM event in October highlighting to you where we see the ARR growing.  And it's mixed by segment moving forward. And in composition, how much of it is software and how much of it comes from other types of revenue streams such as point NExOS, which are very important to the profitability of the Company.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks, Shannon. Next question, please, Operator.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: Yes. Thank you. Speaking of Greenlake, the 2 billion NSA contract is a great success story for that business. Should we assume that the 2 billion of revenue is recognized ratably over the 10-year contracts? Or will there still be lumpiness like you've seen in HPC historically and then also, when does that start to impact the financial model? Then I have a follow-up.\nAntonio Neri: I think it will be definitely recognized over time. There will be periods that will be a little bit lumpier because of the infrastructure, but start recognizing here in 2022 immediately. In fact, we're expecting here the first order to happen now and start shipping soon.  But obviously, the one thing you need to understand about this deal, it's not just about selling infrastructure and consumer-as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake is the true as-a-Service model and management at the same time. We are operating the whole environment, which is very different from then used to be in the past.\nAndrew Simanek: Thanks, Katy, I know you had a follow-up, but we'll catch you after the call. Operator, can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Pardon me, Mr. Sheerin, your line might be muted.\nAndrew Simanek: No problem. Operator, can we just go ahead to the next one?\nOperator: Yes. Our next question will come from Kyle Mcnealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKyle Mcnealy: Hi, thanks a lot for the question. Congrats on the strong results in Intelligent Edge. But I'm curious about where you think we can go from here. It's been growing at -- faster than what the market's typically grown at in the past.  We realize that Wi-Fi 6 adoption curve is helping that, but how sustainable do you think this 20% plus growth rate is that we're seeing now, and should we expect some deceleration in there, or are there potential for continuing momentum or acceleration with the Wi-Fi 6 upgrade?\nAntonio Neri: Listen, I expect this business to continue to grow double-digits, right? We're very confident with that forecast. And honestly, maintaining or improve it even, the level of profitability because as Tarek made the comment earlier, right?  This quarter was impacted by a settlement on a legal matter that has been going on for a decade. And so, I'm pleased that that finally has completed, which was $17 million that we booked for this and has nothing to do with Aruba. It just happened way before Aruba for that matter. And so, the reason why I'm confident is that we have a unique value proposition. The value proposition of Aruba is mobile-first cloud-first, which is based on three layers.  One is the unification of the network for whatever type of connectivity you need, which is Wi-Fi and to the point, Wi-Fi 6 is now been adopted, and we are, I think, the largest vendor shipping Wi-Fi access points, second is obviously LAN, third is WAN, and that's why this acquisition has been incredibly well-received by our customers.  And very timely because it's integrated now in the same control plane. And going forward, we're going to integrate more solutions like 5G and Edge computing, and that's why this Edge-to-Cloud platform is essential.  But the Aruba Edge platform is what allows us to deliver the entire Edge-to-Cloud platform because now that platform also serves as the backend to deliver iAS for customer\u2019s on-prem and at the Edge for computer installers too, including data services or workload-optimized solutions.  So super pleased. And remember what I said, we exit Q3 2021 with a five times backlog on a normal run rate in that Aruba, and the bookings were very, very strong, super strong.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks, Kyle, for the question. And I think that takes us about time. So that'll be our final question. Antonio, why don't I turn it over to you for any final remarks if you have?\nAntonio Neri: Yes. So again, thank you for taking the time today. Again, we are very pleased with our Q3 result, which again was marked by the older strong momentum in line with revenue expectations, but most importantly, strong improvement in gross and operating margin, and record year-to-date orders and free cash flow.  And that gives us the confidence to, once again, for the fourth time in the year, raise EPS and free cash flow and enter 2022 with good visibility about what we think is going to happen. I'm particularly bullish about the IT spends cycle.  People ask me, what do you think the Delta virus is going to do? It is going to do nothing on demand. I can tell you that now. It may have some impact on supply availability, but nothing on-demand, let me be clear about that.  And the reason why is because customers need to digitize their business, they need to create a more IT environment, and honestly, they need to extract insight from the data at a pace we've never seen before, and our Edge-to-Cloud platform strategy is resonating. So thank you for taking the time to be with us today, and hope to catch up at the end of October at the Securities Analyst Meeting.\nAndrew Simanek: Perfect. Thank you. Operator, I think we can go ahead and close out the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. I am amazed by the resilience of our customers, partners, and team members. And I'm incredibly proud of the way Hewlett Packard Enterprise continues to serve the needs of our global communities during such unusual and evolving circumstances. We delivered a very impressive third quarter at the HPE with strong orders growth, expanded margins, and record-free cash flows. Overall, I am pleased to see how our differentiated portfolio is resonating with the market. And our age to close strategy is driving improved momentum across our businesses. Based on the strength of our Q3 performance, and our confidence about our momentum in the market, we are again raising our fiscal year 2021 EPS and free cash flow outlook, and we are also resuming stock repurchases.  Revenue in Q3 was $6.9 billion, in line with our outlook and normal sequential seasonality. Our Q3 orders were up against strong double-digits year-over-year, and our year-to-date order volume has increased 11%, showing the strength of our age to cloud offerings. We significantly expanded our non-GAAP gross and operating margins, driving our year-to-date non-GAAP operating profit and earnings per share up 28% and 27% year-over-year, respectively. We generated a record year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up to $1.1 billion year-over-year, putting us well ahead of the original outlook we announced last October.  I am particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results while mitigating against industry-wide supply constraints by taking proactive inventory measures, working closely with our suppliers, and deployed our best-in-class engineering capabilities to establish specific response plans. The impact of the pandemic continued to accelerate the shift we predict two years ago, to an edgecentric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven world. Now, more than ever, there is a greater need for secure connectivity, faster insights from data, and a cloud experience everywhere. We expect these trends to continue.  Digital transformation is no longer a priority, but a strategic imperative. To help our customers transform their businesses and be future-ready today, we have been focused on doubling down in key areas that are resonating strongly in the market. We had a record number of orders in both our Intelligent Edge business and high-performance computed and mission-critical solutions business. Due to strong demand and execution, these growth businesses now make up nearly 25% of our total Company revenue. Our Intelligent Edge business accelerated its momentum again in Q3 with 23% year-over-year revenue growth driven by a record number of new orders.  From customer demands for secure connectivity have generated a backlog five times greater than at the close of Q3 last year. As customers increasingly look for solutions to collect, connect, analyze and act on data at the Edge. We are leaning into this demand and continue to invest in innovated the edge. In June, we announced new AI ops, IoT, and security features for our Aruba Edge Services Platform or ESP, designed to streamline network operations, maximize IP efficiency, and more easily extend the network from the Edge to the cloud. Our Aruba ESP continues to gain traction with customers in different verticals.  In the Third Quarter, customers including Save a Lot, Monument Health, and Circa Resorts and Casinos, all standardized their networks on Aruba ESP. In our High-Performance Computer & Mission, Critical solutions business revenue was up 9% year-over-year, driven by a record number of new orders. We also generate our record order book, which now exceeds $2.5 billion. The exponential growth in data, along with AI and big data analytics all driving an increased need for high-performance computing and mission-critical capabilities in enterprises of all sizes.  To meet this demand, we bolstered our artificial intelligence capabilities with the acquisition of determined AI, our stepped-up that delivers a powerful software stack that trains AI mobiles faster at any scale using its open-source machine learning platform. We also continue to see an increasing number of customers accessing our high-performance computer solutions as a service through HPE GreenLake. With our HPE GreenLake cloud services for HPC, customers gained powerful, specialized, computed, and AI capabilities with a sustainable cloud experience. For example, in Q3, HP was awarded a $2 billion contract to be realized over a 10-year period with the National Security Agency to deliver high-performance computing solutions through the HP Greenlake platform.  The service will help the National Security Agency efficiently process data and allot new insight in sustainable new ways. Our core businesses generator robust year-over-year orders growth, as well as strong profitability and free cash flow in the quarter. Year-to-date, computer storage orders are up mid-single-digits. With Q3 operating margins of 11.2% and 15.1% respectively. We continue to offer more of our core capabilities as-a-Service. In Q3, we introduced unified compute operations as-a-Service throughout HP Greenlake age-to-cloud platform. This new cloud-based management service simplifies provisioning and automates the management of computer infrastructure wherever it resides.  Our storage business is transforming into a cloud-native Software-Defined Data Services business through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions. In May, we introduced our new cloud data services available through HPE Greenlake, as well as our new HPE Letra cloud-native data infrastructure. And just this week, we closed the acquisition of Zerto, an industry leader in cloud data management and protection, and ran some way of data recovery services, which will be soon available as a service through HPE GreenLake.  With these acquisitions, immediate repositions, HPE GreenLake is a high-growth data protection market with a proven scaled solution. HPE was the first to market 4 years ago in delivering announcer Service, Cloud expedience on-premises in our co-location or at the Edge with HPE Greenlake. Today, our HPE GreenLake is to cloud platform, has more than 1,100 customers. Our annualized revenue run rate this quarter was $705 million, up 33% year-over-year. Driven by strong as-a-service orbits growth, up 46% year-over-year.  Organizations across sectors, including retail, healthcare, financial services, and the public sector, are turning to HP Greenlake. For instance, we helped Liberty Mutual shift from a traditional CAPEX IT spend to a new pay-as-you-go model, creating a cloud experience on-premises to provide transparency into consumption while improving their speed in adapting to capacity demands. They standardized critical workloads on HP Synergy, delivered through HP Greenlake, resulting in a reduced data center footprint and significant cost savings, including a monthly unit rate well below public cloud alternatives.  We also see in the power of the full HPE age-to-cloud portfolio as customers are turning to HPE for integrated solutions, a combined secure connectivity data insight capability, and cloud experiences. Woolworths Group, Australia and New Zealand's largest retailer selected HPE GreenLake to power its new Wpay payment platform. They needed a solution that combined a powerful mission-critical architecture, with the ability to scale and also provided better cost efficiency back to Wpay and its Merchants Partners. Delivered through HPE GreenLake, their solution leverages our full age-to-cloud portfolio, including HP Aruba, HPE NonStop, HPE Primera, and HPE Synergy.  HPE Pointnext services also provided expertise to us over the Company's digital transformation. I believe this is a great example of the power of our HPE supply portfolio. To extend our leadership position in cloud services and further accelerate our pivot to as-a-service, we are relentlessly . We made several compelling announcements at HPE Discover in June. I am particularly excited about our new HPE GreenLake lighthouse offering. A secure cloud-native stack built with HPE Ezmeral software to autonomously optimize different workloads across the hybrid state, reducing time to deployment, and operating costs. We also introduced Project Aurora, to secure the enterprise.  Embedded in our HPE GreenLake aids to cloud platform Project Aurora automatically, and continuously verifies an attack. The integrity of the hardware, freeware, operating systems, platforms, and workloads, while also detecting advanced trends. And finally, demonstrating our continued commitment to our  assets that complement our own capabilities, we acquired a data platform developer, Ampool. Ampool will accelerate the HP Ezmeral analytics run-time, to deliver high-performance analytics for engineers and business analysts. I am proud of HP's performance in Q3 and year-to-date. And the significant progress we have made in becoming the edge cloud Company.  The momentum we have in the market compels us to move even further and faster. And our ability to transform with increasing speed is imperative. Transformation is my number one priority. At this pivotal moment, our purpose to advance the way people live and work has never been more important. Our vision to become the edge to cloud Company is  its tremendous relevance. And our portfolio is winning in the marketplace. Fueled by our purpose, vision, and portfolio, we have the opportunity to build a more discipline-enabled inclusive work.  We have a mandate to imagine new digital transformation strategies that support our own ESG goals and those of our customers, leading to better business outcomes and societal impact. We will never waiver from our commitment to being a force for good, and a strategic partner for our customers. We will continue to bring both new innovations to our customers, and we will continue to create value for our shareholders, and I'm grateful for the incredible team and I'm confident in and excited about the future. I hope you will join us for our virtual security analyst meeting on October 28, to hear more about our position in the market, our priorities, and our outlook for the year ahead. I will now turn it over to Tarek. No, the only thing I will say maybe is that listen, Tarek made this comment in his remarks, is the fact of the matter on the high-end -- on the top end of that balance we give you 1.7 billion, is almost the same number we achieved in 2020 -- 2019.  And therefore, in many ways, we are almost a year ahead of our commitment because if you'll recall, we said we're going to return to normalized free cash flow in 2022. In the reality, even when you finance these large deals that eventually we're going to communicate has nothing to do with the NSA deal.  We are already almost at the same number, so that's why we are so pleased with the momentum that we have. But it's a momentum based on the order growth, and all the actions we have taken, and the deliberate shift in our portfolio to higher margins. And that's what you see in our numbers in Q3, right? It's a record-breaking gross margin of 34.7%. Yeah, thanks, Simon, for the question. I will start, and then I will let Tarek comment. Listen, we take pricing actions all the time. In fact, we probably have the first to take pricing action in our industry, I will say. We continue to assess what is the right strategy by segment and making sure that we take those actions where appropriate.  The fact of the matter is that we have increased pricing even concrete. That's a fact. And we do that in a context of, obviously, supply availability, steep in demand in the right portfolio, and obviously, inflationary costs associated with some of the commodities.  At the same time, remember there is also new innovation against building our products, which has a structural impact in the sense that when you look at our infrastructure, new technologies drive two-thirds of the pricing in many ways in AOPs, but we could take close the actions all the time, Simon, and we will continue to do so.  And that's part of the reason also while we see record-breaking margins but in addition to the fact that we're still in the demand in the right place and driving that mix shift that we talked about before. So Tarek, I know you want to get more specific, probably. Well, we are very confident in the sense that we have taken proactive actions. We continue to take proactive actions that can imagine a person evolve with some of this conversation with suppliers. But if you look at our order buffering -- sorry, inventory buffering we talked about, right? Our inventory is up 1.3 billion.  And at the same time, we have, I think, one of the best-in-class engineering teams that they can swap things as we go along the way. That said, as a look at this order book, there is so much potential upside here. Is all about that daily conversion.  And so far, once we -- we have not seen any cancellations. Just to be clear, when people ask me, hey, this is perishable? No, I can tell you, the answer is definitely, no. I think it's because also customers realize it's not just a supply constraint, but a need to provision more Compute and data insight capabilities.  And then, as I said earlier, even despite the fact that our Intelligent Edge business exited with a 5 times backlog on that unique segment of the market, we still delivered 23% in constant currency, 27% growth.  And that's why what Tarek said, we expect revenue to continue to grow, and in particular '22. And then to the question that was asked earlier about margin, the margin should strengthen over time because of the mix shift, and that Aruba is very important to us.  But fundamentally, I think our edge-to-cloud vision and strategy is absolutely resonating in the market because customers need three things. They need secured connectivity in this hybrid world. They need a cloud experience everywhere.  And then, they need data insights yesterday, in my view. And then, we need to be able to consume it as-a-service in an elastic way. We have all the forward ingredients, and that's why we're going to accelerate further and faster with this strategy because it's working. Yeah, let me start, and Tarek is welcome to -- Listen, as you said, right? This business is lumpy because it kind of takes to book the order to build the ship and install it. And then most importantly, the customer accepts the order, meaning the workload that was intended to run on is active -- is in production.  And we normally see this trend accelerate in the back half of the year because of the way the acceptances work. So we absolutely expect a significant uptick here. And that's why we are very confident in our ability to deliver for the year 2021 the 8 to 12% growth that we committed.  Since the beginning actually of 2021. And we have a number of deals that are all now running the -- what we call the testing cycles. And fairly confident about the customer acceptances, which would allow us to recognize revenue.  This has nothing to do with supply availability in many ways because, obviously, those assistants, in many ways, have already shipped and they're already deployed. It just getting through the cycle for the customer to get the performance that they need.  And there is quite a bit of tuning that does get done when the systems are deployed. But to Tarek's point, the demand is unbelievably strong. Put aside the $2 billion award that we got yesterday, we announced yesterday, we continue to win multiple multi-million-dollar deals in many aspects. And you can see some of those as we announced throughout the quarter.  And that's the power of the portfolio we have in high-performance computing, and specifically, two  are in people earning capabilities. And by the way, we have $2.5 billion of award the business, which I don't consider backlog, is business that will be delivered over the next 12-18 months. In particular, the large Exascale systems, which are an amazing feat of technology, I will say. Well, thank you, Shannon. I mean, we are incredibly bullish about this business. I think we have a competitive advantage. And the competitive advantage comes from many aspects. One is the software.  Software that makes this consumption model a true consumption model, unlike some of the other ones were trying to catch up, which is more financial engineering in many ways. Understand everybody's getting into the space, but we have years of leadership here.  And the conversation goes as simple as this. I want the cloud experience on Prime and at the Edge. And we can bring that through Greenlake because it's a true cloud experience that you can consume elastically on a per-unit measure that we can measure all the way to core levels.  And be able to automate the whole experience through our software stack, which obviously HBS model now, it's becoming a very important component of that. And that's why Tarek made the comment earlier as we go through the end of October, we are going to give a little better disclosure of that because the software content with ARR continues to increase.  Aruba by definition Shannon, is really old software, right? And he said that the triple-digit growth is happening in our business because you are subscribing to get connectivity. And our platform is a cloud platform that scales because we manage now more than 1.5 million devices.  But it's more than a pool, I would say. When customers are becoming way more sophisticated about the hybrid state, whether show hosted data, and whether show . They realize that the vast majority is still on-premise.  And many of them will stay on-premise. It's just economics and physics. And we can deliver some experience on-prem and still give them a hybrid experience by managing the workloads and  outside the four walls.  And Greenlake is absolute to resonate and that's why you see us catering everything to Greenlake, whether it's connectivity, whether its data services, whether it is elastically computed. And more world-optimized services as we go along.  And that's why I said earlier, this is all about acceleration on that. And between now and March, you're going to see a massive acceleration. And that's why it's my number one priority. And by the way, as revenue is accretive from a gross margin perspective, so, Tarek, you want to talk about that. I think it will be definitely recognized over time. There will be periods that will be a little bit lumpier because of the infrastructure, but start recognizing here in 2022 immediately. In fact, we're expecting here the first order to happen now and start shipping soon.  But obviously, the one thing you need to understand about this deal, it's not just about selling infrastructure and consumer-as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake is the true as-a-Service model and management at the same time. We are operating the whole environment, which is very different from then used to be in the past. Listen, I expect this business to continue to grow double-digits, right? We're very confident with that forecast. And honestly, maintaining or improve it even, the level of profitability because as Tarek made the comment earlier, right?  This quarter was impacted by a settlement on a legal matter that has been going on for a decade. And so, I'm pleased that that finally has completed, which was $17 million that we booked for this and has nothing to do with Aruba. It just happened way before Aruba for that matter. And so, the reason why I'm confident is that we have a unique value proposition. The value proposition of Aruba is mobile-first cloud-first, which is based on three layers.  One is the unification of the network for whatever type of connectivity you need, which is Wi-Fi and to the point, Wi-Fi 6 is now been adopted, and we are, I think, the largest vendor shipping Wi-Fi access points, second is obviously LAN, third is WAN, and that's why this acquisition has been incredibly well-received by our customers.  And very timely because it's integrated now in the same control plane. And going forward, we're going to integrate more solutions like 5G and Edge computing, and that's why this Edge-to-Cloud platform is essential.  But the Aruba Edge platform is what allows us to deliver the entire Edge-to-Cloud platform because now that platform also serves as the backend to deliver iAS for customer's on-prem and at the Edge for computer installers too, including data services or workload-optimized solutions.  So super pleased. And remember what I said, we exit Q3 2021 with a five times backlog on a normal run rate in that Aruba, and the bookings were very, very strong, super strong. Yes. So again, thank you for taking the time today. Again, we are very pleased with our Q3 result, which again was marked by the older strong momentum in line with revenue expectations, but most importantly, strong improvement in gross and operating margin, and record year-to-date orders and free cash flow.  And that gives us the confidence to, once again, for the fourth time in the year, raise EPS and free cash flow and enter 2022 with good visibility about what we think is going to happen. I'm particularly bullish about the IT spends cycle.  People ask me, what do you think the Delta virus is going to do? It is going to do nothing on demand. I can tell you that now. It may have some impact on supply availability, but nothing on-demand, let me be clear about that.  And the reason why is because customers need to digitize their business, they need to create a more IT environment, and honestly, they need to extract insight from the data at a pace we've never seen before, and our Edge-to-Cloud platform strategy is resonating. So thank you for taking the time to be with us today, and hope to catch up at the end of October at the Securities Analyst Meeting."

            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2021. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slides 1 and 2. So now, let me discuss our Q3 performance starting with Slide 3. I'm pleased to report that we are experiencing very strong demand across all of our businesses. Q3 was marked by accelerating order growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion, and robust cash flow generation.  Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter. And in line with normal sequential seasonality. Also, in line with our outlook that factored in summer off of the expected supply chain constraints we flagged. We are working to ensure disruption is minimal by taking proactive measures and coordinating with our world-class suppliers to establish tailored recovery plans. I am particularly proud of our non-GAAP gross margin that hit another record level of 34.7%, up 40 basis points sequentially, and up 420 basis points from the prior-year period.  This is driven by our deliberate actions to shift towards the higher-margin, software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline, and cost takeout. As previously indicated, we continue to invest in high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio, both in R&D and go-to-market, particularly in Aruba software and as-a-Service, which increased our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter.  We also booked two one-time charges in total $28 million for a legal settlement and bad debt associated with likely fraud, involving a channel partner in APJ. Even with these investments and one-time charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 25% year-over-year increase in operating profit. We continue to be focused on driving further efficiencies in the business. Within other income and expenses, we benefited from stronger operational performance in HPC and strong gains related to increasing valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio.  As a result, we now expect other income and expenses for fiscal year '21 to be an income of approximately 50 million. With strong execution across the business and despite 2 unanticipated one-time charges, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, up 31% from the prior year and above the higher end of our outlook range for Q3. Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $526 million. This puts us at the record $1.5 billion of year-to-date free cash flow, up 1.1 billion from the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in operating profit.  Finally, the strength of our business has positioned us to contribute substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $157 million of dividends in the quarter, and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October. We are also announcing today the resumption of share buybacks as a result of greater free cash flow generation and visibility. I'll come back to capital allocation more broadly when we discuss the outlook. Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4. Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total Company revenue, are executing strongly and experiencing record order levels. In the Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our topline momentum with record levels of orders, and 23% year-over-year revenue growth. Switching was up over 20% year-over-year, whereas wireless LAN experienced more acute supply constraints and was up mid-single-digits.  Additionally, the Edge as a Service offering was up triple-digits year-over-year, which reflects enabling software platforms, as well as network-as-a-service. We also continue to see strong operating margins at 15.8% in Q3, up 540 basis points year-over-year, which included 17 million one-time legal settlements that impacted margins by 2 points.  continues to perform strongly and contributed 7 points to the Intelligent Edge growth. In addition, we started generating meaningful revenue synergies by cross-selling the Aruba portfolio, which reinforces the merits of the Silver Peak deal.  In HPC & MCS, demand strengthened even further with a record order level. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer accepting milestones and deliver on more than $2.5 billion of awarded contracts, including the contract that Antonio mentioned with the NSA worth $2 billion over 10 years. We remain on track to deliver on our full-year and three-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%. In Compute, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting normal sequential seasonality despite previously anticipated supply chain tightness. operating margins of 11.2% were up 190 basis points from the prior year, due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment.  Within storage, revenue grew 1% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter ahead of normal sequential seasonality, driven by strong growth and software-defined offerings. Nimble grew 10% year-over-year with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double-digits year-over-year. All-flash Arrays grew by over 30% year-over-year, led by Primera. The mix shift towards more software-rich platforms helped to drive storage operating margins to 15.1%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, offset by continued investments in our cloud data services. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter, year-over-year as reported with both order and revenue growth expected for fiscal year '21.  Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was flat year-over-year and sequentially, while our bad net loss ratio did increase slightly to 94 basis points this quarter, it was entirely due to a one-time 11 million reserve charge related to the already mentioned likely fraud in APJ by a channel partner. Optioned for this one-off event, our bad debt loss ratio would have improved to just 61 basis points, aligned to pre-pandemic levels. More importantly, we continue to see improved cash collections above pre-pandemic levels. Our operating margin was 11.1% up 300 basis points from the prior year, and our Return on Equity at 18.3%, is well above the 15% plus target set at SAM.  Slide 5 highlights the key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. We have made significant progress since our Analyst Day last October by adding over 200 new enterprises, Greenlake customers, to over 1,100 today. And increasing our TCV by over $1 billion to our current lifetime TCV of well over $5 billion. For Q3, specifically, our ARR was $705 million, which was up 33% year-over-year, as reported and total as-a-Service orders were up 46% year-over-year. It is also important to note that the mix of our ARR is becoming more and more software-rich, as we build out our Greenlake cloud platform, which is improving our margin profile.  We look forward to providing more disclosure around our software and services mix at our Analyst Day later this fall, which I believe reinforces a significant value-add of Greenlake. Overall, based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth target of 30% to 40% CAGR from FY20 to FY23. Slide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year, and sustained momentum for the last 3 quarters. The demand environment continues to strengthen, and with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q3 by 31% year-over-year.  Turning to Slide 7, we delivered another record, non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q3 of 34.7% of revenues, which was up 40 basis points sequentially, and up 420 basis points on the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation storage offerings. We have also benefited from the new segmentation we implemented beginning of the fiscal year 2020. That gives us much better visibility into each business unit and enables a better resource allocation and discipline to drive operating leverage.  Moving to Slide 8, you can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margins substantially from pandemic lows to 9.8%, which is up 190 basis points from the prior-year period. We are driving further productivity benefits, and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan, while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fueling our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. As mentioned previously, Q3 operating expenses also included one-time charges not included in our guidance, totaling $28 million for a legal settlement, and the likely fraud scheme involving a partner.  Excluding these one-off charges, our operating margin would have been 10.2%. Turning to slide 9, we generated record year-to-date levels of cash flow with $2.9 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.5 billion of free cash flow, which is up to $1.1 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by increased operating profit. I would like also to underscore that this year, our free cash flow seasonality will be different than in prior years. We expect increased financial services volume that includes more than $150 million in Q4 financing for a very large deal that is predominantly Greenlake and will benefit our ARR and margins for years to come.  We also have further restructured payments, and growing working capital needs as we continue to buffer our inventory levels in the light of the disruption in the global IT supply chain. Now moving on to Slide 10, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified Balance Sheet. As of July 31st, the Operating Company's net cash balance turned positive due to our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we made additional progress during the quarter securitizing over $750 million of financial services-related debt through the ABS market.  The refinancing of higher costs unsecured debt with ABS financing, allows us to boost access to the financing market at a cheaper cost of debt capital, as well as diversify and segregate our Balance Sheet between our operating Company and our financial services business. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity to our operations, continuing to invest in our business to drive growth and return capital to shareholders.  Now, turning to our outlook on Slide 11, I'm very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full-year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in a demanding environment and our strong execution. This will be the fourth guidance increase since SAM in October 2020, we now expect to deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.88 and $1.96. With respect to supply chain, as indicated last quarter, industry-wide tightening somewhat constrained our supply as expected. We continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible.  And you can see our efforts in inventory balances that increased $1.3 billion year-to-date, which also reflects the strengthening demand environment and a substantial order book we have across the business. We expect the challenge supply chain conditions to persist until at least the middle of the calendar year 2022, and have factored these into our revenues, costs, and cash flow outlook. From a top-line perspective, although we remain prudent, given the chance supply chain environment, we are very pleased with the accelerating Q3 order momentum across all segments of the business.  More specifically, for Q4 '21, we expect revenue to be above our normal sequential seasonality from Q3 and are comfortable with current consensus levels. For Q4 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.14 to $0.22 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.52. Additionally, given our record levels, our free cash flow year-to-date, and confidence in our raised outlook, I'm very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year '21 free cash flow guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. That is a $600 million increase at the midpoint from our original sand guidance with the top end of this free cash flow guidance range at the peak levels attained in fiscal year '19.  As you recall, at the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2020, we suspended our share buybacks to preserve liquidity in the context of the global pandemic disruption. Although we continue to operate in a challenging supply environment, our order momentum and improved cash flow generation visibility give us the confidence to reinstate our share repurchase program. We are targeting up to $250 million of share repurchases in Q4 of fiscal year '21 and will update investors on our capital management policy for fiscal year '22 at SAM in October. As a reminder, we always follow a disciplined return-based capital allocation framework to maximize long-term shareholder value.  Our number one priority remains to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, through both organic and inorganic M&A investments while remaining committed to paying dividends to our shareholders. In addition, we will consider opportunistic share buybacks when we see a favorable return for doing so. So overall, and to conclude, I am very proud of the progress we have made year-to-date in fiscal year 21. It's clear that our Edge-to-Cloud strategy is resonating with customers, and driving improved momentum across all of our businesses.  Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC MCS have accelerated top-line performance with record levels of orders. Our core business of Compute and storage is demonstrating momentum with robust orders and improved margins, and our as-a-Service ARR is accelerating. All of this translates to improving revenue momentum, strong profitability growth, and record levels of free cash flow. We look forward to closing out our fiscal year much leaner, better resourced, and positioned to capitalize on the strong demand environment.  Lastly, as Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us for our virtual Securities Analyst Meeting in late October, where we will provide an update on our strategy, business insights, and financial outlook. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Sure. Thank you, Amit for the question. Yes, our free cash flow for Q4 is north of 100 million, it's actually implied in our guidance about 150 million in Q4. And this figure reflects a different seasonal profile that we have had this year in terms of our revenue and expense profile, but also a couple of very important dynamics that I would like to underscore.  First of all, we have to continue to make investments in our inventory level to withstand the supply chain constraints that we flagged for several quarters now. Second, in Q4 of fiscal year '21, in my script, I described a very, very large Greenlake deal that will impact free cash flow in Q4, but that will generate substantial ARR revenue in subsequent quarters.  This is a deal in several $100 million that we have not announced yet, but it is already something that we're financing. And this is affecting therefore free cash flow already as of Q4 of fiscal year '21. Thirdly, we are still peaking on restructuring costs in fiscal year '21 and we feel very positive about our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which will wind down at the end of fiscal year '22.  And so this is a nice segue to tell you about our guidance towards fiscal year '22 and the 2 billion targets that we have. We continue to expect revenue growth in fiscal year '22 with the momentum that carries out of fiscal year '21, and also the restructuring cost program winding down will be a key determinant of our generation of free cash flow in fiscal year '22. So hopefully I gave you color there. Does Antonio want to add something? Thank you, Antonio, and thank you, Simon, for the question. We have in this context where you have a constrained supply environment to be very careful around managing to price, right? And we have taken action that is translating in this record level of gross margin of 34.7%.  Some of our competitors didn't take that action, and it's down to them and up to them. But we feel that the current environment is calling for additions that approach to pricing. And we see an encouraged, balanced pricing behavior across the market. So more specifically, with respect to our units in AUP and Compute. I'm sure someone will ask the question. AUP was up to mid to high single-digits quarter-on-quarter reflecting pass-through of commodity costs and richer configurations. As always, configurations that are richer play a big rolling in the AUP, but also, pricing in this case. And units were flat quarter-over-quarter, given some expected supply chain constraints. So we feel pretty good about performance in computing.  In that regard, it's still a business that we have to manage very, very carefully on a day-to-day basis because the supply environment being volatile forces us to do so. But we still see scope for continuous gross margin improvement across the board and in Compute as well. So, let me pick up the first question on the normalized seasonality. Typically, what you observe in terms of sequential quarter-over-quarter growth, I would say it's somewhere in the low single-digits around the 1% to 2% range between Q3 and Q4.  So Q4 and Q3 growth are about that level. Like I said in my script, I'm comfortable with the current consensus on revenue for Q4, and we feel pretty good about this. The order book is very, very solid. Antonio underscored this. Across the board, our order book is super solid. Now the question is, how much of that can be really accelerated in terms of conversion in Q4?  And it's, every day is another day, so we're working through that. And this obviously has an impact on gross margins, right? Because the more you wait for fulfilling an order, the more you can have an adverse impact on gross margins. But we feel fairly comfortable with us managing this dynamic and particularly leveraging or pulling the levers across the board that we have such as our revenue mix.  I want to highlight to you the continuous growth in Aruba. This level of growth in Aruba on our Intelligent Edge business of 23% comes with very high-calorie revenue, and we feel very, very comfortable and pleased with that trend.  Also, our growth in storage, which comes with very high-calorie gross margin revenue, is pleasing at 3%. We took share from some of our main competitors, and this gives you an idea that we have a few strings in our bow, so to speak, to actually continue to drive gross margins to better levels. And on the -- if I can add to Antonio's comments. In my mind, there is no point crying over spilled milk. If we could have converted more, we would have converted more, but it doesn't really matter.  The order momentum and the order book remained strong. And what we didn't convert in Q3 will convert in Q4 and subsequent quarters. To specifically give you an idea of where we would have ended in Q3. We probably would have ended above seasonal trends that we see between Q2 and Q3 by a low-single-digit percentage number. But the momentum is very strong in Q4 and also for '22, that's the interesting bit.  In the environment that we're operating in, the demand is very solid and with the supply constraints, we don't see them ending before the first half of calendar year '22. So we just have to navigate this as the capacity of all our manufacturing partners is not back to pre-pandemic levels, and that will still take a good 2 to 3 quarters. Yeah, absolutely. So, Shannon, what I would say is, if you refer back to Slide 5 of our investor presentation, we showed the stack of revenue that composes our AUR, right? So our Greenlake revenue is across all segments, our Compute HPC MCS, storage, Aruba, and also HPFS as you can infer from that slide.  And the more we drive Greenlake by way of software, the more accretive it is to the overall gross margin of the Company. That's a key lever to drive gross margin moving forward. We're driving gross margin across every single stream lane through the revenue mix, and across also that revenue mix horizontally by way of pivoting the Company to become an as-a-Service Company.  So far, what I can tell you is that the Greenlake gross margin is substantially higher than the average gross margin of the Company that we posted today. And we look forward, Antonio and I to update you and every other member of the analyst's community at our virtual SAM event in October highlighting to you where we see the ARR growing.  And it's mixed by segment moving forward. And in composition, how much of it is software and how much of it comes from other types of revenue streams such as point NExOS, which are very important to the profitability of the Company."

With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\nAntonio Neri: Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. While great progress is made in the fight against COVID, it\u2019s also clear that it\u2019s still a global challenge. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the suffering occurring in India and elsewhere as communities confront devastating COVID surges. We will continue to do everything we can to support our team members, customers and communities through this very challenging time.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. I\u2019ll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year \u201821. As usual, I\u2019ll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on slide 1, and now, let me discuss our financial performance, starting with slide 2. I am very pleased to report that our Q2 results reflect continued momentum in revenue, strong gross and operating margin expansion, and robust cash flow generation. We delivered Q2 revenues of $6.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year period, a level better than our normal sequential seasonality. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin is at the record level of 34.3%, up 210 basis points from the prior year period and up 60 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher margin software-rich offering. Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased in the quarter, as we previously indicated, due to the planned hiring increases along with R&D and go-to-market investments. This offset by our continued progress delivering on the savings from our cost optimization plan, which is on track. Even with our investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 10.2%. That is up 300 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 59% year-over-year increase in operating profit. Within other income and expense, we benefited from onetime gains related to increased valuations in our Cohesity and IonQ investments within our Pathfinder venture portfolio. As a result, we now expect other income and expense for the full year in fiscal year \u201821 to be an expense of approximately $50 million. With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.46, up 70% from the prior year and meaningfully above the higher end of our outlook range for Q2. Q2 cash flow from operations was $822 million and free cash flow was $368 million, up $770 million from the prior year, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital benefits. This puts us at a record level of free cash flow for the first half at $931 million. Finally, we paid $156 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q3 dividend today of $0.12 per share, payable in July. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment highlights on slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities to meet robust customer demand, delivering 17% year-over-year revenue growth across the portfolio. Switching was up 17% year-over-year, and wireless LAN was up 16%. Additionally, the Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year and now represent a meaningful contribution to HPE\u2019s overall ARR. We also continued to see strong operating margins at 15.5% in Q2, up 320 basis points year-over-year, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin expansion. Silver Peak continues to perform well, leveraging the high-growth SD-WAN market opportunity and contributed about 5 points to the Intelligent Edge top line growth. In HPC-MCS, revenue grew 11% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer acceptance milestones and deliver on our more than $2 billion of awarded contracts. We remain on track to deliver on our full year and three-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%. In compute, revenue grew 10% year-over-year and was down just 1% sequentially, reflecting much stronger than normal sequential seasonality. Operating margins were up meaningfully year-over-year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.3%, up 550 basis points from the prior year period and towards the upper range of our long-term margin guidance for these segments provided at SAM. Within storage, revenue grew 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. Nimble grew 17% with ongoing strong dHCI momentum growing triple digits. All-flash arrays grew 20% year-over-year, led by Primera that was up triple digits and is expected to surpass 3PAR sales next quarter. The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms and operational execution helped drive storage operating profit margin to 16.8%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the second consecutive quarter year-over-year as reported with further growth expected for the full year of fiscal year \u201821. This has been driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling product and service bundles, improved service intensity and our growing as-a-service business, which I\u2019ll remind you, involves service attach rates of 100%. This is very, very important to note because all of our OS revenue is recurring with three-year average contract length, and OS is the highest operating margin contributor to our segments. Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was down 3% year-over-year as the pandemic did not materially impact this business until later in 2020. As expected, we are seeing continued sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios ending this quarter at just 75 basis points, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. We have also seen improved cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. Our operating margin in this segment was 10.8%, up 160 basis points from the prior year and our return on equity at 18.3% is well above pre-pandemic levels and the 15%-plus target that we set at SAM. Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we are making great strides in our as-a-service offering with over 90 new enterprise GreenLake customers added. That is in Q2, bringing the total to well over 1,000. I am pleased to report that our Q2 \u201821 ARR was $678 million, which was up 30% year-over-year, as reported. Total as-a-service orders were up 41% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in North America and Central Europe. Our Edge-as-a-Service offerings also continued to grow revenue strong triple digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth targets of 30% to 40%, a CAGR from FY20 to FY23. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date where you can clearly see the strong rebound and momentum from our Q2 \u201820 trough. For the past two quarters, revenue has exceeded our normal sequential seasonality, reflecting the improving demand environment. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q2 by 70% year-over-year. Turning to slide 6. We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q2 of 34.3% of revenues, which was up 60 basis points sequentially and up 210 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, operational services margin expansion from cost takeout and automation, and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses, like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation storage offering. We have also benefited from the new segmentation we implemented beginning of fiscal year \u201820 that has given us much better visibility into each business unit and enabled better operational discipline. Moving to slide 7. You can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margin substantially from pandemic lows of -- to 10.2%, which is up 300 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. Q2 operating expenses also included planned increased hiring and spending on select investment to drive further growth. Turning to slide 8. We generated record first half levels of cash flow with $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and $931 million of free cash flow, which is up $1.5 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some in year timing-related benefits. I would like to underscore that this year, our free cash flow profile seasonality will be different as a result of our backend-loaded restructuring costs and investment in inventory for our supply chain to cater for rising demand and chip shortages as the economic recovery accelerates. Now, moving on to slide 9, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet. As of April 30th quarter end, we have improved the operating company to a net cash neutral position with our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we have made good progress securitizing some financial services-related debt through the ABS market and expect to have close to all of the U.S. portfolio securitized by year-end. The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at a cheaper cost of debt capital as well as diversifying and segregating our balance sheet between our operating company and our financial services business. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business, drive growth and execute on our strategy. Now, turning to our outlook on slide 10. I am very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in the demand environment and our strong operational performance to date. This will be our third guidance increase in SAM in October 2020. We now expect to grow non-GAAP operating profit by 25% to 35% and deliver fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.82 and $1.94. This is a $0.09 per share improvement at the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.88 and a $0.22 per share improvement at the midpoint since SAM. With respect to supply chain, we have executed well to date with minimal impact, and continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible. We do see further industry-wide tightening and inflation persisting in the near term, which has been factored in our outlook from both a revenue and cost perspective, but overall demand remains strong. From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in the first half. And while we continue to see further demand improvement, we remain prudent as certain geographies continue to navigate the pandemic, and we continue to observe uncertainties in the supply of commodity. More specifically for Q3 \u201821, we expect revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of up low single digits from Q2. For Q3 \u201821, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.04 to $0.10 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow in the first half and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising FY21 free cash flow guidance to $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. That is a $350 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance. So overall, Antonio and I are very proud of the progress we have made in the first half. We have navigated well through the pandemic and are exiting the first half with improved revenue momentum, strong profitability and robust cash flow. Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC-MCS have accelerated top line performance, our core business of compute and storage revenues are growing with improved margins, and our as-a-service ARR is accelerating. We also continue to execute well against our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which has made us leaner, better resourced and positioned to capitalize on the economic recovery currently at play. Now, with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Thank you.\nOperator:  The first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. And congrats on another beat and full year free cash flow raise. I was wondering if you can dig a little bit more into the guidance dynamics. You\u2019re guiding 3Q a little bit below The Street, 4Q slightly higher. Can you maybe address what the visibility you have into 4Q is? And how much of supply chain impact are you baking in into 3Q, 4Q? Is that both the demand and the cost level? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. Wamsi, hi. It\u2019s Tarek here. So, let me try and dissect the guidance we gave for Q3 and also the full year. So, putting things in perspective. First, you know we are raising our FY21 EPS outlook by $0.09 at the midpoint to $1.82 to $1.94 based on our Q2 outperformance. And we feel very confident for the rest of the year. This reflects what we see as continued improvement in customer spending, but also we want to remain prudent given the remaining pandemic and supply chain uncertainty. Specifically for Q3, it\u2019s important to note that we do expect revenue growth in line with normal FY18, FY19 sequential seasonality of up low single digits. We anchored you on FY18, FY19 and not last year because of the disruption we suffered in the supply chain last year. So, it\u2019s better to look at it from an FY18, FY19 viewpoint. You should expect that gross margins hold roughly flat relative to our H1 levels, near just under 34%. OpEx should be up somewhat as we continue to make select investments aligned to our strategy in key growth areas, and this is partially offset by further efficiencies we find. But most importantly, it is important that you note that OI&E will flip to an expense overall in the full year, and therefore, in the second half. OI&E in Q1 was a positive income and Q2 was a positive income. And now we\u2019re expecting for the full year \u201821 a $50 million expense, hence, the guidance that we\u2019re giving you overall for Q3. You can expect that the tax rate will be unchanged at 14%, like we said at SAM. And the net of all of this is that we expect our Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.44, and we feel pretty comfortable about it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. And thank you. I just wanted to ask your take on the forward guidance, which implies low-single-digit sequential growth following above seasonal quarter in the April quarter. It sounds like backlog continues to be strong. So, are there particular pockets of areas where you\u2019re seeing a slowdown or maybe more cautious outlook for -- from customers because they\u2019re still dealing with the pandemic issues?\nAntonio Neri: Maybe I\u2019ll start. I know Tarek has many comments. I mean, we see strong demand momentum right now. We quoted in our remarks that we\u2019re up mid-single-digits. And therefore, we translate that conversion into revenue. But obviously, part of the improvement could come from the HPC acceptances. Remember that on HPC, our order to revenue is a little bit more lumpy because of the time between orders and revenue takes longer. But overall, what we are confident is the fact that we see obviously IT demand improving. But I\u2019m really pleased with our innovation and our ability to execute against that innovation. The innovation we have across the portfolio is perfectly timed what we see in today\u2019s environment. We live in a much more distributed enterprise. Obviously, digital transformation is essential to operate in this digital economy, and the first step is connectivity. And I have to tell you, the Intelligent Edge business is absolutely incredibly strong. You saw in actual dollars, almost 20%. And we expect to continue to be super strong for the balance of the year into 2022, honestly. And that\u2019s because we have a business scale. We have a massive business scale. And to give a point of reference, we already have 100,000 customers on that platform. We have 150 customers every day. We manage more than 1.1 million devices. And honestly, we actually manage data of 1 billion plus per hour, data points that comes through our cloud. And so, we expect that to continue to be very strong. I think, the core business has definitely stabilized. And we see pockets of improvement, particularly with storage. And then, the as-a-service will continue to stay strong. Again, we are cautious about the supply chain aspect of this. But, we position ourselves well for the second half, and that was all factored in our guidance, absolutely well factored in our guidance. So, it\u2019s why we raised the guidance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. My congrats on the quarter as well. I want to come back, Tarek, to just reconciling the improving growth trajectory in all of your segments with the second half EPS guidance that assumes well below normal seasonality or about 40% of EPS coming in the back half versus past years. You typically have low to mid-50% second half EPS mix. I think, I heard you mention supply chain constraints and being cautious around that and COVID and general cost inflation, investments you\u2019re making and then OI&E dynamics. Can you just rank those -- well, first, did I forget any? And then, can you just rank those factors in terms of which are having the most impact on your back half EPS guidance? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. Thank you, Katy. So, let me try and add a little bit more color to what we said already. So, first of all, remember, our cost optimization and allocation program. We exited FY20 very lean, and this has driven a very strong performance in Q1 at $0.52 per share. This is a level of earnings that was actually benefiting from the fact that we have a very strong run rate entering into Q1. In Q2, you saw that momentum continuing with the EPS that we posted at $0.46 per share. Very comfortable with the level of investments that we are making, and this is also showing in the gross and operating margin expansion that we\u2019ve demonstrated so far. So, now, when you also look at how this translates into free cash flow, obviously, we had a lot of free cash flow benefits into Q1, Q2 as a result of the earnings strength and which translated into free cash flow. But moving forward, what you have to factor into the guidance on earnings is the fact that there is some degree of uncertainty on supply chain. Although, as Antonio said, the demand is very strong across the board. The demand is very strong in Aruba. The demand is very strong in Compute. And you can see that with units going up year-over-year. And also in HPC-MCS, we are seeing the revenue trending in the range that we guided at SAM. This is all good. Having said that, we have also to reckon two other dynamics. Aside from the cost optimization program and the demand, the other dynamic is OI&E, which affects EPS in Q3 and Q4. Q1, Q2, we had two income quarters as far as OI&E is concerned. They\u2019ll flip into an expense of $50 million for the full year, gives you an order of magnitude of what would be the EPS for each one of Q3, Q4. And then, on free cash flow, the other final element that drives it is we have to deal with supply chain, and we continue to buffer inventory to be ready for the demand in fiscal year \u201821 for the second half, but also fiscal year \u201822. We do not expect that the situation on inventory is going to be all of a sudden setting up across the world and across the industries, and we\u2019ve taken steps, and we\u2019ll continue to do so. So overall, we\u2019re managing, I would say, the resurgent demand environment very well. We\u2019re lean from an organization standpoint. Our earnings power is shown by the margins we\u2019re posting. And also, you could see that what we\u2019re doing on free cash flow, we\u2019re doing very, very well. So hopefully, that gives you a color to your questions with the rankings of the various effects at play.\nAntonio Neri: Katy, this is Antonio. I just want to reinforce a couple of things. I understand the normal sequential seasonality, people trying to get into it. But the fact of the matter is, we are delivering record-breaking gross margin. We are raising our EPS guidance despite the supply chain uncertainty. And our business is in huge demand. And it\u2019s not just the IT demand, it\u2019s the fact that we have unique portfolio, edge-to-cloud, that\u2019s meeting the customer needs of today and future ready for tomorrow. And so, I think the fact is that when you look at the full year, right, we have raised guidance now 3 times. And to Tarek\u2019s point, it\u2019s more than 25% from the beginning of the year. And that\u2019s a testament of the momentum we have in the business. Then obviously, every quarter has ups and downs because of unique things like OI&E or maybe more inventory buildout. But in the end, the takeaway is that we are raising again the EPS for the full year and free cash flow.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKyle McNealy: I wanted to see if you could give us a sense for the position of your compute installed base. We saw F5 had stronger than expected upgrade activity to hardware systems coming out of the worst days of COVID impact. For you guys, how high is the average age of your compute installed base versus normal levels? And are you seeing any upgrade activity start to come through now for on-premise hardware after COVID-related delays last year?\nAntonio Neri: Well, sure. Obviously, we are one of the market leaders today in terms of whatever you look at, revenue, market share. But obviously, our portfolio, which is ProLiant is on the 23 years in the making and our installed base is incredibly large. The average is probably between four, five years, Kyle, at this point in time. Definitely, it\u2019s a pent-up demand to modernize that infrastructure. But, it\u2019s not just replacing hardware for the sake of replacing hardware. It\u2019s to really bring that cloud experience to our computer source and more and more be able to consume it elastically as-a-service. And that\u2019s the unique value proposition we have, which is not only just the best infrastructure with ProLiant as a franchise, but the fact that we have a provisional life cycle management. And you should stay tuned for more announcement here shortly, but also be able to pivot that installed base to more a consumption base over time, and then more and more as a well to optimize solutions. And remember, these platforms come also in a different structure in the sense that you have more options and more technologies built into the platform. And so, for us, it\u2019s a big opportunity. And I think an accelerator of that transition is our GreenLake business. It\u2019s not just replacing the old infrastructure or the CapEx but be able to and repatriate workloads on-prem where it makes sense, or actually hold workloads on-prem because now we can deliver a true cloud experience in our consumption-driven model.\nTarek Robbiati: And let me add to this, Kyle. There\u2019s also another aspect that we see the pent-up demand and really the need to modernize the infrastructure and the way the infrastructure is used. But also, if the decision to actually modernize the infrastructure and moving to consumption isn\u2019t made, it\u2019s not bad for us, because we benefit from extended leasing with our financial services portfolio, which has been doing extremely well with our asset management business as people tend to use the infrastructure more, absent a decision or an availability of supply for the equipment they want to use. So, it\u2019s good for us on all fronts. And we\u2019re very happy with that performance on both, the core compute business and HPFS.\nAntonio Neri: And last but not least, let\u2019s not forget just the hardware is the operational services that come with it, because every upgrade cycle, whether it\u2019s the traditional way or as-a-service, obviously, as-a-service is even better because it comes with 100% attach of Pointnext OS. We have seen richer configurations and higher services attached. And that\u2019s why part of the gross margin expansion you saw in Q2, in compute, which was 550 basis points, comes also after the fact we are attaching more services to our infrastructure.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. And congratulations on the quarter and the raised guide. One of the things that comes up obviously is your asset, H3C. I\u2019m just curious any updated thoughts on how you are thinking about that put optionality, which I believe expires in early \u201822. And how are you thinking about kind of the use of capital? Any kind of thoughts on more flexibility on M&A or any strategic thoughts on that front? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Well, I will start and then Tarek will comment. Listen, we still have roughly a year to make the decision. The put expire in May 2022. Let me remind everybody that obviously China is the second largest IT market and growing. And our setup is unique, is unique in many ways to fulfill the needs of a unique market like China. And I think that joint venture with the partner has been incredibly successful driving shareholder values through H3C level and also through us, right, because obviously, we collect dividends from that joint venture. But it\u2019s a way to reach a market that\u2019s very hard to compete. So, we will continue to relate what is the best use of that capital in the context of participating in China, and we decided to take action what to do with our capital. But right now, we have not decided one way or the other one. We continue to explore what is the best return for shareholders and also to position the Company for growth as we think about the future. I don\u2019t know, Tarek, if you have any comments?\nTarek Robbiati: You said very well, Antonio. We have time to make the decision. The put expires in April 2022. So, we have a little bit less than a year, and that is to sell all or part of our 49% stake in units. We feel that this is a stake that continues to accreting value. Just to put things in perspective for everyone on the call, in fiscal year \u201820 alone, the equity interest contribution from H3C grew over 20% to $212 million for fiscal year \u201820. We expect that growth to continue, and therefore, the value of our stake to continue to accrete.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I was just going to ask about acquisitions in general and your M&A thoughts. It\u2019s been about a year since Silver Peak, a couple of years since MapR. Just I know you\u2019ve made some small acquisitions in the interim, but I\u2019m wondering with the liquidity position you have, the cash flow and your approach to growth where you\u2019re at and what you might think are some holes in your portfolio? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. No, thank you. Obviously, M&A is an important component of our strategy. And as we have done, at least I have done now probably 19 of them, has always has been about, obviously, very stringent return on invested capital, very disciplined in that approach. But it\u2019s always about bringing intellectual property and talent to accelerate our edge-to-cloud platform vision. Silver Peak was completed in September last year and now fully integrated into our business and now we start seeing the momentum in our Intelligent Edge business, and all the ones we are doing along the way, particularly around data and software-defined assets and so forth. So, again, we continue to evaluate what is available there, notwithstanding the fact that we have to be incredibly disciplined. As you know, valuation seems to be a little bit too high for some of the assets. But again, if there is something out there that makes sense, we will evaluate it, and we will take the right action. But again, it\u2019s an important component of our strategy going forward. And I always we talk about the Aruba-like type of things. But we evaluate everything, whatever is relevant for our strategy. I don\u2019t know, Tarek, if you have any comments on that.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. Shannon, I mean, it\u2019s very important to maintain discipline and focus in the content -- in a context where valuations in some cases, particularly for some class of assets, a little bit exuberant. But, if we can find two to three Silver Peak type of acquisitions, I don\u2019t think Antonio and I will hesitate a second to just go and press the button.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I guess, I was hoping if you could talk more about the Intelligent Edge performance. The 17% growth, I think, is more impressive, better than what most of your peers have had on the networking side, other than Arista maybe. So, maybe you can just talk about what is driving the inflection of growth over here? And what is the durability of the double-digit growth really as we go into the back half and beyond? That would be really helpful. And then, if I could ask you to clarify this, because I may have missed it completely. Why is OI&E flipping from positive in the first half to negative in such a big way in the back half?\nAntonio Neri: Sure. I will start, and Tarek will talk about the OI&E. I mean, obviously, if you look about the way we operate and the growth in IoT and the need for connectivity, obviously, is continuing to grow. Interesting enough, three years ago, I said that the enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And it\u2019s played exactly that way. Unfortunately, through the COVID pandemic, we saw that acceleration. But, when you think about digital transformation, right, obviously, we live in a digital economy. And the first step is to be connected. If you\u2019re not connected, you\u2019re not participating. That connectivity is not just any more users and devices as things -- everything is connected to the network, everything computes, everything generates data. And so, connectivity is at the forefront of the digital transformation. And obviously, remote working is requiring the need for Wi-Fi connectivity to a level we haven\u2019t seen before. But, that\u2019s an example of what\u2019s happening out there. But, I will say, our innovation with a true cloud-native platform at massive scale. And again, the fact that we already have 100,000 customers, and we\u2019re adding 150 customers every day, that tells you the value proposition resonated. We can provision a WAN port, a LAN port or a Wi-Fi port or a BLE or Zigbee, whatever is the amount protocol from the cloud. And we\u2019re able to do that in an intelligent and autonomous way. Because ultimately, it\u2019s about the data you collect and what experiences you can provide. And so, we believe this is absolutely durable. We are very bullish about this business. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits for the balance of the year. And as we add more functionality by cloud platform, particularly with edge computing and 5G, we are going to accelerate that momentum. And when you talk to customers and partners, they love the Aruba experience, absolutely love the simplicity, they love the fact that you improve their experience for their own business, and then powers this new way to work. So, that\u2019s why we are pretty excited. And the other thing is that the platform that Aruba runs the cloud is not the platform we run the rest of the Company. When we deploy now one of the data services through the new announcements we made on May 4th, or where we deploy compute or we deploy a workload-optimized is running on the same backend that Aruba was originally created. And that\u2019s why we have a true edge-to-cloud platform. And then, we lay on top of that the as-a-service model, whether it\u2019s subscription and software, which is growing triple digit in Aruba or whether it\u2019s the as-a-service model with GreenLake. And that\u2019s the unique differentiation we have in the marketplace. And that\u2019s why we feel very good about the growth prospect of this business. Tarek, on the OI&E?\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. Thank you, Antonio. On the OI&E front, thanks for asking the question as to why we expect OI&E to flip into a negative in the second half. In OI&E, you have effectively three effects. The first one is the H3C economic contribution and the timing of which shifts between quarters, while like we said before, very happy with H3C and the economic interest that we have through them and the cash they return to us on a regular basis. So, it\u2019s a timing element there for H3C. There is also interest expense that is the second force in the OI&E line. And then, the third force is the Pathfinder portfolio, our venture portfolio, which has been doing extremely well in the first half, and we did flag this in my script. We said we had benefits from revaluations of our investment in Cohesity and IonQ. We had, in the first quarter in OI&E $16 million income in the second quarter, a $27 million income. This is on an aggregate basis across the three forces. So, for the first half, $43 million of OI&E income, and we\u2019re guiding for the full year for an expense of $50 million. So that\u2019s a $90 million swing. And that $90 million swing, if you turn it into an EPS number, divide that to do the math yourself, it\u2019s about $0.07 to $0.08 of EPS for the full year, right? That\u2019s the thing you have to reckon when you compute your Q3 or Q4 EPS forecast. That\u2019s the swing factor there. It does not change the fact that our operating performance remains very, very solid. The swing factor at the OI&E level is explaining a little bit more hopefully the guidance for all of you on the call.\nAntonio Neri: And I will say again, despite all of that, we have raised the guidance.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on solid results and cash flow. My question is on the HPC business. I had expected that that business to grow sequentially, especially after a slowdown in Q1. Maybe it\u2019s just normal seasonality, but understand the businesses could be lumpy. Are there any trends that you can draw from the last two quarters? Whether deals are taking longer to close or being accepted by customers? And more broadly, what gives you confidence that you can hit your 8% to 12% growth target? Maybe you can talk about what\u2019s the normal seasonality for that business in fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4. Thanks.\nAntonio Neri: Let me start. I\u2019m going to talk more for the market. Tarek can talk more on the financial side. Listen, the bookings momentum is incredibly strong in this business. So, you have to look at the booking side and then you have to look at the revenue side. The bookings continue to be just amazing. And I quote some of the deals we won. These are multimillion dollar deals. Seasonality in this business doesn\u2019t really play out that well because the fact of the matter is that you have these large systems that need to be built, shipped, installed, you have to run the workload. And then, only then when the customer accepts the system with the workload running, you can recognize revenue. And that time can vary. It can be as quick as three months, as long as a year in some cases, especially when you deploy these massive exascale systems, which we\u2019re going to do starting end of the year and then next year in 2022. And sometimes you need to run the workload for a month. But reinstalling the system from the factory on the floor, sometimes can take up to 60 days. It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a size of football field. So, I would not think about the seasonality. I think about the long-term growth of the business, we feel pretty good and confident about that CAGR. But, even this year, we believe we\u2019re going to deliver the 8% to 12% growth just this year in 2021, right? So, this is about keeping the orders book momentum, short term, the life cycle of the supply chain and install and acceptance as much as we can. And then, this business is a lot of softer, right, that gets built around the system itself. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019re very bullish about this system and this business. And remember, it\u2019s all on the back of the day. That\u2019s why we talk about AI and deep learning technologies, data continue to grow exponentially, and you need more compute. That\u2019s a fact at the level you haven\u2019t seen before. Tarek, maybe you want to comment on the...\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. You said it very well, Antonio. We simply say, look, the order momentum remains very, very strong. It was up double digits in Q2. We have a large awarded order book with over $2 billion of contracts. The pipeline that we are having in mind includes another $5 billion of exascale opportunity to be awarded over the next three years. The win rates that we observe are very high. We win five out of six contracts in the exascale space. It\u2019s an inherently lumpy business. So, I think if you look at it on a quarterly basis, probably not the best picture. You have to look at it on a multiyear basis. And we feel very confident that we can achieve the 8% to 12% CAGR per year, including starting this year fiscal year \u201821. And because of the lumpiness of the revenue, you also have lumpiness in profitability as a result of the revenue profile and the product mix that doesn\u2019t worry us at all. It\u2019s the nature of the beast, so to speak. We feel that HPC-MCS is extremely well positioned as a business segment, to continue to be a very strong tractor of growth for HPE overall.\nAntonio Neri: And that growth will continue, which, as I said earlier, right, today, the HPC at the edge already represents 22% of the Company\u2019s revenue. And as we go forward with both businesses growing double digits, that 22% will be bigger at the different margin than the core, right? So, anyway, I know we are running out of time. Just to close, I\u2019m very pleased with HPE\u2019s Q2 results that again, they are marked by strong revenue momentum, profitability and free cash flow. The overall demand is improving, but our execution, our innovation is perfectly timed to the customer needs that we see in the marketplace. And despite there is supply chain uncertainty around specific commodities, we factor all that in, in our ability to execute to the back half, and that\u2019s why we are raising once again for the third time in the year, our EPS and free cash flow. And I believe the future is edge-to-cloud, and it\u2019s going to be consumption-based. Well I think HP has a unique value proposition and set of offerings. And that\u2019s why I believe this is a very exciting time for HPE. We have worked really hard, despite the pandemic. Our team has been incredibly resilient. And this Company has a clear purpose to advance the way people live and work. And despite the challenges, we continue to support the communities we are in. So, again, thank you again for joining the call today. And I hope you continue to stay safe and healthy. And talk to you soon.\nAndrew Simanek: Thanks, everyone, operator. I think we can go ahead and close out the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. While great progress is made in the fight against COVID, it's also clear that it's still a global challenge. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the suffering occurring in India and elsewhere as communities confront devastating COVID surges. We will continue to do everything we can to support our team members, customers and communities through this very challenging time. Maybe I'll start. I know Tarek has many comments. I mean, we see strong demand momentum right now. We quoted in our remarks that we're up mid-single-digits. And therefore, we translate that conversion into revenue. But obviously, part of the improvement could come from the HPC acceptances. Remember that on HPC, our order to revenue is a little bit more lumpy because of the time between orders and revenue takes longer. But overall, what we are confident is the fact that we see obviously IT demand improving. But I'm really pleased with our innovation and our ability to execute against that innovation. The innovation we have across the portfolio is perfectly timed what we see in today's environment. We live in a much more distributed enterprise. Obviously, digital transformation is essential to operate in this digital economy, and the first step is connectivity. And I have to tell you, the Intelligent Edge business is absolutely incredibly strong. You saw in actual dollars, almost 20%. And we expect to continue to be super strong for the balance of the year into 2022, honestly. And that's because we have a business scale. We have a massive business scale. And to give a point of reference, we already have 100,000 customers on that platform. We have 150 customers every day. We manage more than 1.1 million devices. And honestly, we actually manage data of 1 billion plus per hour, data points that comes through our cloud. And so, we expect that to continue to be very strong. I think, the core business has definitely stabilized. And we see pockets of improvement, particularly with storage. And then, the as-a-service will continue to stay strong. Again, we are cautious about the supply chain aspect of this. But, we position ourselves well for the second half, and that was all factored in our guidance, absolutely well factored in our guidance. So, it's why we raised the guidance. Katy, this is Antonio. I just want to reinforce a couple of things. I understand the normal sequential seasonality, people trying to get into it. But the fact of the matter is, we are delivering record-breaking gross margin. We are raising our EPS guidance despite the supply chain uncertainty. And our business is in huge demand. And it's not just the IT demand, it's the fact that we have unique portfolio, edge-to-cloud, that's meeting the customer needs of today and future ready for tomorrow. And so, I think the fact is that when you look at the full year, right, we have raised guidance now 3 times. And to Tarek's point, it's more than 25% from the beginning of the year. And that's a testament of the momentum we have in the business. Then obviously, every quarter has ups and downs because of unique things like OI&E or maybe more inventory buildout. But in the end, the takeaway is that we are raising again the EPS for the full year and free cash flow. Well, sure. Obviously, we are one of the market leaders today in terms of whatever you look at, revenue, market share. But obviously, our portfolio, which is ProLiant is on the 23 years in the making and our installed base is incredibly large. The average is probably between four, five years, Kyle, at this point in time. Definitely, it's a pent-up demand to modernize that infrastructure. But, it's not just replacing hardware for the sake of replacing hardware. It's to really bring that cloud experience to our computer source and more and more be able to consume it elastically as-a-service. And that's the unique value proposition we have, which is not only just the best infrastructure with ProLiant as a franchise, but the fact that we have a provisional life cycle management. And you should stay tuned for more announcement here shortly, but also be able to pivot that installed base to more a consumption base over time, and then more and more as a well to optimize solutions. And remember, these platforms come also in a different structure in the sense that you have more options and more technologies built into the platform. And so, for us, it's a big opportunity. And I think an accelerator of that transition is our GreenLake business. It's not just replacing the old infrastructure or the CapEx but be able to and repatriate workloads on-prem where it makes sense, or actually hold workloads on-prem because now we can deliver a true cloud experience in our consumption-driven model. And last but not least, let's not forget just the hardware is the operational services that come with it, because every upgrade cycle, whether it's the traditional way or as-a-service, obviously, as-a-service is even better because it comes with 100% attach of Pointnext OS. We have seen richer configurations and higher services attached. And that's why part of the gross margin expansion you saw in Q2, in compute, which was 550 basis points, comes also after the fact we are attaching more services to our infrastructure. Well, I will start and then Tarek will comment. Listen, we still have roughly a year to make the decision. The put expire in May 2022. Let me remind everybody that obviously China is the second largest IT market and growing. And our setup is unique, is unique in many ways to fulfill the needs of a unique market like China. And I think that joint venture with the partner has been incredibly successful driving shareholder values through H3C level and also through us, right, because obviously, we collect dividends from that joint venture. But it's a way to reach a market that's very hard to compete. So, we will continue to relate what is the best use of that capital in the context of participating in China, and we decided to take action what to do with our capital. But right now, we have not decided one way or the other one. We continue to explore what is the best return for shareholders and also to position the Company for growth as we think about the future. I don't know, Tarek, if you have any comments? Yes. No, thank you. Obviously, M&A is an important component of our strategy. And as we have done, at least I have done now probably 19 of them, has always has been about, obviously, very stringent return on invested capital, very disciplined in that approach. But it's always about bringing intellectual property and talent to accelerate our edge-to-cloud platform vision. Silver Peak was completed in September last year and now fully integrated into our business and now we start seeing the momentum in our Intelligent Edge business, and all the ones we are doing along the way, particularly around data and software-defined assets and so forth. So, again, we continue to evaluate what is available there, notwithstanding the fact that we have to be incredibly disciplined. As you know, valuation seems to be a little bit too high for some of the assets. But again, if there is something out there that makes sense, we will evaluate it, and we will take the right action. But again, it's an important component of our strategy going forward. And I always we talk about the Aruba-like type of things. But we evaluate everything, whatever is relevant for our strategy. I don't know, Tarek, if you have any comments on that. Sure. I will start, and Tarek will talk about the OI&E. I mean, obviously, if you look about the way we operate and the growth in IoT and the need for connectivity, obviously, is continuing to grow. Interesting enough, three years ago, I said that the enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And it's played exactly that way. Unfortunately, through the COVID pandemic, we saw that acceleration. But, when you think about digital transformation, right, obviously, we live in a digital economy. And the first step is to be connected. If you're not connected, you're not participating. That connectivity is not just any more users and devices as things -- everything is connected to the network, everything computes, everything generates data. And so, connectivity is at the forefront of the digital transformation. And obviously, remote working is requiring the need for Wi-Fi connectivity to a level we haven't seen before. But, that's an example of what's happening out there. But, I will say, our innovation with a true cloud-native platform at massive scale. And again, the fact that we already have 100,000 customers, and we're adding 150 customers every day, that tells you the value proposition resonated. We can provision a WAN port, a LAN port or a Wi-Fi port or a BLE or Zigbee, whatever is the amount protocol from the cloud. And we're able to do that in an intelligent and autonomous way. Because ultimately, it's about the data you collect and what experiences you can provide. And so, we believe this is absolutely durable. We are very bullish about this business. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits for the balance of the year. And as we add more functionality by cloud platform, particularly with edge computing and 5G, we are going to accelerate that momentum. And when you talk to customers and partners, they love the Aruba experience, absolutely love the simplicity, they love the fact that you improve their experience for their own business, and then powers this new way to work. So, that's why we are pretty excited. And the other thing is that the platform that Aruba runs the cloud is not the platform we run the rest of the Company. When we deploy now one of the data services through the new announcements we made on May 4th, or where we deploy compute or we deploy a workload-optimized is running on the same backend that Aruba was originally created. And that's why we have a true edge-to-cloud platform. And then, we lay on top of that the as-a-service model, whether it's subscription and software, which is growing triple digit in Aruba or whether it's the as-a-service model with GreenLake. And that's the unique differentiation we have in the marketplace. And that's why we feel very good about the growth prospect of this business. Tarek, on the OI&E? And I will say again, despite all of that, we have raised the guidance. Let me start. I'm going to talk more for the market. Tarek can talk more on the financial side. Listen, the bookings momentum is incredibly strong in this business. So, you have to look at the booking side and then you have to look at the revenue side. The bookings continue to be just amazing.

So, I would not think about the seasonality. I think about the long-term growth of the business, we feel pretty good and confident about that CAGR. But, even this year, we believe we're going to deliver the 8% to 12% growth just this year in 2021, right?

And then, this business is a lot of softer, right, that gets built around the system itself. So, that's why we're very bullish about this system and this business. And remember, it's all on the back of the day. That's why we talk about AI and deep learning technologies, data continue to grow exponentially, and you need more compute. That's a fact at the level you haven't seen before. Tarek, maybe you want to comment on the... And that growth will continue, which, as I said earlier, right, today, the HPC at the edge already represents 22% of the Company's revenue. And as we go forward with both businesses growing double digits, that 22% will be bigger at the different margin than the core, right? So, anyway, I know we are running out of time. Just to close, I'm very pleased with HPE's Q2 results that again, they are marked by strong revenue momentum, profitability and free cash flow. The overall demand is improving, but our execution, our innovation is perfectly timed to the customer needs that we see in the marketplace. And despite there is supply chain uncertainty around specific commodities, we factor all that in, in our ability to execute to the back half, and that's why we are raising once again for the third time in the year, our EPS and free cash flow. And I believe the future is edge-to-cloud, and it's going to be consumption-based. Well I think HP has a unique value proposition and set of offerings. And that's why I believe this is a very exciting time for HPE. We have worked really hard, despite the pandemic. Our team has been incredibly resilient. And this Company has a clear purpose to advance the way people live and work. And despite the challenges, we continue to support the communities we are in. So, again, thank you again for joining the call today. And I hope you continue to stay safe and healthy. And talk to you soon."

            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year \u201821. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on slide 1, and now, let me discuss our financial performance, starting with slide 2. I am very pleased to report that our Q2 results reflect continued momentum in revenue, strong gross and operating margin expansion, and robust cash flow generation. We delivered Q2 revenues of $6.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year period, a level better than our normal sequential seasonality. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin is at the record level of 34.3%, up 210 basis points from the prior year period and up 60 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher margin software-rich offering. Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased in the quarter, as we previously indicated, due to the planned hiring increases along with R&D and go-to-market investments. This offset by our continued progress delivering on the savings from our cost optimization plan, which is on track. Even with our investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 10.2%. That is up 300 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 59% year-over-year increase in operating profit. Within other income and expense, we benefited from onetime gains related to increased valuations in our Cohesity and IonQ investments within our Pathfinder venture portfolio. As a result, we now expect other income and expense for the full year in fiscal year \u201821 to be an expense of approximately $50 million. With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.46, up 70% from the prior year and meaningfully above the higher end of our outlook range for Q2. Q2 cash flow from operations was $822 million and free cash flow was $368 million, up $770 million from the prior year, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital benefits. This puts us at a record level of free cash flow for the first half at $931 million. Finally, we paid $156 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q3 dividend today of $0.12 per share, payable in July. Now, let's turn to our segment highlights on slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities to meet robust customer demand, delivering 17% year-over-year revenue growth across the portfolio. Switching was up 17% year-over-year, and wireless LAN was up 16%. Additionally, the Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year and now represent a meaningful contribution to HPE's overall ARR. We also continued to see strong operating margins at 15.5% in Q2, up 320 basis points year-over-year, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin expansion. Silver Peak continues to perform well, leveraging the high-growth SD-WAN market opportunity and contributed about 5 points to the Intelligent Edge top line growth. In HPC-MCS, revenue grew 11% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer acceptance milestones and deliver on our more than $2 billion of awarded contracts. We remain on track to deliver on our full year and three-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%. In compute, revenue grew 10% year-over-year and was down just 1% sequentially, reflecting much stronger than normal sequential seasonality. Operating margins were up meaningfully year-over-year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.3%, up 550 basis points from the prior year period and towards the upper range of our long-term margin guidance for these segments provided at SAM. Within storage, revenue grew 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. Nimble grew 17% with ongoing strong dHCI momentum growing triple digits. All-flash arrays grew 20% year-over-year, led by Primera that was up triple digits and is expected to surpass 3PAR sales next quarter. The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms and operational execution helped drive storage operating profit margin to 16.8%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the second consecutive quarter year-over-year as reported with further growth expected for the full year of fiscal year \u201821. This has been driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling product and service bundles, improved service intensity and our growing as-a-service business, which I'll remind you, involves service attach rates of 100%. This is very, very important to note because all of our OS revenue is recurring with three-year average contract length, and OS is the highest operating margin contributor to our segments. Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was down 3% year-over-year as the pandemic did not materially impact this business until later in 2020. As expected, we are seeing continued sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios ending this quarter at just 75 basis points, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. We have also seen improved cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. Our operating margin in this segment was 10.8%, up 160 basis points from the prior year and our return on equity at 18.3% is well above pre-pandemic levels and the 15%-plus target that we set at SAM. Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we are making great strides in our as-a-service offering with over 90 new enterprise GreenLake customers added. That is in Q2, bringing the total to well over 1,000. I am pleased to report that our Q2 \u201821 ARR was $678 million, which was up 30% year-over-year, as reported. Total as-a-service orders were up 41% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in North America and Central Europe. Our Edge-as-a-Service offerings also continued to grow revenue strong triple digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth targets of 30% to 40%, a CAGR from FY20 to FY23. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date where you can clearly see the strong rebound and momentum from our Q2 \u201820 trough. For the past two quarters, revenue has exceeded our normal sequential seasonality, reflecting the improving demand environment. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q2 by 70% year-over-year. Turning to slide 6. We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q2 of 34.3% of revenues, which was up 60 basis points sequentially and up 210 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, operational services margin expansion from cost takeout and automation, and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses, like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation storage offering. We have also benefited from the new segmentation we implemented beginning of fiscal year \u201820 that has given us much better visibility into each business unit and enabled better operational discipline. Moving to slide 7. You can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margin substantially from pandemic lows of -- to 10.2%, which is up 300 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. Q2 operating expenses also included planned increased hiring and spending on select investment to drive further growth. Turning to slide 8. We generated record first half levels of cash flow with $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and $931 million of free cash flow, which is up $1.5 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some in year timing-related benefits. I would like to underscore that this year, our free cash flow profile seasonality will be different as a result of our backend-loaded restructuring costs and investment in inventory for our supply chain to cater for rising demand and chip shortages as the economic recovery accelerates. Now, moving on to slide 9, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet. As of April 30th quarter end, we have improved the operating company to a net cash neutral position with our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we have made good progress securitizing some financial services-related debt through the ABS market and expect to have close to all of the U.S. portfolio securitized by year-end. The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at a cheaper cost of debt capital as well as diversifying and segregating our balance sheet between our operating company and our financial services business. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business, drive growth and execute on our strategy. Now, turning to our outlook on slide 10. I am very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in the demand environment and our strong operational performance to date. This will be our third guidance increase in SAM in October 2020. We now expect to grow non-GAAP operating profit by 25% to 35% and deliver fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.82 and $1.94. This is a $0.09 per share improvement at the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.88 and a $0.22 per share improvement at the midpoint since SAM. With respect to supply chain, we have executed well to date with minimal impact, and continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible. We do see further industry-wide tightening and inflation persisting in the near term, which has been factored in our outlook from both a revenue and cost perspective, but overall demand remains strong. From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in the first half. And while we continue to see further demand improvement, we remain prudent as certain geographies continue to navigate the pandemic, and we continue to observe uncertainties in the supply of commodity. More specifically for Q3 \u201821, we expect revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of up low single digits from Q2. For Q3 \u201821, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.04 to $0.10 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow in the first half and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising FY21 free cash flow guidance to $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. That is a $350 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance. So overall, Antonio and I are very proud of the progress we have made in the first half. We have navigated well through the pandemic and are exiting the first half with improved revenue momentum, strong profitability and robust cash flow. Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC-MCS have accelerated top line performance, our core business of compute and storage revenues are growing with improved margins, and our as-a-service ARR is accelerating. We also continue to execute well against our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which has made us leaner, better resourced and positioned to capitalize on the economic recovery currently at play. Now, with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you. Yes. Wamsi, hi. It's Tarek here. So, let me try and dissect the guidance we gave for Q3 and also the full year. So, putting things in perspective. First, you know we are raising our FY21 EPS outlook by $0.09 at the midpoint to $1.82 to $1.94 based on our Q2 outperformance. And we feel very confident for the rest of the year. This reflects what we see as continued improvement in customer spending, but also we want to remain prudent given the remaining pandemic and supply chain uncertainty. Specifically for Q3, it's important to note that we do expect revenue growth in line with normal FY18, FY19 sequential seasonality of up low single digits. We anchored you on FY18, FY19 and not last year because of the disruption we suffered in the supply chain last year. So, it's better to look at it from an FY18, FY19 viewpoint. You should expect that gross margins hold roughly flat relative to our H1 levels, near just under 34%. OpEx should be up somewhat as we continue to make select investments aligned to our strategy in key growth areas, and this is partially offset by further efficiencies we find. But most importantly, it is important that you note that OI&E will flip to an expense overall in the full year, and therefore, in the second half. OI&E in Q1 was a positive income and Q2 was a positive income. And now we're expecting for the full year \u201821 a $50 million expense, hence, the guidance that we're giving you overall for Q3. You can expect that the tax rate will be unchanged at 14%, like we said at SAM. And the net of all of this is that we expect our Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.44, and we feel pretty comfortable about it. Yes. Thank you, Katy. So, let me try and add a little bit more color to what we said already. So, first of all, remember, our cost optimization and allocation program. We exited FY20 very lean, and this has driven a very strong performance in Q1 at $0.52 per share. This is a level of earnings that was actually benefiting from the fact that we have a very strong run rate entering into Q1. In Q2, you saw that momentum continuing with the EPS that we posted at $0.46 per share. Very comfortable with the level of investments that we are making, and this is also showing in the gross and operating margin expansion that we've demonstrated so far. So, now, when you also look at how this translates into free cash flow, obviously, we had a lot of free cash flow benefits into Q1, Q2 as a result of the earnings strength and which translated into free cash flow. But moving forward, what you have to factor into the guidance on earnings is the fact that there is some degree of uncertainty on supply chain. Although, as Antonio said, the demand is very strong across the board. The demand is very strong in Aruba. The demand is very strong in Compute. And you can see that with units going up year-over-year. And also in HPC-MCS, we are seeing the revenue trending in the range that we guided at SAM. This is all good. Having said that, we have also to reckon two other dynamics. Aside from the cost optimization program and the demand, the other dynamic is OI&E, which affects EPS in Q3 and Q4. Q1, Q2, we had two income quarters as far as OI&E is concerned. They'll flip into an expense of $50 million for the full year, gives you an order of magnitude of what would be the EPS for each one of Q3, Q4. And then, on free cash flow, the other final element that drives it is we have to deal with supply chain, and we continue to buffer inventory to be ready for the demand in fiscal year \u201821 for the second half, but also fiscal year \u201822. We do not expect that the situation on inventory is going to be all of a sudden setting up across the world and across the industries, and we've taken steps, and we'll continue to do so. So overall, we're managing, I would say, the resurgent demand environment very well. We're lean from an organization standpoint. Our earnings power is shown by the margins we're posting. And also, you could see that what we're doing on free cash flow, we're doing very, very well. So hopefully, that gives you a color to your questions with the rankings of the various effects at play. And let me add to this, Kyle. There's also another aspect that we see the pent-up demand and really the need to modernize the infrastructure and the way the infrastructure is used. But also, if the decision to actually modernize the infrastructure and moving to consumption isn't made, it's not bad for us, because we benefit from extended leasing with our financial services portfolio, which has been doing extremely well with our asset management business as people tend to use the infrastructure more, absent a decision or an availability of supply for the equipment they want to use. So, it's good for us on all fronts. And we're very happy with that performance on both, the core compute business and HPFS. You said very well, Antonio. We have time to make the decision. The put expires in April 2022. So, we have a little bit less than a year, and that is to sell all or part of our 49% stake in units. We feel that this is a stake that continues to accreting value. Just to put things in perspective for everyone on the call, in fiscal year \u201820 alone, the equity interest contribution from H3C grew over 20% to $212 million for fiscal year \u201820. We expect that growth to continue, and therefore, the value of our stake to continue to accrete. Yes. Shannon, I mean, it's very important to maintain discipline and focus in the content -- in a context where valuations in some cases, particularly for some class of assets, a little bit exuberant. But, if we can find two to three Silver Peak type of acquisitions, I don't think Antonio and I will hesitate a second to just go and press the button. Yes. Thank you, Antonio. On the OI&E front, thanks for asking the question as to why we expect OI&E to flip into a negative in the second half. In OI&E, you have effectively three effects. The first one is the H3C economic contribution and the timing of which shifts between quarters, while like we said before, very happy with H3C and the economic interest that we have through them and the cash they return to us on a regular basis. So, it's a timing element there for H3C. There is also interest expense that is the second force in the OI&E line. And then, the third force is the Pathfinder portfolio, our venture portfolio, which has been doing extremely well in the first half, and we did flag this in my script. We said we had benefits from revaluations of our investment in Cohesity and IonQ. We had, in the first quarter in OI&E $16 million income in the second quarter, a $27 million income. This is on an aggregate basis across the three forces. So, for the first half, $43 million of OI&E income, and we're guiding for the full year for an expense of $50 million. So that's a $90 million swing. And that $90 million swing, if you turn it into an EPS number, divide that to do the math yourself, it's about $0.07 to $0.08 of EPS for the full year, right? That's the thing you have to reckon when you compute your Q3 or Q4 EPS forecast. That's the swing factor there. It does not change the fact that our operating performance remains very, very solid. The swing factor at the OI&E level is explaining a little bit more hopefully the guidance for all of you on the call. Yes. You said it very well, Antonio. We simply say, look, the order momentum remains very, very strong. It was up double digits in Q2. We have a large awarded order book with over $2 billion of contracts. The pipeline that we are having in mind includes another $5 billion of exascale opportunity to be awarded over the next three years. The win rates that we observe are very high. We win five out of six contracts in the exascale space. It's an inherently lumpy business. So, I think if you look at it on a quarterly basis, probably not the best picture. You have to look at it on a multiyear basis. And we feel very confident that we can achieve the 8% to 12% CAGR per year, including starting this year fiscal year \u201821. And because of the lumpiness of the revenue, you also have lumpiness in profitability as a result of the revenue profile and the product mix that doesn't worry us at all. It's the nature of the beast, so to speak. We feel that HPC-MCS is extremely well positioned as a business segment, to continue to be a very strong tractor of growth for HPE overall."

My name is Cole and I will be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call.  And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I am Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I would like to welcome you to our fiscal 2021 first quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Tarek Robbiati, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. It is hard to comprehend everything that has transpired around the world over the last year. The world we knew pre-pandemic has changed forever, and the need to use innovative technologies to advance the way people live and business operate has never been greater. Improving the health of our communities from educating our children to digitizing our economy and enable its recovery creates an enormous opportunity. I believe we are entering a new year, the age of insight, fueled by the amount of data around us. The arrival of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is a marvel of innovation and good news for us all, bringing hope and optimism for what lies ahead. I am personally very excited about the future of innovation and the impact it will have.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. I will start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year \u201821. As usual, I will be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 1 and now let me discuss our financial performance and KPIs, starting with Slide 2. I am delighted to report that our Q1 results were marked by continued momentum in revenue, substantial gross and operating margin expansion and robust cash generation. We delivered Q1 revenues of $6.8 billion, down 3% from the prior year period, but better than our typical historical sequential seasonality when normalizing for Q4 backlog. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin returned to above pre-pandemic levels and was up 30 basis points from the prior year period and up 300 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, the absence of backlog-related headwinds, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings. Our operating expenses decreased year-over-year, thanks to our ongoing structural efficiency measures as well as some timing-related benefits related to hiring in key selected areas, which have been pushed out. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3%, up 130 basis points from the prior year, which translates to an 11% year-over-year increase in operating profit. As a result of our strong execution, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, which was up 4% from the prior year and significantly above the higher end of our outlook range. Q1 cash flow from operations was close to $1 billion, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital timing benefits. Q1 free cash flow was $563 million, which was up approximately $750 million from the prior year and a record level for any first HPE first quarter. Finally, we paid $155 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in April 2021. Now let\u2019s turn to our segment highlights on Slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities, delivering 11% year-over-year growth, our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Switching was up 5% year-over-year with double-digit growth in North America. And wireless LAN was up 11% year-over-year with double-digit growth in both North America and APJ. Additionally, the Aruba SaaS offering was up triple digits year-over-year and is now a significant contributor to HPE overall ARR. Based on our solid performance, we expect to take share again this quarter in both campus switching and wireless LAN. We are also seeing the significant operating profit potential of this business with operating margins in Q1 of 18.9%, up 680 basis points year-over-year as we drove greater productivity from past investments and operational leverage benefits kick in. Finally, I am pleased to say we recognized our first full quarter of revenue from the acquisition of Silver Peak, the premium growth SD-WAN leader, which contributed approximately 500 basis points to the Intelligent Edge top line growth. In HPC and MCS, revenue declined 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the inherent lumpiness of the business, which is linked to the timing of deals and customer acceptance milestones. We remain very confident in the near-term and longer-term outlook for this business and are reaffirming our full year and 3-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%, respectively, as highlighted at SAM. We have an extremely strong order book of over $2 billion worth of awarded exascale contracts with another $5-plus billion of market opportunity over the next 3 years. Finally, we announced the launch of our HPC as-a-Service offer, which we expect to gain traction later this year and become a further contributor to our overall growing ARR profile. In Compute, revenue stabilized to a 2% year-over-year decline, but was up low single digits sequentially when normalizing for Q4 backlog, which attest of a strong order momentum in the quarter. Gross and operating margins were up meaningfully quarter-over-quarter due to the absence of any backlog-related margin impact, improved supply chain execution and the rightsizing of the cost structure of this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.5%, up 80 basis points from prior year period and at the high end of our long-term margin guidance for this segment provided at SAM. Within Storage, revenue declined 6% year-over-year, driven by difficult prior year compare, but with strong growth in software-defined offerings. We are extremely well positioned in Storage with Primera and Nimble dHCI. Our most software rich platforms, they are both growing triple digits year-over-year. They are absolute winners in the market, and Primera is on track to surpass 3PAR sales as early as next quarter. We also saw notable strength in overall Nimble, up 31% year-over-year, and total all-flash arrays were up 5% year-over-year. The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms helped drive storage operating profit margins to 19.7%, well above our long-term outlook for this segment presented at SAM last October. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue stabilized and was flat year-over-year, driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling products and services as bundles, improved services intensity and are growing as-a-service business, which I remind you, involves service attach rates of 100%. This is very important to note because all of our services \u2013 all of our OS revenue is recurring with 3-year average contract length, and OS remains the highest operating margin contributor to our segments. Within HPE Financial Services, revenue stabilized and was slightly down 1% year-over-year. As expected, we are seeing sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios, ending this quarter at approximately 0.9%, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. We have also seen strong cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 110 basis points on the prior year. And our return on equity is back to a pre-pandemic high-teens level of 16.5%. Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. Similar to last quarter, we are making great strides in our as-a-service offering this quarter with over 70 new GreenLake logos added in Q1. I am very pleased to report that our Q1 21 ARR came in at $649 million, representing 27% year-over-year reported growth. Total as-a-service orders were up 26% year-over-year, driven by very strong performance in Europe and Japan. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform also contributed to grow revenues strong triple digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving its ARR growth targets of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year \u201820 to fiscal year \u201823, which I am reiterating today. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from our Q2 trough. Revenue returned back to near pre-pandemic levels last quarter. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have nearly doubled EPS from the trough and are now growing year-over-year. Turning to Slide 6, we delivered a non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q1 of 33.7% of revenues, which was up 300 basis points sequentially and 30 basis points from the prior year period. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, the absence of backlog-related headwinds we had in the second half of last year, operational services, margin expansion from cost takeout and automation and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and Storage. Moving to Slide 7, you can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margins, which is up 280 basis points sequentially and 130 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits while simultaneously maintaining our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our innovation engine and revenue growth targets. Q1 operating expenses also benefited from delayed hiring and a push-out of select investments that we will be making to drive further growth. Turning to Slide 8, we generated record levels of first quarter cash flows. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1 billion, and free cash flow was $563 million for the quarter, up approximately $750 million from the prior year period. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some working capital in year timing related benefits. Now moving on to Slide 9, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet, liquidity position, which are a competitive advantage in the current environment. As of our January 31 quarter end, we had approximately $4.2 billion of cash on hand. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $9 billion of liquidity. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was recently reaffirmed by the rating agencies. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity to run our operations, continue to invest in our business to drive growth and execute on our strategy. Now turning to outlook on Slide 10, at our October 2020 Securities Analyst Meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year \u201821, which we raised by $0.03 at the midpoint to $1.60 to $1.78 in our last earnings release. Today, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we are raising our fiscal year guidance for fiscal year \u201821 once again to reflect our strong operational performance to date and confidence in our outlook. We now expect to grow our fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP operating profit by over 20% and expect to deliver fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.70 to $1.88, which is a $0.10 per share improvement on the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.60 to $1.78. From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in Q1. And whilst we continue to see gradual improvement, we remain prudent as we and the rest of the world continue to navigate the pandemic and related macro uncertainties. More specifically for Q2 \u201821, we expect revenue to be slightly better than in line with our normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q1. This still represents double-digit year-over-year growth from the $6 billion trough of Q2 of fiscal year \u201820. Now with respect to supply chain, I would like to remind everyone that we exited Q4 of fiscal year \u201820 with higher levels of inventory to protect against the risk of a short-term supply squeeze and address improved customer demand. With these actions and other proactive steps that we\u2019ve taken in Q1, we do not expect any meaningful impacts on our supply chain in the near-term. We are now turning our attention to working on strengthening our inventory supply for the second half of fiscal year \u201821 as we see improved levels of demand, recognizing also that we have entered an inflationary environment for memory components. For Q2 \u201821, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.02 to $0.08 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow this quarter and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year \u201821 free cash flow guidance from our SAM guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion to a revised outlook of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, a $250 million increase at the midpoint. So overall, Antonio and I are proud of these results. We have navigated well through unprecedented challenges in the last fiscal year and have started the new fiscal year strong out of the gate. We saw significant acceleration and customer demand in our Intelligent Edge business and the order pipeline in our HPC MCS business remains robust. Our core business of Compute and Storage revenues are stabilizing with improved margins, and our as-a-service ARR continues to show strong momentum aligned to our outlook. As a result of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we are emerging from an unprecedented crisis as a different company, one that is much leaner, better-resourced and positioned to capitalize on the gradual economic recovery currently at play. We are already seeing the benefits of our actions in our improved margin profile and free cash flow outlook. Now, with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Andy?\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks, Tarek. First question, please. Thank you.\nOperator: Certainly.  Our first question today will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. I\u2019m curious, everyone is talking about digital transformations, and they seem to have really gained traction early in COVID with the need for remote work. But now could you talk a bit about how customer priorities and purchase decisions are changing as we\u2019re moving past COVID? And I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s an opportunity for more consultative sales and higher ASPs margin. If you could talk about it maybe by segment, that would be helpful because I assume it may vary across your business lines? Thank you.\nAndrew Simanek: Thanks, Shannon. Yes.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thanks, Shannon. Yes. I will take that, Andy. Well, we definitely still see the tailwind of what we saw in 2020. Obviously, we work in a much more distributed environment. We talked about this all the time about the fact that many employees will never return to the office, and they need access to data and services in a very connected way. And so that\u2019s why we believe our Aruba business, it is a digital transformation engine for our customers. It is not just about access to a Wi-Fi port, but it\u2019s also the fact that provides that edge-to-cloud connectivity for all the apps and data, wherever they live. So what we see though is an acceleration for definitely the access to data, the analytics side. We see AI machine learning taking holding every segment of the market because data insights is necessary to compete in this new digital economy. We see, obviously, the need to improve IT resiliency based on the learnings we had in 2020. We see also the need to deploy cloud everywhere. And remember, our definition of the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And that\u2019s why we are very bullish about our HPE GreenLake cloud services. The pipeline, the size of the deal, the need to engage in a consultative application-driven conversation is increasing. And that\u2019s where we have aligned our advisory and professional services to that part of the business. So I think there is going to be a mix of things, Shannon. But ultimately, digital transformation is no longer a priority. It is a strategic imperative. And those who move fast around the data insights and digitizing everything will be the winners. No question.\nAndrew Simanek: Perfect. Great, thank you, Shannon. Operator, can we go to the question, please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi. Yes, thank you and congrats on the nice execution, and especially the strong cash flow performance. Antonio, you noted some solid order linearity. I was wondering if you can talk about any meaningful changes that you\u2019re seeing in your customer conversations around recovery and enterprise demand. And what are some of the key assumptions around the upside to the EPS and cash flow guide? Thank you. \nAntonio Neri: Well, maybe I\u2019ll start, and then I would like Tarek to talk about the EPS upside. Listen, I spent more than 50% of my time talking to customers and partners, and I see a renewed focus on making sure the businesses are positioned for success. Definitely, there is a need to modernize their infrastructure and deploy these new technologies across the board. Our order linear intake, Wamsi, it was very solid every single week of the quarter. There was no one week that was higher than others. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised about that. The way I manage the business with my team, a quarter has 13 weeks because when you go into a quarter, you already have a week of backlog and then you drive your linearity from there. And it was very consistent. It was across all businesses. As Tarek said, our Compute business saw sequential growth in our order intake, the same in our areas of the Storage portfolio, where we are pivoting, particularly everything that\u2019s software-defined. Aruba was very strong out of the gate, and we see the momentum going through 2021. GreenLake the same thing, but ultimately, their vision of edge-to-cloud is paying off because ultimately, customers need that architecture and a set of services that they can deliver what they need in this digital transformation. So we feel very confident about that. And that\u2019s why we are confident in raising the outlook, which Tarek gave you the insights about the EPS upside. So maybe, Tarek, you want to talk about that?\nTarek Robbiati: Sure, Antonio. Wamsi, thanks for the question. We feel very good about our guidance for the second quarter and the full year \u201821. We did express in our scripts that we see our non-GAAP operating profit growing by over 20% year-over-year, and our guidance reflect that. Now when you look at our margins for this quarter and the need to proceed with select investments, we feel that the guidance that we have on an EPS level is achievable, particularly when you look at the improvement quarter-over-quarter in Q2 and for the rest of the year, as Q3 and Q4 are usually strong quarters for our businesses such as the Intelligent Edge and also Storage. With respect to cash flow, our guidance has improved by $250 million at the midpoint, and it\u2019s a reflection of the improved outlook on operating profit. I am very pleased to put forward the guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in free cash flow and we will see as the year progresses, how this guidance will translate in actual results.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks, Wamsi. Can you go to the next question, please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question and also congrats on the quarter from me as well. I want to ask about the margin profile. Tarek, when you think about the performance that we\u2019ve seen this last quarter and you think about the mix of the business going forward, I guess, how do you think about the continued upward levers on gross margin? And can you just remind us of where we stand on the $800 million net savings initiatives from an OpEx perspective? Where we stand at now and what\u2019s left in terms of that target by the exit of fiscal \u201822? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Sure, Aaron. Thank you for the question. So let\u2019s pick up gross margin first, and then we\u2019ll talk about our cost optimization, resource allocation program. On gross margin, we feel very good that now that we\u2019ve put behind us all the effects from backlog in Q3, Q4 of last year. We\u2019re now operating the business in the context where we have normal business flows between orders and supply chain delivery. And we do acknowledge, like we said before, that there is an inflationary environment on some commodities such as DRAM. But we feel that we have the right levers around pricing and also purchases to navigate the upcoming quarters. We feel very good about our supply chain position in terms of inventory levels for the short-term. As a reminder, at the end of last year, we stocked up in anticipation of two things a resurgence in customer demand, which we saw happening; and also a potential squeeze in some commodities that we were anticipating back then, which is proving true now. But we are very well positioned to drive that. So we will navigate the short-term supply-demand equation reasonably well, pulling on pricing levers as needed in our core. In addition to this, you have a mix effect from software rich revenues. These are coming from storage and of course, the Intelligent Edge. Aruba is performing extremely well. It\u2019s a very high gross margin business. We see continued growth in Aruba. We\u2019ve demonstrated three quarters of consecutive growth. This is set to continue. The products are in very hot demand everywhere globally. And the mix effect will also play on the gross margin front. I think I\u2019ve given you sufficient color there. So maybe it\u2019s time we turn to the cost optimization and resource allocation program. The bottom line on this one is we\u2019re on track and the reason why you see our operating margins up to the levels that you\u2019ve seen north of 11% overall for the company is because of that program. And so what\u2019s very, very important for us is that we keep that expense discipline to sustain this level of operating profit growth moving forward and drive productivity, meaning having higher revenue over the same cost base to continue to drive operating profit growth and, therefore, translating into free cash flow growth moving forward. The $800 million net run rate benefits, as a reminder, would be felt for the most part in fiscal year \u201821. You started seeing some of that. We\u2019re incurring restructuring costs to that effect. And the program will be over by fiscal year \u201822. And we\u2019re well on track, and I\u2019m very pleased with how it\u2019s tracking as we speak.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: My other comment on the \u2013 sorry, Andy, my comment on what Tarek said, what we announced last year in Q2 was the right thing to do. It gave \u2013 we have enough experience in this company to tell us to take actions immediately and now proven to be very, very fruitful for us. As Tarek said in his remarks, right, we are becoming a different company, more leaner, more agile and allows us to prioritize investment in the areas of growth. So very pleased that we took that action at the time.\nAndrew Simanek: Yes, good point, Antonio. Thanks, Aaron, for the question. Operator, can we go to the next one please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. My congrats on the quarter as well. Question for Tarek, you beat the first quarter by about $0.11 versus consensus, you guided up the full year by $0.10. So the guidance implies that you don\u2019t operationally beat the next three quarters. Is that just prudence as we await full visibility into the pace of demand recovery? Or is that tied to some of the delayed OpEx investments that you mentioned? And maybe if you can detail what some of those investments are just so that we can understand what those are? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Sure. So, we pretty much, Katy, passed on to the full year guidance the entire beat in Q1. A couple of points on the investment front, you could see from some of the slides that we put forward, our investment in R&D and FSC, this has to continue, and we\u2019ll find adequate sources to fund investments in FSCs and R&D because we have to continue to fuel growth. And this is part of our story, which is to rethink our cost structure in terms of back-office and front-of-house to drive growth and innovation by way of software. So I feel pretty good about that. With respect to also your modeling of EPS on a full year basis, I want to take the opportunity to highlight what\u2019s going on at the OI&E level. OI&E was a positive contributor to EPS in this quarter. This is just simply due to timing, particularly the contribution of economic interest from HPC. For the full year, we still see overall in OI&E $100 million expense. And this is why you may think that the guidance is flat H1 on H2. But don\u2019t forget the effect of OI&E coming in, in the second half of the year as an expense.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks, Katy for the question. Can we go to the next one, please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. And I\u2019ll extend my congratulations as well. I wanted to talk a little bit on Aruba, fairly strong double-digit growth over here. And I think that\u2019s fairly impressive given peers like Cisco and Juniper are probably seeing low to mid single-digit growth. I know Silver Peak got some element to this. But I\u2019d love to get a sense from a share gain perspective, where are you seeing the share gains on the products and vertical side? Some color there would be helpful. And then the durability of this growth, that would be helpful to understand as well.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thanks, Amit. Well, listen, we believe Aruba is a winner, simply put. It is a software asset that delivers mobile-first class first experience that provides ubiquitous secure connectivity in a platform-oriented approach. So for us, it\u2019s not a surprise to see the momentum in that business, which is not just revenue as Tarek said three consecutive quarters of growth, but also five quarters of growth and margin expansion in that business. And as we commented early on, our SaaS revenue, which is the subscription to the platform is up three triple-digits, right, on that part of the business. We expect to gain both shares in campus switching and wireless LAN, whether is \u2013 we\u2019ll see how the market does. But some of our competitors don\u2019t disclose numbers. So it\u2019s hard to understand what was down versus up. But I think the market was not as positive as people portray, but we outperformed that market quite significantly. So whether it\u2019s 100 basis points, 200 basis points, all we see soon. But I\u2019ve remained very bullish. I remain very bullish about the business. This business will continue to grow for the balance of the year, also because now we have Silver Peak in our portfolio, which is a completely differentiated experience for the SD-WAN. And remember what I said early on, in an edge-to-cloud architecture, you have to connect all your edges and all your cloud. And the only way to do it at scale is through software. And Silver Peak brings a SaaS solution and also an on-prem solution that allows customers to connect all their edges on the cloud in a fully automated and autonomous way. And that\u2019s a big opportunity for us. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m really bullish because ultimately, we are integrating that solution into the same platform. And then there are multiple drivers of growth as we think about the next 12, 24, 36 months, which includes edge computing and 5G. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m very, very confident in our ability to deliver against that market.\nAndrew Simanek: Great, thank you. Thanks, Amit for the question. Can we go to the next one, please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you could help us understand where you see your market in terms of enterprises coming out of the pandemic or recovery? And really, the root of this question is Intelligent Edge looks like it\u2019s recovered with the year-over-year growth, whereas the other segments, maybe we can expect more of a recovery pattern later this year. So I\u2019m looking for maybe a bridge between what\u2019s execution and what\u2019s kind of macro recovery by segment. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. I mean, I think the market, in general, is recovering. As I said early on, Simon, is my point about the order linearity was steady and consistent throughout the quarter, which give us the confidence that we will see gradual continued improvement in that demand. And it\u2019s not one business. I think it\u2019s across all businesses. And I think it\u2019s a combination of our execution because of our strategy and the emphasis on the innovation that we bring to the market. And obviously, as the market gets better, we should take advantage of that, but remember, we have a unique value proposition. We are a company that has unique portfolio from edge-to-cloud. Our competitors don\u2019t have all of that. Some have in one area, some have in another area. And what customers want is an integrated experience more and more. And obviously, the shift to a consumption-driven model is in our favor because once we land a customer in GreenLake, basically, they get what they want, whether it\u2019s at the edge or what is in the core or whether it\u2019s in the managed services for the hybrid model that they are all adopting. So I think Compute, I think there are new technologies coming online with NVMe and more options that can be attached. Storage, obviously, is all the software-defined that Tarek talked about it. Data is exploding. And HPC, I\u2019m very bullish about HPC because ultimately, the data sets we see in customer sites continue to grow. And they all need AI machine learning at one point in time. Not just few customers. So whether it\u2019s large public sector, education also is going to be very good because we expect our children to get back to school at some point in time, obviously, transportation with autonomous vehicles and 5G deployments. So I see multiple growth going forward and obviously, it\u2019s in our hand to innovate and deliver against that opportunity.\nTarek Robbiati: Antonio, if I can add color to compute business, I think it\u2019s important we let everyone on the call know, that when you look at the underlying performance of compute and particularly when you normalize for Q4 backlog impacts, both AUP and units were up sequentially. So there is a real recovery in Compute if you strip out the impact of backlog in Q4. AUP was up high single digits, and units were up approximately 10% quarter-on-quarter once you do that normalization. It\u2019s very hard for analysts outside the company to do the normalization, but that\u2019s why I wanted to make the point. So hopefully, that will resonate with the analyst community on this earnings announcement.\nAndrew Simanek: Yes. Thanks, Tarek and thank you, Simon for the question. So we are just about at the top of the hour now. Operator, can we have the last questions, please?\nOperator: And our last question today will come from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPaul Coster: Not a very exciting question to finish up on, but it looks like you\u2019re pushing the upper boundary of your expected operating margin range for the core businesses. And I\u2019m wondering \u2013 and it sounds like they could get better yet. So are you going to change the range of expectations around operating margins or is this just sort of unsustainable what we\u2019re seeing at the moment?\nAntonio Neri: Tarek, you want to take that?\nTarek Robbiati: Yes, I will take it. Paul, this is a very exciting question. It\u2019s a very exciting question for me. It\u2019s essential. So don\u2019t be shy about it. I would simply say, look, we have to keep the expense discipline and drive productivity. We feel that the upper boundary has yet to be tested. And I would say that this is always, in a company like this, not a short-term endeavor, but something that has to be done on the sustainable business \u2013 on a sustainable basis moving forward. But remember also that what drives the operating margin is the continuous expansion into software. Margin risk software offerings and our ARR will start to shine as it continues to accelerate into fiscal year \u201821 and \u201822.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks, Paul, for the question. Antonio, maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to you for any final comments you have before we close the call.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thank you, Tarek, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I know there are more questions, but I know Tarek and the team will get off-line with you on the one-on-one follow-up calls. Now, I mean, I just want to reiterate this is a very solid start for our company for fiscal year \u201821. Obviously, we remain committed to driving shareholder value. I\u2019m particularly pleased with our results in profitability, in free cash flow, which was record-breaking. The fact that we are confident in the demand recovery and our own execution that allows us to raise guidance for the full year in both non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow, we see tremendous momentum in our areas of innovations and focus, Intelligent Edge and even HPC business, remember with our lumpiness of the business, confident to deliver that 8% to 12% growth and in the pivot to as-a-service. So because all of that, we believe this is going to be a good year in balance. And obviously, we\u2019re all watching the trends with the COVID. But I think customers realize that this is the year they need to make the investments to digitize everything in the company. So again, thank you for joining us today and I hope you continue to stay safe and healthy. Talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you. And at this time, you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. It is hard to comprehend everything that has transpired around the world over the last year. The world we knew pre-pandemic has changed forever, and the need to use innovative technologies to advance the way people live and business operate has never been greater. Improving the health of our communities from educating our children to digitizing our economy and enable its recovery creates an enormous opportunity. I believe we are entering a new year, the age of insight, fueled by the amount of data around us. The arrival of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is a marvel of innovation and good news for us all, bringing hope and optimism for what lies ahead. I am personally very excited about the future of innovation and the impact it will have. Well, thanks, Shannon. Yes. I will take that, Andy. Well, we definitely still see the tailwind of what we saw in 2020. Obviously, we work in a much more distributed environment. We talked about this all the time about the fact that many employees will never return to the office, and they need access to data and services in a very connected way. And so that's why we believe our Aruba business, it is a digital transformation engine for our customers. It is not just about access to a Wi-Fi port, but it's also the fact that provides that edge-to-cloud connectivity for all the apps and data, wherever they live. So what we see though is an acceleration for definitely the access to data, the analytics side. We see AI machine learning taking holding every segment of the market because data insights is necessary to compete in this new digital economy. We see, obviously, the need to improve IT resiliency based on the learnings we had in 2020. We see also the need to deploy cloud everywhere. And remember, our definition of the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And that's why we are very bullish about our HPE GreenLake cloud services. The pipeline, the size of the deal, the need to engage in a consultative application-driven conversation is increasing. And that's where we have aligned our advisory and professional services to that part of the business. So I think there is going to be a mix of things, Shannon. But ultimately, digital transformation is no longer a priority. It is a strategic imperative. And those who move fast around the data insights and digitizing everything will be the winners. No question. Well, maybe I'll start, and then I would like Tarek to talk about the EPS upside. Listen, I spent more than 50% of my time talking to customers and partners, and I see a renewed focus on making sure the businesses are positioned for success. Definitely, there is a need to modernize their infrastructure and deploy these new technologies across the board. Our order linear intake, Wamsi, it was very solid every single week of the quarter. There was no one week that was higher than others. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised about that. The way I manage the business with my team, a quarter has 13 weeks because when you go into a quarter, you already have a week of backlog and then you drive your linearity from there. And it was very consistent. It was across all businesses. As Tarek said, our Compute business saw sequential growth in our order intake, the same in our areas of the Storage portfolio, where we are pivoting, particularly everything that's software-defined. Aruba was very strong out of the gate, and we see the momentum going through 2021. GreenLake the same thing, but ultimately, their vision of edge-to-cloud is paying off because ultimately, customers need that architecture and a set of services that they can deliver what they need in this digital transformation. So we feel very confident about that. And that's why we are confident in raising the outlook, which Tarek gave you the insights about the EPS upside. So maybe, Tarek, you want to talk about that? My other comment on the \u2013 sorry, Andy, my comment on what Tarek said, what we announced last year in Q2 was the right thing to do. It gave \u2013 we have enough experience in this company to tell us to take actions immediately and now proven to be very, very fruitful for us. As Tarek said in his remarks, right, we are becoming a different company, more leaner, more agile and allows us to prioritize investment in the areas of growth. So very pleased that we took that action at the time. Well, thanks, Amit. Well, listen, we believe Aruba is a winner, simply put. It is a software asset that delivers mobile-first class first experience that provides ubiquitous secure connectivity in a platform-oriented approach. So for us, it's not a surprise to see the momentum in that business, which is not just revenue as Tarek said three consecutive quarters of growth, but also five quarters of growth and margin expansion in that business.

            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. I will start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year \u201821. As usual, I will be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 1 and now let me discuss our financial performance and KPIs, starting with Slide 2. I am delighted to report that our Q1 results were marked by continued momentum in revenue, substantial gross and operating margin expansion and robust cash generation. We delivered Q1 revenues of $6.8 billion, down 3% from the prior year period, but better than our typical historical sequential seasonality when normalizing for Q4 backlog. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin returned to above pre-pandemic levels and was up 30 basis points from the prior year period and up 300 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, the absence of backlog-related headwinds, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings. Our operating expenses decreased year-over-year, thanks to our ongoing structural efficiency measures as well as some timing-related benefits related to hiring in key selected areas, which have been pushed out. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3%, up 130 basis points from the prior year, which translates to an 11% year-over-year increase in operating profit. As a result of our strong execution, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, which was up 4% from the prior year and significantly above the higher end of our outlook range. Q1 cash flow from operations was close to $1 billion, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital timing benefits. Q1 free cash flow was $563 million, which was up approximately $750 million from the prior year and a record level for any first HPE first quarter. Finally, we paid $155 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in April 2021. Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities, delivering 11% year-over-year growth, our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Switching was up 5% year-over-year with double-digit growth in North America. And wireless LAN was up 11% year-over-year with double-digit growth in both North America and APJ. Additionally, the Aruba SaaS offering was up triple digits year-over-year and is now a significant contributor to HPE overall ARR. Based on our solid performance, we expect to take share again this quarter in both campus switching and wireless LAN. We are also seeing the significant operating profit potential of this business with operating margins in Q1 of 18.9%, up 680 basis points year-over-year as we drove greater productivity from past investments and operational leverage benefits kick in. Finally, I am pleased to say we recognized our first full quarter of revenue from the acquisition of Silver Peak, the premium growth SD-WAN leader, which contributed approximately 500 basis points to the Intelligent Edge top line growth. In HPC and MCS, revenue declined 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the inherent lumpiness of the business, which is linked to the timing of deals and customer acceptance milestones. We remain very confident in the near-term and longer-term outlook for this business and are reaffirming our full year and 3-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%, respectively, as highlighted at SAM. We have an extremely strong order book of over $2 billion worth of awarded exascale contracts with another $5-plus billion of market opportunity over the next 3 years. Finally, we announced the launch of our HPC as-a-Service offer, which we expect to gain traction later this year and become a further contributor to our overall growing ARR profile. In Compute, revenue stabilized to a 2% year-over-year decline, but was up low single digits sequentially when normalizing for Q4 backlog, which attest of a strong order momentum in the quarter. Gross and operating margins were up meaningfully quarter-over-quarter due to the absence of any backlog-related margin impact, improved supply chain execution and the rightsizing of the cost structure of this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.5%, up 80 basis points from prior year period and at the high end of our long-term margin guidance for this segment provided at SAM. Within Storage, revenue declined 6% year-over-year, driven by difficult prior year compare, but with strong growth in software-defined offerings. We are extremely well positioned in Storage with Primera and Nimble dHCI. Our most software rich platforms, they are both growing triple digits year-over-year. They are absolute winners in the market, and Primera is on track to surpass 3PAR sales as early as next quarter. We also saw notable strength in overall Nimble, up 31% year-over-year, and total all-flash arrays were up 5% year-over-year. The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms helped drive storage operating profit margins to 19.7%, well above our long-term outlook for this segment presented at SAM last October. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue stabilized and was flat year-over-year, driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling products and services as bundles, improved services intensity and are growing as-a-service business, which I remind you, involves service attach rates of 100%. This is very important to note because all of our services \u2013 all of our OS revenue is recurring with 3-year average contract length, and OS remains the highest operating margin contributor to our segments. Within HPE Financial Services, revenue stabilized and was slightly down 1% year-over-year. As expected, we are seeing sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios, ending this quarter at approximately 0.9%, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. We have also seen strong cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 110 basis points on the prior year. And our return on equity is back to a pre-pandemic high-teens level of 16.5%. Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. Similar to last quarter, we are making great strides in our as-a-service offering this quarter with over 70 new GreenLake logos added in Q1. I am very pleased to report that our Q1 21 ARR came in at $649 million, representing 27% year-over-year reported growth. Total as-a-service orders were up 26% year-over-year, driven by very strong performance in Europe and Japan. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform also contributed to grow revenues strong triple digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving its ARR growth targets of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year \u201820 to fiscal year \u201823, which I am reiterating today. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from our Q2 trough. Revenue returned back to near pre-pandemic levels last quarter. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have nearly doubled EPS from the trough and are now growing year-over-year. Turning to Slide 6, we delivered a non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q1 of 33.7% of revenues, which was up 300 basis points sequentially and 30 basis points from the prior year period. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, the absence of backlog-related headwinds we had in the second half of last year, operational services, margin expansion from cost takeout and automation and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and Storage. Moving to Slide 7, you can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margins, which is up 280 basis points sequentially and 130 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits while simultaneously maintaining our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our innovation engine and revenue growth targets. Q1 operating expenses also benefited from delayed hiring and a push-out of select investments that we will be making to drive further growth. Turning to Slide 8, we generated record levels of first quarter cash flows. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1 billion, and free cash flow was $563 million for the quarter, up approximately $750 million from the prior year period. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some working capital in year timing related benefits. Now moving on to Slide 9, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet, liquidity position, which are a competitive advantage in the current environment. As of our January 31 quarter end, we had approximately $4.2 billion of cash on hand. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $9 billion of liquidity. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was recently reaffirmed by the rating agencies. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity to run our operations, continue to invest in our business to drive growth and execute on our strategy. Now turning to outlook on Slide 10, at our October 2020 Securities Analyst Meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year \u201821, which we raised by $0.03 at the midpoint to $1.60 to $1.78 in our last earnings release. Today, I'm pleased to announce that we are raising our fiscal year guidance for fiscal year \u201821 once again to reflect our strong operational performance to date and confidence in our outlook. We now expect to grow our fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP operating profit by over 20% and expect to deliver fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.70 to $1.88, which is a $0.10 per share improvement on the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.60 to $1.78. From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in Q1. And whilst we continue to see gradual improvement, we remain prudent as we and the rest of the world continue to navigate the pandemic and related macro uncertainties. More specifically for Q2 \u201821, we expect revenue to be slightly better than in line with our normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q1. This still represents double-digit year-over-year growth from the $6 billion trough of Q2 of fiscal year \u201820. Now with respect to supply chain, I would like to remind everyone that we exited Q4 of fiscal year \u201820 with higher levels of inventory to protect against the risk of a short-term supply squeeze and address improved customer demand. With these actions and other proactive steps that we've taken in Q1, we do not expect any meaningful impacts on our supply chain in the near-term. We are now turning our attention to working on strengthening our inventory supply for the second half of fiscal year \u201821 as we see improved levels of demand, recognizing also that we have entered an inflationary environment for memory components. For Q2 \u201821, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.02 to $0.08 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow this quarter and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year \u201821 free cash flow guidance from our SAM guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion to a revised outlook of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, a $250 million increase at the midpoint. So overall, Antonio and I are proud of these results. We have navigated well through unprecedented challenges in the last fiscal year and have started the new fiscal year strong out of the gate. We saw significant acceleration and customer demand in our Intelligent Edge business and the order pipeline in our HPC MCS business remains robust. Our core business of Compute and Storage revenues are stabilizing with improved margins, and our as-a-service ARR continues to show strong momentum aligned to our outlook. As a result of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we are emerging from an unprecedented crisis as a different company, one that is much leaner, better-resourced and positioned to capitalize on the gradual economic recovery currently at play. We are already seeing the benefits of our actions in our improved margin profile and free cash flow outlook. Now, with that, let's open it up for questions. Andy? Sure, Antonio. Wamsi, thanks for the question. We feel very good about our guidance for the second quarter and the full year \u201821. We did express in our scripts that we see our non-GAAP operating profit growing by over 20% year-over-year, and our guidance reflect that. Now when you look at our margins for this quarter and the need to proceed with select investments, we feel that the guidance that we have on an EPS level is achievable, particularly when you look at the improvement quarter-over-quarter in Q2 and for the rest of the year, as Q3 and Q4 are usually strong quarters for our businesses such as the Intelligent Edge and also Storage. With respect to cash flow, our guidance has improved by $250 million at the midpoint, and it's a reflection of the improved outlook on operating profit. I am very pleased to put forward the guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in free cash flow and we will see as the year progresses, how this guidance will translate in actual results. Sure, Aaron. Thank you for the question. So let's pick up gross margin first, and then we'll talk about our cost optimization, resource allocation program. On gross margin, we feel very good that now that we've put behind us all the effects from backlog in Q3, Q4 of last year. We're now operating the business in the context where we have normal business flows between orders and supply chain delivery. And we do acknowledge, like we said before, that there is an inflationary environment on some commodities such as DRAM. But we feel that we have the right levers around pricing and also purchases to navigate the upcoming quarters. We feel very good about our supply chain position in terms of inventory levels for the short-term. As a reminder, at the end of last year, we stocked up in anticipation of two things a resurgence in customer demand, which we saw happening; and also a potential squeeze in some commodities that we were anticipating back then, which is proving true now. But we are very well positioned to drive that. So we will navigate the short-term supply-demand equation reasonably well, pulling on pricing levers as needed in our core. In addition to this, you have a mix effect from software rich revenues. These are coming from storage and of course, the Intelligent Edge. Aruba is performing extremely well. It's a very high gross margin business. We see continued growth in Aruba. We've demonstrated three quarters of consecutive growth. This is set to continue. The products are in very hot demand everywhere globally. And the mix effect will also play on the gross margin front. I think I've given you sufficient color there. So maybe it's time we turn to the cost optimization and resource allocation program. The bottom line on this one is we're on track and the reason why you see our operating margins up to the levels that you've seen north of 11% overall for the company is because of that program. And so what's very, very important for us is that we keep that expense discipline to sustain this level of operating profit growth moving forward and drive productivity, meaning having higher revenue over the same cost base to continue to drive operating profit growth and, therefore, translating into free cash flow growth moving forward. The $800 million net run rate benefits, as a reminder, would be felt for the most part in fiscal year \u201821. You started seeing some of that. We're incurring restructuring costs to that effect. And the program will be over by fiscal year \u201822. And we're well on track, and I'm very pleased with how it's tracking as we speak. Sure. So, we pretty much, Katy, passed on to the full year guidance the entire beat in Q1. A couple of points on the investment front, you could see from some of the slides that we put forward, our investment in R&D and FSC, this has to continue, and we'll find adequate sources to fund investments in FSCs and R&D because we have to continue to fuel growth. And this is part of our story, which is to rethink our cost structure in terms of back-office and front-of-house to drive growth and innovation by way of software. So I feel pretty good about that. With respect to also your modeling of EPS on a full year basis, I want to take the opportunity to highlight what's going on at the OI&E level. OI&E was a positive contributor to EPS in this quarter. This is just simply due to timing, particularly the contribution of economic interest from HPC. For the full year, we still see overall in OI&E $100 million expense. And this is why you may think that the guidance is flat H1 on H2. But don't forget the effect of OI&E coming in, in the second half of the year as an expense. Antonio, if I can add color to compute business, I think it's important we let everyone on the call know, that when you look at the underlying performance of compute and particularly when you normalize for Q4 backlog impacts, both AUP and units were up sequentially. So there is a real recovery in Compute if you strip out the impact of backlog in Q4. AUP was up high single digits, and units were up approximately 10% quarter-on-quarter once you do that normalization. It's very hard for analysts outside the company to do the normalization, but that's why I wanted to make the point. So hopefully, that will resonate with the analyst community on this earnings announcement. Yes, I will take it. Paul, this is a very exciting question. It's a very exciting question for me. It's essential. So don't be shy about it. I would simply say, look, we have to keep the expense discipline and drive productivity. We feel that the upper boundary has yet to be tested. And I would say that this is always, in a company like this, not a short-term endeavor, but something that has to be done on the sustainable business \u2013 on a sustainable basis moving forward. But remember also that what drives the operating margin is the continuous expansion into software. Margin risk software offerings and our ARR will start to shine as it continues to accelerate into fiscal year \u201821 and \u201822."

HPE had an impressive fourth quarter, delivering outstanding performance across our key performance metrics. Q4 was HPE's most profitable quarter on a non-GAAP continuing operations basis since 2017, with our second highest quarterly revenue and record quarterly free cash flow. In 2018, we introduced a clear strategy to deliver sustainable long-term value for shareholders. And in 2019, we began our pivot to prioritize recurring revenue through our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. We have refocused our portfolio and our customer value proposition to a high growth and higher gross margin solutions. We also improved our operating leverage across the Company. We are now seeing these strategic actions paying off. In Q4, orders remained steady, showing continued interest in our differentiated edge-to-cloud solutions across industries from enterprises, large and small. Demand over the course of the year was enduring and proved to be better than we anticipated. We closed this fiscal year with a significantly larger order book that we had at the start of the year. I am very proud of our performance in the quarter and in fiscal year 2022. Faced with ongoing macroeconomic challenges, supply constraints and adverse foreign exchange, HPE executed exceptionally well. During the fourth quarter, total HPE revenue climbed 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to almost $8 billion, which was above our sequential outlook as we started to see a slight improvement to ongoing supply constraints. Our Compute and Intelligent Edge businesses had particularly strong revenue growth, each rising more than 20%. Even on these higher revenue base, we grew our non-GAAP operating margin. Non-GAAP operating margin rose to 11.5%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, one of the highest quarterly levels in HPE's history. Non-GAAP gross margin was just above 33%, a 10 basis points improvement year-over-year, reflecting ongoing pricing discipline. As customers continue to turn to our edge-to-cloud solutions, we saw increased demand for our HPE GreenLake platform. Annualized revenue run rate rose 25% year-over-year even with supply constraints as a headwind. Total as-a-service orders again increased more than 30% from a year ago, helping us close the fiscal year with the as-a-service order growth of 68%. In the final quarter of the fiscal year as-a-service orders represented approximately 12% of the total company bookings. Non-GAAP profit in the quarter was a standout. We achieved record quarterly profit, despite the continued unfavorable effects from foreign exchange. Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.57, a 19% sequential rise and 10% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow in the final quarter was just shy of $2 billion, our best ever for a quarter. Free cash flow improved in the second half of the fiscal year 2022, as expected, following better supply chain conversion [Technical Difficulty] and working capital actions as we took to increase cash flow from operations. As we look at our full fiscal year '22 performance, it is clear the HPE GreenLake platform has enhanced our financial profile with more resilient, recurring revenue. Our portfolio is steadily becoming richer in software and services. We continue to shift our next to higher growth markets and more IP-rich offerings. And we continue to invest in our go-to-market capabilities that -- they are solution-led and outcome-based. Since we began our as-a-service pivot in 2019, our AIR has more than doubled to $963 million. We exited fiscal year 2022 with more than $8.3 billion in HPE GreenLake total contract value, more than twice what it was just two years ago. In fiscal year 2022, we produced $28.5 billion of revenue, 5% compared to 2021 and above the 3% to 4% outlook we provided at Securities Analysts Meeting 2021. We achieved this revenue despite not yet having booked all revenue from our Frontier exascale system, which was delayed because our customer needed to extend the acceptance timeframe. Through a combination of pricing actions, portfolio mix shift and cost discipline, we sustained our margins in fiscal year 2022, even in the face of supply constraints, and higher components and logistic costs. We increased our operating margin moving 210 basis points from about 8.5% two years ago to 10.6% for fiscal year 2022. Overall, in fiscal 2022, our operational performance resulted in a record non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $2.02, which came in above the midpoint of the guidance we gave at SAM 2022 in Houston last month, despite ongoing supply impacts, foreign exchange challenges and our exit from Russia and Belarus. We generated the second highest free cash flow in the fiscal year, a total of $1.8 billion, 3 times what it was in fiscal year 2020. We exited fiscal year 2022 with free cash flow at the midpoint of the target we guided at SAM 2022. Our fourth quarter and year-end results position us for continued, durable, profitable growth in fiscal year 2023, and we are confident in the guidance targets we gave last month at SAM. Going into next quarter, we are optimistic demand will sustain globally. It is clear that customers view their data first digital transformation critical to their success and are prioritizing hybrid cloud solutions to propel them forward, particularly in these dynamic times. As we look ahead for the next fiscal year, after many quarters of supply constraint in our market, we are beginning to see some improvements. Demand from the consumer sector is slowing, allowing some substrate capacity to shift to enterprise IT technologies. As a result, we have been able to reduce anticipated lead times for some products. We are continuing to take proactive measures to mitigate supply chain challenges and we are working through our large order book, which has experienced no material cancellations. Over the course of 2023, we expect to see greater easing but not an end to supply shortages. Despite supply constraints, the momentum we have generated with customers for our HPE GreenLake platform has been evident across our financial metrics. HPE GreenLake offers customers a unified and automated secure hybrid cloud experience, integrated across the edge data center colocations and public clouds. It is open, so customers can take advantage of the choice in architecture, but also benefit from the consistent cloud operating model HPE GreenLake provides for all workloads and applications across hybrid IT estates. With a true cloud metering capability, HPE GreenLake enables customers to flex capacity up and down, based on their business needs while benefiting from a wide range of cloud services to protect and analyze their data. Our market-leading differentiators helped us attract more new customers to our platform during the fourth quarter than any other quarter before, leading to twice as many new HPE GreenLake logos to end fiscal year 2022 than we had a year prior. Also, customers are consuming more HPE GreenLake services, increasing usage above their original contract commitments. Our partners are also seeing the relevance of HPE GreenLake with our customers. Partners booked more HPE GreenLake orders during the fourth quarter than they ever did before, extending their streak of orders growth to 22 consecutive quarters. During the fourth quarter, we also saw a greater share of partners booking multiple HPE GreenLake deals. Next week, we will meet face-to-face with several-thousand customers and partners at HPE Discover Frankfurt to discuss hybrid cloud transformation strategies, ways to drive value from the data across the edge-to-cloud, and how to bring the cloud experience to applications and data with HPE GreenLake. At the event, we will unveil important updates to our HPE GreenLake platform. One European customer who has recently adopted the HPE GreenLake platform is SPAR. SPAR is the supermarket you see everywhere in Europe from micro roadside convenience stores to massive one-stop hypermarkets. SPAR has decided to build its own hybrid cloud on HPE GreenLake to run the Company's core business. Our platform is running all major applications of SPAR's innovation engine as the retailer pursues its ambition to create the future of grocery and retail shopping. The HPE GreenLake platform also helps SPAR use data to make strategic decisions on everything from warehousing and logistics to in-store experiences to advance its business. HPE GreenLake is playing an increasingly important role in customers' IT strategies and in addressing all their needs with one unified edge-to-cloud experience. This fiscal year, we performed remarkably well for our customers, our shareholders and our HPE team members. We helped our customers use technology to accelerate the business outcomes while navigating in dynamic environment. Our expanding market leadership demonstrates the trust that customers place in us and the value defined in the differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio that only we can deliver. Demand for our HPE solution has been enduring throughout 2022 and continue to be steady as we move into fiscal year 2023. For our shareholders, by executing our strategy, we have pivoted HPE to a richer mix of software and services that is delivering recurring profitable growth. In fiscal year 2022, we posted strong revenue growth, record-breaking non-GAAP earnings per share and outstanding free cash flow. I am so proud of our team members around the world who have made these results and our transformation possible through their ingenuity and engagement. In fact, this year, HPE achieved one of the highest employee engagement scores in the history of our company, up 20 points over the last five years. Our culture has attracted some of the brightest, most innovative talent in tech. HPE's team members are bringing their energy and ideas to write HPE's next chapter and cement us as the edge-to-cloud market leader. With our team engaged, our strategy taking flight and our market-leading solutions playing critical roles in customers' business, we enter fiscal year 2023 with incredible momentum on all fronts. And I look forward to advancing our strategy and leadership even further in the next year. And with that, I would like now to pass it over to Tarek to make his comments and provide a little bit more details about our financial performance. So, Tarek, over to you.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. Q4 was, no question, an outstanding quarter for HPE. As usual, I will reference slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q4 '22 and fiscal year '22 on slides 4 and 5. Let me discuss our Q4 performance details, starting with slide 6. Sustained demand continues to be a core attribute of our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio, which is translated to record or near-record results. As expected, year-over-year order growth continued to moderate in Q4 '22 to down 16% year-over-year as we lap challenging compares. Having said that, our sequential order growth was flat relative to Q3 '22, which illustrates that demand for our products and services is steady. The key takeaway here is that we are entering fiscal year '23 with an order book that is even higher than the order book we entered fiscal year '22 with, which attests to our momentum for fiscal year 2023. Now that we have closed fiscal year '22, we will again turn our attention to focus on revenues rather than orders as we have been flagging. This is because of timing differences, orders and backlog are not traditionally good indicators of quarterly revenue in normal times. We will continue to disclose orders for our as-a-service and HPE Pointnext OS business. While the supply environment is improving, it is not quite back to pre-pandemic levels. Our large order book contributes to our confidence in our fiscal year '23 revenue outlook of 2% to 4% growth adjusted for currency, and the longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the fiscal year '22 to '25 period we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting in Houston last October. We delivered Q4 revenue of $7.9 billion, which is up 12% annually and 15% sequentially adjusted for currency. This is the second highest revenue figure since our separation transactions in 2017. It would easily have been the highest had revenue recognition from the Frontier deal not slipped into fiscal year '23. The Q4 sequential revenue growth is well above our prior outlook for at least 5% sequential growth. We have had healthy demand throughout the past two years. We now also have improving supply as supply capacity in the consumer electronics markets is redirected towards enterprise markets where demand for digital transformation continues unabated. We closed fiscal year '22 with full year revenue growth of 3% as reported. Currency and our exit from Russia and Belarus represented a 300 basis points headwind to revenue for the full year, which means we ended the year solidly above our initial guidance for 3% to 4% revenue growth adjusted for currency. Our non-GAAP gross margins remain resilient, thanks to the pricing actions we have taken. Our 33.1% non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 is up 10 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a very strong Compute quarter and higher logistics costs in the Edge business. We retain our pricing discipline and continue to shift our mix of business towards higher-margin, software-intensive as-a-service offerings. Non-GAAP operating margins reached a record 11.5%, which represented a 100 basis points increase sequentially and a 180 basis points increase year-over-year. This result would not have been possible without the strategic actions we have taken back in fiscal year '20 to reallocate resources and optimize our cost structure. These actions have put us in the position to benefit from an enhanced operating leverage for several quarters over the past three years, and this will continue in fiscal year '23 and beyond as Antonio and I remain determined to maintain our focus on productivity. Our cost optimization and resource allocation program announced during the pandemic of 2020 and which is now substantially finished, has achieved annual savings of $875 million, well above our initial target of $800 million. As a result, we are now rightsized and we are entering a very different phase of the Company, one where the combination of our enhanced cost structure and substantial order book is expected to deliver profitable growth that is increasingly recurring at higher margins as our as-a-service transformation continues to unfold. Thanks to revenue growth above our guidance, we delivered Q4 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.57, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. This is the highest quarterly non-GAAP net diluted EPS figure since our 2017 separations. Our full year non-GAAP net diluted EPS of $2.02 was at the upper end of our guidance range of $1.96 to $2.04 post Russia and FX and near the midpoint of our SAM 2021 guidance. Again, we estimate FX impacts and our Russia exit combined for a $0.17 EPS headwind in fiscal year '22. Our GAAP P&L reflects a noncash write-down of goodwill in our HPC, AI and software businesses. Macro trends, including contracting market multiples and higher discount rates used in our impairment test for HPC, AI and software, respectively, significantly impacted this outcome. We continue, nonetheless, to be bullish on the HPC, AI segment given our clear number one position in the market, and our outlook for this segment is consistent with what we said at SAM 2022, and software remains a critical component of our HPE GreenLake strategy. I am particularly pleased with our free cash flow performance in Q4 '22, where we generated $3 billion in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $2 billion as we work through our substantial orders and reduce our inventory. As Antonio mentioned, this brought our full year free cash flow to $1.8 billion. This is triple our free cash flow in 2020. For the year, free cash flow met the midpoint of our guidance. In fact, our full year free cash flow met our initial pre-Russia and FX guidance from SAM 2021. Finally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We returned over $1.1 billion in capital to shareholders this year, which represents over 60% of our free cash flow. We paid $154 million in dividends this quarter and repurchased $128 million in stock. That brought our buyback plan to $512 million for the year, above our $500 million target. Our as-a-Service business momentum remains strong and this business is lifting our mix of higher margin recurring revenue. Total as-a-service orders remain robust. Orders grew 33% in Q4 despite lapping 104% growth in Q4 '21. On a constant currency basis, orders grew 43% in Q4 and our full year as-a-service orders grew 68%. This indicates the long-term health of our as-a-service portfolio and further strengthens our confidence in our three-year ARR target of a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year '22 to fiscal year '25. Our ARR of $936 million represented 17% growth as reported and 25% growth in constant currency. For much of fiscal year '22, the industry supply constraints have limited shipments and weighed on our growth rate. We expect the improved supply environment to accelerate our ARR growth moving forward. We also continue to expand our as-a-service\u2019s margin as our mix of software and services increased to 66% in Q4, up 4 points year-over-year, thanks to our cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in Edge and Storage. As a result, the gross margins in our as-a-service business remain meaningfully above our corporate gross margins. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. All revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we delivered a record quarterly revenue number. We grew our revenues 23% year-over-year. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share across wireless LAN, enterprise switching and SD-WAN including in some of the largest enterprise customers. Customers are increasingly adopting our Edge services platform and automation software suite. Our operating margin of 13.3% was up 2.4% annually, though down 3.2% sequentially with FX being the biggest contributor to the sequential decline. We continue to expect our Edge business to grow and perform like a Rule of 40 business moving forward. In HPC & AI, revenue fell 11% year-over-year, solely as a result of the Frontier deal slipping into fiscal year '23, which also impacted our operating margin in this segment. We are on track to close that deal in Q1 and have factored that into our guidance. We continue to have orders for HPC & AI solutions of about $3 billion to be delivered in upcoming quarters. Compute revenues grew 22% year-over-year to a near record of $3.7 billion. The segment benefited from the multi-sourcing and demand steering initiatives we have discussed in prior calls, as well as steadily improving supply availability. We have clearly outperformed the competition in fiscal year '22 and our dynamic pricing strategy has helped us navigate a volatile supply climate while maintaining a healthy margin profile. Our Compute operating margin of 14.7% remains well above our long-term outlook for 11% to 13%, which attest of the best-in-class performance delivered by our Compute business. In Storage, we are very pleased to report 6% revenue growth led by all-flash array and HCI. Alletra is one of our fastest ramping new products ever and grew revenue 100% sequentially. In total, revenue from our own IP, margin-rich products rose strong double digits in Q4 and contributed to an annual operating margin of 15.9%, which represents a year-over-year gain of 210 basis points and a sequential gain of 120 basis points. Our storage transformation is now in full swing, as you can see. And we expect our storage business to deliver revenue growth in line with market with our own IP products growing above market. With respect to Pointnext operational services, combined with storage services, orders grew sequentially and for the year rose mid-single digits in constant currency despite the exit of our Russia and Belarus business. Finally, HPE Financial Services expanded its financial volume 3% year-over-year, and revenue rose 6%. Our operating margins fell 3 percentage points year-over-year as we adjust our prices for a higher interest rate climate. It is worth reiterating that our leasing profit dollars are well insulated from a higher rate environment over time as we price on a spread and that our business is resilient in a downturn. Throughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our loss ratio is currently nearing pre-pandemic levels of approximately 0.5%. As a result, our fiscal year '22 HPEFS return on equity remained well above the 18% target we reiterated at SAM 2022. Slide 9 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP net diluted EPS performance. Antonio and I are very pleased that our strategic focus on both the top and bottom lines is evident in these results. Our revenue and EPS continue to grow despite the volatile supply environment, the exit from our Russia and Belarus businesses and increasing headwinds from currency. As mentioned earlier, during fiscal year '22, we experienced a headwind of $0.12 from currency and $0.05 from exiting Russia and Belarus. In spite of these headwinds, we met our SAM '21 non-GAAP guidance for fiscal year '22 and delivered a better mix of higher-margin earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our Edge-to-Cloud strategy. This improvement can be seen on slide 10, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q4 of 33.1%. This is a 10 basis points year-over-year improvement despite a significant revenue mix shift to Compute this quarter. Our growing gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of our strategic pricing actions through the supply challenges and the favorable mix shift we are driving towards higher-margin products across our portfolio. Moving to slide 11, you can observe that we have delivered an 11.5% non-GAAP operating margin for the Company. This is not only up 180 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially, but it is the highest operating margin in the history of the Company since our 2017 separations. Our very strong Q4 revenue performance and our resilient gross margins are certainly leading contributors to the operating margin expansion. And again, as I mentioned at SAM, this performance would not have been possible without the foundation provided by our resource allocation and cost optimization plan that we launched at the start of the 2020 pandemic. On slide 12, let's discuss our setup in China through H3C. As disclosed at SAM, we have extended our existing put option that is struck at 15 time trailing 12-month earnings through to December 31, 2022. We did this to allow our partners time to finalize their engagement with their stakeholders and make our final decision regarding our stake in H3C. Through our commercial contracts and equity interest, H3C has contributed a substantial amount to our EPS and free cash flow and our shareholder value in fiscal year '22. We will balance the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk. We will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer-term solution for this asset. Our cash flow story on slide 13, a test of our outstanding execution. Our Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $3 billion and $2 billion, respectively. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality and our expectations of working capital tailwinds in the second half. We have been strategically building inventory ahead of the competition throughout fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '22 to navigate the supply chain environment. Our inventory balances have now peaked and are beginning to decline as we enter fiscal year '23 and deliver on our substantial order book. Our strong Q4 cash flow brought full year '22 cash flow from operations to $4.6 billion and our free cash flow to $1.8 billion. The $1.8 billion is triple what we delivered in fiscal year '20. It is also at the midpoint of our guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, despite the negative impact of Russia and FX that we estimate to be approximately $250 million. Now turning to our outlook on slide 14. As we discussed, demand for our products and services portfolio remained steady in Q4 relative to Q3. Our view remains one of enduring market demand given the mega trends of digital transformation and the explosion of data. We also believe our own portfolio differentiation will allow market share gains. Let me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure and FX risk. I would like to remind all of you that approximately 55% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies. For Q1 '23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a mid-single-digit seasonal decline that we typically experience in Q1 relative to Q4 of each year. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.32 to $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.50 to $0.58. While we are pleased with our Q1 outlook, we are cognizant given the macroeconomic environment and FX headwinds that it is too early at this stage to rethink our fiscal year '23 guidance. Given the points above, we consider it prudent to assume our year may be more weighted to the first half than is typical. We are, therefore, reiterating our full year '23 guidance. This includes revenue growth of 2% to 4% adjusted for currency, non-GAAP operating profit growth of 4% to 5%, GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.38 to $1.46, non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.96 to $2.04, and free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. In terms of capital returns, we are maintaining our dividends and expect to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year '23, just like we did in fiscal year '22. So to conclude, our results speak for themselves and a test of our outstanding execution in a quarter that can be characterized by enduring demand for our differentiated portfolio of products and services. We look forward to continuing our execution momentum in fiscal year '23. Now with that, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. And congrats on good results. I was wondering if you can comment a little bit about what the demand trends look like by region? It seems like a lot of companies are citing more of a slowdown, like NetApp just now and Dell last week. I'm curious to get your thoughts on how IT budgets are shaping up for calendar '23? Most companies we're speaking with are more cautious about the near term, maybe the first half of '23 and optimistic more of a recovery in '23. And I think, Tarek, you just said that for you, you're expecting, if I heard that right, like more confidence in sort of the first half. So, any color there would be helpful. Thank you so much.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. As we said in our commentary, we exited 2022 with a significant larger book than we entered 2022. And that demand was enduring, honestly, was better than we anticipated and remains steady, because when you look at the quarter-over-quarter, Tarek mentioned, was flat. But I think we have a point of differentiation compared to others. I think it's important to recognize. First, we have a diversity of portfolio from edge-to-cloud. And you can see some of the results in the Edge, which obviously are outstanding. I think our HPE GreenLake is unique because it delivers a true hybrid experience that you can consume as-a-service, and that's also dragging the entire portfolio. And when I talk about customers, what we see, customers continue to prioritize digital transformations. And a lot of that is driven by the need to automate, simplify, be more efficient in everything they do and also prioritize that data. The data insights to me, are an important aspect of what customers are looking for. And so, I think demand is there. I think in our case, probably it\u2019s better balanced. You asked a question about the geos. I think the performance of the geo has been even, I mean, even across all the 10 geos that we have, and across the segments. I got this question early on, if this is just an enterprise or a small business? No, it is the 10 geos and all the segments from large to small, medium business. In terms of budget, just a month or so ago, we hosted what we call the Board of Advisory, and we have 25 customers that represent multiple industries. And the sentiment there is that they need to continue to digitize and they need to continue to ensure technology plays a vital role. And again, these are technologies in the edge, connectivity being one important aspect. The other one is obviously cloud, but cloud as an experience, not just putting data in one place is a true hybrid approach. And then these data, data-driven insights. And so we are, I think, very uniquely positioned to capture that opportunity.\nOperator: The next question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKyle McNealy: This one is for the Compute business. We assume a big part of it was driven by the supply improvement that you talked about, but units were only up 4% year-over-year. So, there may not have been an incredible amount of backlog consumption. So, can we talk a bit more about the AUPs? They're still growing at about teens year-over-year. It was high-teens this quarter based on the pace of your price increases and the momentum of richer configs that you called out. How long do you think that this growth will continue? And what does the durability of the AUP trajectory look like for you guys?\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. Kyle, thanks. I think you understand the trends in our Compute business really well. So, let me reiterate. We ended the year with record quarterly revenues of $3.7 billion. This is a 22% year-over-year growth at constant currency. Unit growth was 4% and AUP was an increase in the high-teens as you foreshadowed. And what's driving the demand for our Compute solutions is richer configs. Customers of all sizes are selecting our Compute solutions to run their private clouds and to power multitude of workloads, data types and applications. And Compute remains and will continue to remain a critical component of our customer transition towards modern edge-to-cloud architectures. And you're right in saying that with these results and the unit increase, our order book in Compute remains strong as we enter fiscal year '23. So, moving forward, trend-wise, what you can expect is, obviously, this level of AUP growth to come down as we'll have to pass on to our customers the benefit of ease -- pricing of commodity easing, but we feel very good about the prospects of Compute in fiscal year '23, given the order book, the fact that our products are more and more differentiated and the need for customers to continue to opt for greater configs.\nAntonio Neri: And I will say, Kyle, we just introduced the Gen11 platform. And one of the key differentiation we have -- actually, we have several -- number one is our hybrid design. It was designed with hybrid in mind, meaning the solution gets deployed and managed from HPE GreenLake, whatever you deploy that. Number 2 is continued enhancement on the security side, which is a point of differentiation. And one that really is coming up is sustainability. In our new offer, we actually provide customers with ability to optimize the Compute platform based on carbon footprint and consumption, and we get them also a carbon footprint report. So that allowed them to maximize the usage of the platform while they reduce that carbon footprint. So overall, we continue to see good momentum, and we are bringing new innovation into the platform itself.\nOperator: The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: I wanted to dig a little bit more into your as-a-service business. Just looking at the like absolute dollars. You had a stair step up to $936 million annualized run rate during the quarter. And it looks like there was a significant uptick in the percent -- well, at least 200 basis uptick in the percent of revenue coming from software services. So, I'm wondering what's behind that and what trends you're seeing as you sign more and more of these contracts with your customers on a ratable basis? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thank you, Shannon. I think a couple of things. So first of all, we ended the year with a 68% year-over-year growth in our bookings. Today, we have now $8.3 billion in total contract value. As you know, those are contracts -- can vary between 3 to 5 years. So, as you can imagine, that gives us a tremendous confidence that we will grow that ARR in the 35% to 45%. We actually closed 2022 with twice as many new HPE logos that we entered now into the 2022 year. And then the important fact is why the mix is shifting is because the Aruba business is all a subscription business. And Tarek made a comment about the automation suite, obviously, software-defined wide area network, and also the subscription to wireless or switching comes through the platform, but also the growth that we've seen in storage. Storage had a great quarter, particularly on our own IP product. That's all software defined, and that's all subscription-based. And what excites Tarek and me is the fact that in 2023, you're going to see an acceleration of that portfolio to HPE Alletra, which -- HPE Alletra had 100% growth sequential. And obviously, that comes also with an incredible attach of Pointnext OS. And also, as we drive that data protection strategy, the incremental value comes from backup and recovery and disaster recovery and ransomware offers. We have now those offers integrated into HPE GreenLake. And so that combination is what's driving the mix shift to more software and services rich offers.\nOperator: The next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: I wanted to see if we could dig into what you're seeing in terms of trends for the Compute business. In particular, what's catching my attention is after this very, very strong result for the quarter, it sounds like you're confident in the outlook. And that stands in contrast to your biggest competitor in servers, which seems to be expecting a decline in calendar '23. So, if you could maybe do a little bit of compare and contrast as to why you might be seeing the world differently than they are if I'm interpreting your outlook correctly?\nTarek Robbiati: Okay. Sure, Simon. So I would say, if you refer to our prime competitor, I think some of their comments are referring to the consumer side of their operation as much as referred to their enterprise side.\nSimon Leopold: Yes. I'm specifically looking at servers and Compute. So...\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. I think overall, so when you look at their results, they were, I would say, not too bad, we did much better than they did. And that is a function of many steps that we have taken in Compute. So there is Gen11 being one of our key solutions now are gaining traction in the market as customers need bigger and richer configs moving forward. Our customers knew that Gen11 was coming and they held their orders firm. So, we had no orders cancellations that are meaningful throughout fiscal year '22. And we finally got the supply that was there to be able to bring our customers to the next-generation compute environment. So, we feel very good about where we are. And to the extent that supply is there, we have a contrasting view relative to our -- what our competitors are signaling with respect to their service business.\nAntonio Neri: So I will add, Simon, that the demand has been enduring and steady throughout the years -- throughout the four quarters in 2022. We exit the year with a significant larger order book. When I think about our differentiation, I think our Compute is differentiated because of HPE GreenLake. It's because of the experience we provide to our Compute platform. And the fact also, if you recall, two years ago, we said we are diversifying our go-to-market as well to attack profitable growth in segments where we did not participated as much, particularly more in the commercial to mid-market space. And one of the areas we saw great growth was through our channel ecosystem. And then, you couple all of that with our pricing discipline and then you get the results of unit growth and revenue growth with amazing profitability. So, I think we have that tailwind. What Tarek covered is all about the revenue side. But on the demand side, it comes to those factors. And I think Gen11 is another step in that direction, which actually gives us tremendous differentiation.\nOperator: The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Congrats on the strong results here. I guess I just wanted to see if you could talk about backlog or the order book in context of the segments of it and how to think about the supply improvement, particularly if you can shed some color on where backlog or order book remains most elevated related to sort of normal exiting the year and as supply improves next year as you outlined, where can we see the most likelihood of sort of digesting that backlog down to a bit more closer to normal levels? And it seems like you're expecting supply to remain sort of a constraint. So, backlog probably doesn't come back to normal by the end of next year, but any thoughts on that also would be appreciated. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Well, as Tarek said in his comments, going forward, we're going to move away from all of these backlog orders and the like to focus on the revenue. That's why we gave the revenue guidance in Q1 because I think it's a better indicator of what we're going to see. I will say, in Q4, what we were able to incrementally convert from the backlog was mid-single-digits, or order book, as we call it now, is very, very large. And in fact, in such segments, particularly in the Edge business, the order book is now bigger at the end of Q4 than it was at the end of Q3. So, the bottom line is that we see that enduring steady demand and we'll take up the entire 2023. And honestly, I'm not sure we will ever exit 2023 to back to historical level. I don't think that will be the case. Because as good as we are trying to convert some incremental aspects of the order book as we go forward to some easing of the supply, the demand continues to be there. So, I think it's going to take a little bit of time. And I think that the order book will return to normal, I would say, historical level, once the incremental capacity comes on line. Because when we saw in this particular quarter some easing, it was because some reallocation of substrate came at the expense of the consumer business, which obviously is down but the incremental capacity is not yet on line, particularly in those older technology nodes, call it, 28, 40 and 65 nanometers, which is where the constraint is.\nOperator: The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: Your guidance for Q1 implies double-digit revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. For the full year, you're at 2% to 4%. So, is what you're seeing in Q1 really a reflection of confidence in backlog drawdown, or are you implicitly seeing demand slow over the course of the year? And then related to that, your free cash flow guidance is well below your net income for fiscal '23, despite the fact that you believe you can dry down the inventory further. Maybe you can help us with the bridge there. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Toni. Let me start, and I will give it to Tarek. As we said, we gave the revenue guidance $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion. I'm not sure it's double digit, but maybe high single digit compared to Q1 2022. But in any case, that guidance includes the recognition of the remaining part of Frontier, which obviously is an important aspect of the HPC. And then the ongoing ability to convert the order book as it comes in, plus the larger order book we already have. And then maintaining a certain level of margin, obviously, which we are confident based on our pricing and operating leverage actions we have taken. So, that's where we stand, and that's where we gave the guidance. As we go through the quarter -- through the year, sorry, we felt prudent at this point in time to maintain it because of the FX uncertainty. Obviously, FX stabilizes or slightly improve, that full year guidance implies there is some potential upside. But also, it's going to come down to the supply availability, as I just made the comments early on. In terms of the free cash flow and the working capital, I will pass it to Tarek.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. Well, thank you, Antonio, and thank you, Toni. So, our free cash flow for fiscal year '23 is going to be driven, obviously, by our earnings, but also reduction in restructuring expense, and you will observe already between '21 and '22 when you have a chance to look at our 8-K filing that restructuring expense is dropping quite considerably. And that trend will continue in FY23 relative to FY22. And the third variable to our free cash flow calculation is working capital, right? So far, inventory levels have reduced between Q4 and Q3 in the amount of approximately $400 million. We believe that inventory levels have peaked and we're going to work through our order book to continue to deliver on these orders and therefore, this will reduce our inventory levels. At the same time, if the demand remains as steady as we're seeing it, we'll probably need to continue purchases moving forward. So, I feel comfortable at this stage with the guidance we gave you on free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, $2 billion at the midpoint. Let's see how the year plays out, and we will think about giving you more color on how much free cash flow we can generate within that guidance or possibly more.\nOperator: The next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me?\nAntonio Neri:\nAaron Rakers: Sorry, guys. I appreciate taking the questions. Congratulations on the solid results. I want to go back to kind of the Compute side of the business. As we look at the backlog dynamics and the commentary that you've already given. I'm curious of how you guys see component price deflation factoring into your expectations as we move forward. Put another way, is there -- how do you -- how does the Company operate as far as passing through if it's memory cost deflation and so on and so forth. How do we think about the progression of that as you think about the Compute business going through fiscal '23?\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. So, thanks for asking the question, Aaron. You know that we have posted in Q4 an operating profit margin in Compute at 14.7%, which is the highest it's ever been, and it's higher than the outlook we guided you all at SAM, long-term OP margin in Compute of 11% to 13%. And the reason why we have that difference is that we believe as supply continues to ease, there will be the need for us to adjust our pricing down to continue to grow the business moving forward. So, the level of -- at which the AUPs are at today will come down as we pass on the reduction in costs from commodities, DRAMs in particular. We're starting to see some of this, but it's early days. And what's a very, very important Compute on the way up, just like on the way down, is to be extremely reactive and dynamic with our pricing. And we have now the ability to do so globally to push changes in our list prices through our ERP system over a weekend, it needs to be to react to changes in commodity prices and what we're seeing in the competitive environment. So, we remain with our business unit of Compute and the management team there extremely focused on competitive pricing dynamics because for us, it's really critical as we foreshadowed to you that we maintain scale in Compute and continue to capture the lion share of the value in the industry, which we are doing today.\nAntonio Neri: And in 2022, we have shown that we are the best -- are executing that strategy. No question.\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks, Aaron. And Chuck, why don\u2019t we make this the last question?\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our final question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: I guess, my question is really around the Intelligent Edge business and maybe two parts. One, if you could just talk about the 23% growth here is fairly impressive. Any details you can give on kind of what is driving that from a product basis or even backlog versus end demand would be really helpful to understand. And then, Tarek, if I remember, at SAM, you talked about mid-20% operating margins in Intelligent Edge over time. As you look at the path from 13.3% to mid-20%. What do you need to get there? Is there a revenue number or something else just helpful to understand the margin expansion bridge from here? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Let me start, and then Tarek can talk about the margins. I want to be clear, the Edge, 100% demand-driven. Has nothing to do with backlog or any of that. The order book continued to grow in this business. And we are winning. We are taking share. And the reason why we are taking share is because we have a true differentiated value proposition that\u2019s built on three particular layers of the architecture. One is the unification of the connectivity layer with wireless LAN switching and one SD-WAN capabilities. These are both organic and inorganic investments we make over time. Remember, we did the Silver Peak acquisition. We have unique differentiation through our security layer with SASE through both organic and partnerships. And then we have a best-in-class AIOps. That's delivering tremendous value for customers to drive new experiences, to automate everything they do across the enterprise and is 100% driven by the demand at this point in time.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. So, let me elaborate on what Antonio said with regard to your portion of the question that pertains to operating margins. Our operating margin for the Edge was 13.3% in the quarter. It was up annually by 2.4%, right? It was down sequentially 3.2%, but it was up annually 2.4%. I think here, you have a mix effect that is at play between as-a-service offerings and NaaS offerings that play a role in the way the margin fares in the short term. It obviously -- if we're entering the NaaS market, that is because we expect to see the margins -- the gross margins of NaaS to improve over time. So that is one factor. The other factor that has affected the margins very short term, very tactically in Q4 is logistics costs. And I flagged that in my script, logistics cost in Aruba were higher than we would have liked. But that, again, is changing. And so, we expect Aruba to perform as a Rule of 40 company moving forward. And that's the ambition that we have in the medium to long term, which is to maintain high-double-digit growth in Aruba and operating profit margins in the mid-20s range. We're comfortable with that outlook that we announced at SAM.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thank you for all the questions and thank you for making the time today. I want to close with a couple of more additional thoughts. Obviously, we had an outstanding quarter, an exceptionally well-executed quarter for us with record-breaking results across key performance metrics. But when you reflect back, and this is my 20th quarter as the CEO reporting earnings, this is a combination of many things we have done over the last few years. It's not just a onetime thing. When I think about that, first and foremost, we have a clear strategy. We have been executing and accelerating and is winning in the market and is winning with customers. When you have twice a month of logos that we had at the beginning of the year, that tells you customers are entrusting their transformation to HPE. Second is, we are executing better. No question about it, and Q4 was a great example of that. Third is that the demand for our solutions remains steady. And I understand the question about, well, your competitors may have or other vendors have different views. I cannot comment on their views. I'm just telling you, after 20 quarters is what I see, and what we say we do. So in the end, we probably have to take at the face value of what we tell you, and we deliver against that. And then last but not least, in 2020, Tarek and I on Q2 2020, when the pandemic started, we came here, to the call, and we told you we're going to enact a program to reallocate resources to high-growth, high-margin areas and rightsize the Company. We believe we are rightsized going forward. And those actions are paying off, not only because we delivered $175 million net savings to shareholders but because we have now different talent in different locations that give us the confidence that we can execute the strategy. So, it's a combination of four different things we have done over and over and over. In Q4, obviously, with a little bit of easing on supply, we're able to translate all the hard work into record-breaking results, and most importantly, give us the confidence that we entered 2023 with an amazing momentum, and that's why we give the guidance that we give you. And we're going to see every quarter where we stand, but we feel pretty good about our ability to deliver and potentially even exceed those numbers we give for the full year. So, with that, thank you very much. If I don't speak to you before the end of the year, I wish you a happy holidays, to you and your families. So, thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you, and have a great night.",

            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon and thank you for joining our call today. HPE had an impressive fourth quarter, delivering outstanding performance across our key performance metrics. Q4 was HPE's most profitable quarter on a non-GAAP continuing operations basis since 2017, with our second highest quarterly revenue and record quarterly free cash flow. In 2018, we introduced a clear strategy to deliver sustainable long-term value for shareholders. And in 2019, we began our pivot to prioritize recurring revenue through our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. We have refocused our portfolio and our customer value proposition to a high growth and higher gross margin solutions. We also improved our operating leverage across the Company. We are now seeing these strategic actions paying off. In Q4, orders remained steady, showing continued interest in our differentiated edge-to-cloud solutions across industries from enterprises, large and small. Demand over the course of the year was enduring and proved to be better than we anticipated. We closed this fiscal year with a significantly larger order book that we had at the start of the year. I am very proud of our performance in the quarter and in fiscal year 2022. Faced with ongoing macroeconomic challenges, supply constraints and adverse foreign exchange, HPE executed exceptionally well. During the fourth quarter, total HPE revenue climbed 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to almost $8 billion, which was above our sequential outlook as we started to see a slight improvement to ongoing supply constraints. Our Compute and Intelligent Edge businesses had particularly strong revenue growth, each rising more than 20%. Even on these higher revenue base, we grew our non-GAAP operating margin. Non-GAAP operating margin rose to 11.5%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, one of the highest quarterly levels in HPE's history. Non-GAAP gross margin was just above 33%, a 10 basis points improvement year-over-year, reflecting ongoing pricing discipline. As customers continue to turn to our edge-to-cloud solutions, we saw increased demand for our HPE GreenLake platform. Annualized revenue run rate rose 25% year-over-year even with supply constraints as a headwind. Total as-a-service orders again increased more than 30% from a year ago, helping us close the fiscal year with the as-a-service order growth of 68%. In the final quarter of the fiscal year as-a-service orders represented approximately 12% of the total company bookings. Non-GAAP profit in the quarter was a standout. We achieved record quarterly profit, despite the continued unfavorable effects from foreign exchange. Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.57, a 19% sequential rise and 10% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow in the final quarter was just shy of $2 billion, our best ever for a quarter. Free cash flow improved in the second half of the fiscal year 2022, as expected, following better supply chain conversion [Technical Difficulty] and working capital actions as we took to increase cash flow from operations. As we look at our full fiscal year '22 performance, it is clear the HPE GreenLake platform has enhanced our financial profile with more resilient, recurring revenue. Our portfolio is steadily becoming richer in software and services. We continue to shift our next to higher growth markets and more IP-rich offerings. And we continue to invest in our go-to-market capabilities that -- they are solution-led and outcome-based. Since we began our as-a-service pivot in 2019, our AIR has more than doubled to $963 million. We exited fiscal year 2022 with more than $8.3 billion in HPE GreenLake total contract value, more than twice what it was just two years ago. In fiscal year 2022, we produced $28.5 billion of revenue, 5% compared to 2021 and above the 3% to 4% outlook we provided at Securities Analysts Meeting 2021. We achieved this revenue despite not yet having booked all revenue from our Frontier exascale system, which was delayed because our customer needed to extend the acceptance timeframe. Through a combination of pricing actions, portfolio mix shift and cost discipline, we sustained our margins in fiscal year 2022, even in the face of supply constraints, and higher components and logistic costs. We increased our operating margin moving 210 basis points from about 8.5% two years ago to 10.6% for fiscal year 2022. Overall, in fiscal 2022, our operational performance resulted in a record non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $2.02, which came in above the midpoint of the guidance we gave at SAM 2022 in Houston last month, despite ongoing supply impacts, foreign exchange challenges and our exit from Russia and Belarus. We generated the second highest free cash flow in the fiscal year, a total of $1.8 billion, 3 times what it was in fiscal year 2020. We exited fiscal year 2022 with free cash flow at the midpoint of the target we guided at SAM 2022. Our fourth quarter and year-end results position us for continued, durable, profitable growth in fiscal year 2023, and we are confident in the guidance targets we gave last month at SAM. Going into next quarter, we are optimistic demand will sustain globally. It is clear that customers view their data first digital transformation critical to their success and are prioritizing hybrid cloud solutions to propel them forward, particularly in these dynamic times. As we look ahead for the next fiscal year, after many quarters of supply constraint in our market, we are beginning to see some improvements. Demand from the consumer sector is slowing, allowing some substrate capacity to shift to enterprise IT technologies. As a result, we have been able to reduce anticipated lead times for some products. We are continuing to take proactive measures to mitigate supply chain challenges and we are working through our large order book, which has experienced no material cancellations. Over the course of 2023, we expect to see greater easing but not an end to supply shortages. Despite supply constraints, the momentum we have generated with customers for our HPE GreenLake platform has been evident across our financial metrics. HPE GreenLake offers customers a unified and automated secure hybrid cloud experience, integrated across the edge data center colocations and public clouds. It is open, so customers can take advantage of the choice in architecture, but also benefit from the consistent cloud operating model HPE GreenLake provides for all workloads and applications across hybrid IT estates. With a true cloud metering capability, HPE GreenLake enables customers to flex capacity up and down, based on their business needs while benefiting from a wide range of cloud services to protect and analyze their data. Our market-leading differentiators helped us attract more new customers to our platform during the fourth quarter than any other quarter before, leading to twice as many new HPE GreenLake logos to end fiscal year 2022 than we had a year prior. Also, customers are consuming more HPE GreenLake services, increasing usage above their original contract commitments. Our partners are also seeing the relevance of HPE GreenLake with our customers. Partners booked more HPE GreenLake orders during the fourth quarter than they ever did before, extending their streak of orders growth to 22 consecutive quarters. During the fourth quarter, we also saw a greater share of partners booking multiple HPE GreenLake deals. Next week, we will meet face-to-face with several-thousand customers and partners at HPE Discover Frankfurt to discuss hybrid cloud transformation strategies, ways to drive value from the data across the edge-to-cloud, and how to bring the cloud experience to applications and data with HPE GreenLake. At the event, we will unveil important updates to our HPE GreenLake platform. One European customer who has recently adopted the HPE GreenLake platform is SPAR. SPAR is the supermarket you see everywhere in Europe from micro roadside convenience stores to massive one-stop hypermarkets. SPAR has decided to build its own hybrid cloud on HPE GreenLake to run the Company's core business. Our platform is running all major applications of SPAR's innovation engine as the retailer pursues its ambition to create the future of grocery and retail shopping. The HPE GreenLake platform also helps SPAR use data to make strategic decisions on everything from warehousing and logistics to in-store experiences to advance its business. HPE GreenLake is playing an increasingly important role in customers' IT strategies and in addressing all their needs with one unified edge-to-cloud experience. This fiscal year, we performed remarkably well for our customers, our shareholders and our HPE team members. We helped our customers use technology to accelerate the business outcomes while navigating in dynamic environment. Our expanding market leadership demonstrates the trust that customers place in us and the value defined in the differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio that only we can deliver. Demand for our HPE solution has been enduring throughout 2022 and continue to be steady as we move into fiscal year 2023. For our shareholders, by executing our strategy, we have pivoted HPE to a richer mix of software and services that is delivering recurring profitable growth. In fiscal year 2022, we posted strong revenue growth, record-breaking non-GAAP earnings per share and outstanding free cash flow. I am so proud of our team members around the world who have made these results and our transformation possible through their ingenuity and engagement. In fact, this year, HPE achieved one of the highest employee engagement scores in the history of our company, up 20 points over the last five years. Our culture has attracted some of the brightest, most innovative talent in tech. HPE's team members are bringing their energy and ideas to write HPE's next chapter and cement us as the edge-to-cloud market leader. With our team engaged, our strategy taking flight and our market-leading solutions playing critical roles in customers' business, we enter fiscal year 2023 with incredible momentum on all fronts. And I look forward to advancing our strategy and leadership even further in the next year. And with that, I would like now to pass it over to Tarek to make his comments and provide a little bit more details about our financial performance. So, Tarek, over to you. Yes. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. As we said in our commentary, we exited 2022 with a significant larger book than we entered 2022. And that demand was enduring, honestly, was better than we anticipated and remains steady, because when you look at the quarter-over-quarter, Tarek mentioned, was flat. But I think we have a point of differentiation compared to others. I think it's important to recognize. First, we have a diversity of portfolio from edge-to-cloud. And you can see some of the results in the Edge, which obviously are outstanding. I think our HPE GreenLake is unique because it delivers a true hybrid experience that you can consume as-a-service, and that's also dragging the entire portfolio. And when I talk about customers, what we see, customers continue to prioritize digital transformations. And a lot of that is driven by the need to automate, simplify, be more efficient in everything they do and also prioritize that data. The data insights to me, are an important aspect of what customers are looking for. And so, I think demand is there. I think in our case, probably it's better balanced. You asked a question about the geos. I think the performance of the geo has been even, I mean, even across all the 10 geos that we have, and across the segments. I got this question early on, if this is just an enterprise or a small business? No, it is the 10 geos and all the segments from large to small, medium business. In terms of budget, just a month or so ago, we hosted what we call the Board of Advisory, and we have 25 customers that represent multiple industries. And the sentiment there is that they need to continue to digitize and they need to continue to ensure technology plays a vital role. And again, these are technologies in the edge, connectivity being one important aspect. The other one is obviously cloud, but cloud as an experience, not just putting data in one place is a true hybrid approach. And then these data, data-driven insights. And so we are, I think, very uniquely positioned to capture that opportunity. And I will say, Kyle, we just introduced the Gen11 platform. And one of the key differentiation we have -- actually, we have several -- number one is our hybrid design. It was designed with hybrid in mind, meaning the solution gets deployed and managed from HPE GreenLake, whatever you deploy that. Number 2 is continued enhancement on the security side, which is a point of differentiation. And one that really is coming up is sustainability. In our new offer, we actually provide customers with ability to optimize the Compute platform based on carbon footprint and consumption, and we get them also a carbon footprint report. So that allowed them to maximize the usage of the platform while they reduce that carbon footprint. So overall, we continue to see good momentum, and we are bringing new innovation into the platform itself. Yes. Thank you, Shannon. I think a couple of things. So first of all, we ended the year with a 68% year-over-year growth in our bookings. Today, we have now $8.3 billion in total contract value. As you know, those are contracts -- can vary between 3 to 5 years. So, as you can imagine, that gives us a tremendous confidence that we will grow that ARR in the 35% to 45%. We actually closed 2022 with twice as many new HPE logos that we entered now into the 2022 year. And then the important fact is why the mix is shifting is because the Aruba business is all a subscription business. And Tarek made a comment about the automation suite, obviously, software-defined wide area network, and also the subscription to wireless or switching comes through the platform, but also the growth that we've seen in storage. Storage had a great quarter, particularly on our own IP product. That's all software defined, and that's all subscription-based. And what excites Tarek and me is the fact that in 2023, you're going to see an acceleration of that portfolio to HPE Alletra, which -- HPE Alletra had 100% growth sequential. And obviously, that comes also with an incredible attach of Pointnext OS. And also, as we drive that data protection strategy, the incremental value comes from backup and recovery and disaster recovery and ransomware offers. We have now those offers integrated into HPE GreenLake. And so that combination is what's driving the mix shift to more software and services rich offers. So I will add, Simon, that the demand has been enduring and steady throughout the years -- throughout the four quarters in 2022. We exit the year with a significant larger order book. When I think about our differentiation, I think our Compute is differentiated because of HPE GreenLake. It's because of the experience we provide to our Compute platform. And the fact also, if you recall, two years ago, we said we are diversifying our go-to-market as well to attack profitable growth in segments where we did not participated as much, particularly more in the commercial to mid-market space. And one of the areas we saw great growth was through our channel ecosystem. And then, you couple all of that with our pricing discipline and then you get the results of unit growth and revenue growth with amazing profitability. So, I think we have that tailwind. What Tarek covered is all about the revenue side. But on the demand side, it comes to those factors. And I think Gen11 is another step in that direction, which actually gives us tremendous differentiation. Well, as Tarek said in his comments, going forward, we're going to move away from all of these backlog orders and the like to focus on the revenue. That's why we gave the revenue guidance in Q1 because I think it's a better indicator of what we're going to see. I will say, in Q4, what we were able to incrementally convert from the backlog was mid-single-digits, or order book, as we call it now, is very, very large. And in fact, in such segments, particularly in the Edge business, the order book is now bigger at the end of Q4 than it was at the end of Q3. So, the bottom line is that we see that enduring steady demand and we'll take up the entire 2023. And honestly, I'm not sure we will ever exit 2023 to back to historical level. I don't think that will be the case. Because as good as we are trying to convert some incremental aspects of the order book as we go forward to some easing of the supply, the demand continues to be there. So, I think it's going to take a little bit of time. And I think that the order book will return to normal, I would say, historical level, once the incremental capacity comes on line. Because when we saw in this particular quarter some easing, it was because some reallocation of substrate came at the expense of the consumer business, which obviously is down but the incremental capacity is not yet on line, particularly in those older technology nodes, call it, 28, 40 and 65 nanometers, which is where the constraint is. Yes. Thanks, Toni. Let me start, and I will give it to Tarek. As we said, we gave the revenue guidance $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion. I'm not sure it's double digit, but maybe high single digit compared to Q1 2022. But in any case, that guidance includes the recognition of the remaining part of Frontier, which obviously is an important aspect of the HPC. And then the ongoing ability to convert the order book as it comes in, plus the larger order book we already have. And then maintaining a certain level of margin, obviously, which we are confident based on our pricing and operating leverage actions we have taken. So, that's where we stand, and that's where we gave the guidance. As we go through the quarter -- through the year, sorry, we felt prudent at this point in time to maintain it because of the FX uncertainty. Obviously, FX stabilizes or slightly improve, that full year guidance implies there is some potential upside. But also, it's going to come down to the supply availability, as I just made the comments early on. In terms of the free cash flow and the working capital, I will pass it to Tarek. Aaron Rakers: Sorry, guys. I appreciate taking the questions. Congratulations on the solid results. I want to go back to kind of the Compute side of the business. As we look at the backlog dynamics and the commentary that you've already given. I'm curious of how you guys see component price deflation factoring into your expectations as we move forward. Put another way, is there -- how do you -- how does the Company operate as far as passing through if it's memory cost deflation and so on and so forth. How do we think about the progression of that as you think about the Compute business going through fiscal '23? And in 2022, we have shown that we are the best -- are executing that strategy. No question. Yes. Let me start, and then Tarek can talk about the margins. I want to be clear, the Edge, 100% demand-driven. Has nothing to do with backlog or any of that. The order book continued to grow in this business. And we are winning. We are taking share. And the reason why we are taking share is because we have a true differentiated value proposition that's built on three particular layers of the architecture. One is the unification of the connectivity layer with wireless LAN switching and one SD-WAN capabilities. These are both organic and inorganic investments we make over time. Remember, we did the Silver Peak acquisition. We have unique differentiation through our security layer with SASE through both organic and partnerships. And then we have a best-in-class AIOps. That's delivering tremendous value for customers to drive new experiences, to automate everything they do across the enterprise and is 100% driven by the demand at this point in time. Well, thank you for all the questions and thank you for making the time today. I want to close with a couple of more additional thoughts. Obviously, we had an outstanding quarter, an exceptionally well-executed quarter for us with record-breaking results across key performance metrics. But when you reflect back, and this is my 20th quarter as the CEO reporting earnings, this is a combination of many things we have done over the last few years. It's not just a onetime thing. When I think about that, first and foremost, we have a clear strategy. We have been executing and accelerating and is winning in the market and is winning with customers. When you have twice a month of logos that we had at the beginning of the year, that tells you customers are entrusting their transformation to HPE. Second is, we are executing better. No question about it, and Q4 was a great example of that. Third is that the demand for our solutions remains steady. And I understand the question about, well, your competitors may have or other vendors have different views. I cannot comment on their views. I'm just telling you, after 20 quarters is what I see, and what we say we do. So in the end, we probably have to take at the face value of what we tell you, and we deliver against that. And then last but not least, in 2020, Tarek and I on Q2 2020, when the pandemic started, we came here, to the call, and we told you we're going to enact a program to reallocate resources to high-growth, high-margin areas and rightsize the Company. We believe we are rightsized going forward. And those actions are paying off, not only because we delivered $175 million net savings to shareholders but because we have now different talent in different locations that give us the confidence that we can execute the strategy. So, it's a combination of four different things we have done over and over and over. In Q4, obviously, with a little bit of easing on supply, we're able to translate all the hard work into record-breaking results, and most importantly, give us the confidence that we entered 2023 with an amazing momentum, and that's why we give the guidance that we give you. And we're going to see every quarter where we stand, but we feel pretty good about our ability to deliver and potentially even exceed those numbers we give for the full year. So, with that, thank you very much. If I don't speak to you before the end of the year, I wish you a happy holidays, to you and your families. So, thank you for your time today."

            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. Q4 was, no question, an outstanding quarter for HPE. As usual, I will reference slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q4 '22 and fiscal year '22 on slides 4 and 5. Let me discuss our Q4 performance details, starting with slide 6. Sustained demand continues to be a core attribute of our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio, which is translated to record or near-record results. As expected, year-over-year order growth continued to moderate in Q4 '22 to down 16% year-over-year as we lap challenging compares. Having said that, our sequential order growth was flat relative to Q3 '22, which illustrates that demand for our products and services is steady. The key takeaway here is that we are entering fiscal year '23 with an order book that is even higher than the order book we entered fiscal year '22 with, which attests to our momentum for fiscal year 2023. Now that we have closed fiscal year '22, we will again turn our attention to focus on revenues rather than orders as we have been flagging. This is because of timing differences, orders and backlog are not traditionally good indicators of quarterly revenue in normal times. We will continue to disclose orders for our as-a-service and HPE Pointnext OS business. While the supply environment is improving, it is not quite back to pre-pandemic levels. Our large order book contributes to our confidence in our fiscal year '23 revenue outlook of 2% to 4% growth adjusted for currency, and the longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the fiscal year '22 to '25 period we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting in Houston last October. We delivered Q4 revenue of $7.9 billion, which is up 12% annually and 15% sequentially adjusted for currency. This is the second highest revenue figure since our separation transactions in 2017. It would easily have been the highest had revenue recognition from the Frontier deal not slipped into fiscal year '23. The Q4 sequential revenue growth is well above our prior outlook for at least 5% sequential growth. We have had healthy demand throughout the past two years. We now also have improving supply as supply capacity in the consumer electronics markets is redirected towards enterprise markets where demand for digital transformation continues unabated. We closed fiscal year '22 with full year revenue growth of 3% as reported. Currency and our exit from Russia and Belarus represented a 300 basis points headwind to revenue for the full year, which means we ended the year solidly above our initial guidance for 3% to 4% revenue growth adjusted for currency. Our non-GAAP gross margins remain resilient, thanks to the pricing actions we have taken. Our 33.1% non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 is up 10 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a very strong Compute quarter and higher logistics costs in the Edge business. We retain our pricing discipline and continue to shift our mix of business towards higher-margin, software-intensive as-a-service offerings. Non-GAAP operating margins reached a record 11.5%, which represented a 100 basis points increase sequentially and a 180 basis points increase year-over-year. This result would not have been possible without the strategic actions we have taken back in fiscal year '20 to reallocate resources and optimize our cost structure. These actions have put us in the position to benefit from an enhanced operating leverage for several quarters over the past three years, and this will continue in fiscal year '23 and beyond as Antonio and I remain determined to maintain our focus on productivity. Our cost optimization and resource allocation program announced during the pandemic of 2020 and which is now substantially finished, has achieved annual savings of $875 million, well above our initial target of $800 million. As a result, we are now rightsized and we are entering a very different phase of the Company, one where the combination of our enhanced cost structure and substantial order book is expected to deliver profitable growth that is increasingly recurring at higher margins as our as-a-service transformation continues to unfold. Thanks to revenue growth above our guidance, we delivered Q4 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.57, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. This is the highest quarterly non-GAAP net diluted EPS figure since our 2017 separations. Our full year non-GAAP net diluted EPS of $2.02 was at the upper end of our guidance range of $1.96 to $2.04 post Russia and FX and near the midpoint of our SAM 2021 guidance. Again, we estimate FX impacts and our Russia exit combined for a $0.17 EPS headwind in fiscal year '22. Our GAAP P&L reflects a noncash write-down of goodwill in our HPC, AI and software businesses. Macro trends, including contracting market multiples and higher discount rates used in our impairment test for HPC, AI and software, respectively, significantly impacted this outcome. We continue, nonetheless, to be bullish on the HPC, AI segment given our clear number one position in the market, and our outlook for this segment is consistent with what we said at SAM 2022, and software remains a critical component of our HPE GreenLake strategy. I am particularly pleased with our free cash flow performance in Q4 '22, where we generated $3 billion in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $2 billion as we work through our substantial orders and reduce our inventory. As Antonio mentioned, this brought our full year free cash flow to $1.8 billion. This is triple our free cash flow in 2020. For the year, free cash flow met the midpoint of our guidance. In fact, our full year free cash flow met our initial pre-Russia and FX guidance from SAM 2021. Finally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We returned over $1.1 billion in capital to shareholders this year, which represents over 60% of our free cash flow. We paid $154 million in dividends this quarter and repurchased $128 million in stock. That brought our buyback plan to $512 million for the year, above our $500 million target. Our as-a-Service business momentum remains strong and this business is lifting our mix of higher margin recurring revenue. Total as-a-service orders remain robust. Orders grew 33% in Q4 despite lapping 104% growth in Q4 '21. On a constant currency basis, orders grew 43% in Q4 and our full year as-a-service orders grew 68%. This indicates the long-term health of our as-a-service portfolio and further strengthens our confidence in our three-year ARR target of a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year '22 to fiscal year '25. Our ARR of $936 million represented 17% growth as reported and 25% growth in constant currency. For much of fiscal year '22, the industry supply constraints have limited shipments and weighed on our growth rate. We expect the improved supply environment to accelerate our ARR growth moving forward. We also continue to expand our as-a-service's margin as our mix of software and services increased to 66% in Q4, up 4 points year-over-year, thanks to our cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in Edge and Storage. As a result, the gross margins in our as-a-service business remain meaningfully above our corporate gross margins. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. All revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we delivered a record quarterly revenue number. We grew our revenues 23% year-over-year. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share across wireless LAN, enterprise switching and SD-WAN including in some of the largest enterprise customers. Customers are increasingly adopting our Edge services platform and automation software suite. Our operating margin of 13.3% was up 2.4% annually, though down 3.2% sequentially with FX being the biggest contributor to the sequential decline. We continue to expect our Edge business to grow and perform like a Rule of 40 business moving forward. In HPC & AI, revenue fell 11% year-over-year, solely as a result of the Frontier deal slipping into fiscal year '23, which also impacted our operating margin in this segment. We are on track to close that deal in Q1 and have factored that into our guidance. We continue to have orders for HPC & AI solutions of about $3 billion to be delivered in upcoming quarters. Compute revenues grew 22% year-over-year to a near record of $3.7 billion. The segment benefited from the multi-sourcing and demand steering initiatives we have discussed in prior calls, as well as steadily improving supply availability. We have clearly outperformed the competition in fiscal year '22 and our dynamic pricing strategy has helped us navigate a volatile supply climate while maintaining a healthy margin profile. Our Compute operating margin of 14.7% remains well above our long-term outlook for 11% to 13%, which attest of the best-in-class performance delivered by our Compute business. In Storage, we are very pleased to report 6% revenue growth led by all-flash array and HCI. Alletra is one of our fastest ramping new products ever and grew revenue 100% sequentially. In total, revenue from our own IP, margin-rich products rose strong double digits in Q4 and contributed to an annual operating margin of 15.9%, which represents a year-over-year gain of 210 basis points and a sequential gain of 120 basis points. Our storage transformation is now in full swing, as you can see. And we expect our storage business to deliver revenue growth in line with market with our own IP products growing above market. With respect to Pointnext operational services, combined with storage services, orders grew sequentially and for the year rose mid-single digits in constant currency despite the exit of our Russia and Belarus business. Finally, HPE Financial Services expanded its financial volume 3% year-over-year, and revenue rose 6%. Our operating margins fell 3 percentage points year-over-year as we adjust our prices for a higher interest rate climate. It is worth reiterating that our leasing profit dollars are well insulated from a higher rate environment over time as we price on a spread and that our business is resilient in a downturn. Throughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our loss ratio is currently nearing pre-pandemic levels of approximately 0.5%. As a result, our fiscal year '22 HPEFS return on equity remained well above the 18% target we reiterated at SAM 2022. Slide 9 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP net diluted EPS performance. Antonio and I are very pleased that our strategic focus on both the top and bottom lines is evident in these results. Our revenue and EPS continue to grow despite the volatile supply environment, the exit from our Russia and Belarus businesses and increasing headwinds from currency. As mentioned earlier, during fiscal year '22, we experienced a headwind of $0.12 from currency and $0.05 from exiting Russia and Belarus. In spite of these headwinds, we met our SAM '21 non-GAAP guidance for fiscal year '22 and delivered a better mix of higher-margin earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our Edge-to-Cloud strategy. This improvement can be seen on slide 10, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q4 of 33.1%. This is a 10 basis points year-over-year improvement despite a significant revenue mix shift to Compute this quarter. Our growing gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of our strategic pricing actions through the supply challenges and the favorable mix shift we are driving towards higher-margin products across our portfolio. Moving to slide 11, you can observe that we have delivered an 11.5% non-GAAP operating margin for the Company. This is not only up 180 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially, but it is the highest operating margin in the history of the Company since our 2017 separations. Our very strong Q4 revenue performance and our resilient gross margins are certainly leading contributors to the operating margin expansion. And again, as I mentioned at SAM, this performance would not have been possible without the foundation provided by our resource allocation and cost optimization plan that we launched at the start of the 2020 pandemic. On slide 12, let's discuss our setup in China through H3C. As disclosed at SAM, we have extended our existing put option that is struck at 15 time trailing 12-month earnings through to December 31, 2022. We did this to allow our partners time to finalize their engagement with their stakeholders and make our final decision regarding our stake in H3C. Through our commercial contracts and equity interest, H3C has contributed a substantial amount to our EPS and free cash flow and our shareholder value in fiscal year '22. We will balance the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk. We will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer-term solution for this asset. Our cash flow story on slide 13, a test of our outstanding execution. Our Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $3 billion and $2 billion, respectively. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality and our expectations of working capital tailwinds in the second half. We have been strategically building inventory ahead of the competition throughout fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '22 to navigate the supply chain environment. Our inventory balances have now peaked and are beginning to decline as we enter fiscal year '23 and deliver on our substantial order book. Our strong Q4 cash flow brought full year '22 cash flow from operations to $4.6 billion and our free cash flow to $1.8 billion. The $1.8 billion is triple what we delivered in fiscal year '20. It is also at the midpoint of our guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, despite the negative impact of Russia and FX that we estimate to be approximately $250 million. Now turning to our outlook on slide 14. As we discussed, demand for our products and services portfolio remained steady in Q4 relative to Q3. Our view remains one of enduring market demand given the mega trends of digital transformation and the explosion of data. We also believe our own portfolio differentiation will allow market share gains. Let me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure and FX risk. I would like to remind all of you that approximately 55% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies. For Q1 '23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a mid-single-digit seasonal decline that we typically experience in Q1 relative to Q4 of each year. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.32 to $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.50 to $0.58. While we are pleased with our Q1 outlook, we are cognizant given the macroeconomic environment and FX headwinds that it is too early at this stage to rethink our fiscal year '23 guidance. Given the points above, we consider it prudent to assume our year may be more weighted to the first half than is typical. We are, therefore, reiterating our full year '23 guidance. This includes revenue growth of 2% to 4% adjusted for currency, non-GAAP operating profit growth of 4% to 5%, GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.38 to $1.46, non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.96 to $2.04, and free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. In terms of capital returns, we are maintaining our dividends and expect to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year '23, just like we did in fiscal year '22. So to conclude, our results speak for themselves and a test of our outstanding execution in a quarter that can be characterized by enduring demand for our differentiated portfolio of products and services. We look forward to continuing our execution momentum in fiscal year '23. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Yes. Kyle, thanks. I think you understand the trends in our Compute business really well. So, let me reiterate. We ended the year with record quarterly revenues of $3.7 billion. This is a 22% year-over-year growth at constant currency. Unit growth was 4% and AUP was an increase in the high-teens as you foreshadowed. And what's driving the demand for our Compute solutions is richer configs. Customers of all sizes are selecting our Compute solutions to run their private clouds and to power multitude of workloads, data types and applications. And Compute remains and will continue to remain a critical component of our customer transition towards modern edge-to-cloud architectures. And you're right in saying that with these results and the unit increase, our order book in Compute remains strong as we enter fiscal year '23. So, moving forward, trend-wise, what you can expect is, obviously, this level of AUP growth to come down as we'll have to pass on to our customers the benefit of ease -- pricing of commodity easing, but we feel very good about the prospects of Compute in fiscal year '23, given the order book, the fact that our products are more and more differentiated and the need for customers to continue to opt for greater configs. Okay. Sure, Simon. So I would say, if you refer to our prime competitor, I think some of their comments are referring to the consumer side of their operation as much as referred to their enterprise side. Yes. I think overall, so when you look at their results, they were, I would say, not too bad, we did much better than they did. And that is a function of many steps that we have taken in Compute. So there is Gen11 being one of our key solutions now are gaining traction in the market as customers need bigger and richer configs moving forward. Our customers knew that Gen11 was coming and they held their orders firm. So, we had no orders cancellations that are meaningful throughout fiscal year '22. And we finally got the supply that was there to be able to bring our customers to the next-generation compute environment. So, we feel very good about where we are. And to the extent that supply is there, we have a contrasting view relative to our -- what our competitors are signaling with respect to their service business. Yes. Well, thank you, Antonio, and thank you, Toni. So, our free cash flow for fiscal year '23 is going to be driven, obviously, by our earnings, but also reduction in restructuring expense, and you will observe already between '21 and '22 when you have a chance to look at our 8-K filing that restructuring expense is dropping quite considerably. And that trend will continue in FY23 relative to FY22. And the third variable to our free cash flow calculation is working capital, right? So far, inventory levels have reduced between Q4 and Q3 in the amount of approximately $400 million. We believe that inventory levels have peaked and we're going to work through our order book to continue to deliver on these orders and therefore, this will reduce our inventory levels. At the same time, if the demand remains as steady as we're seeing it, we'll probably need to continue purchases moving forward. So, I feel comfortable at this stage with the guidance we gave you on free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, $2 billion at the midpoint. Let's see how the year plays out, and we will think about giving you more color on how much free cash flow we can generate within that guidance or possibly more. Yes. So, thanks for asking the question, Aaron. You know that we have posted in Q4 an operating profit margin in Compute at 14.7%, which is the highest it's ever been, and it's higher than the outlook we guided you all at SAM, long-term OP margin in Compute of 11% to 13%. And the reason why we have that difference is that we believe as supply continues to ease, there will be the need for us to adjust our pricing down to continue to grow the business moving forward. So, the level of -- at which the AUPs are at today will come down as we pass on the reduction in costs from commodities, DRAMs in particular. We're starting to see some of this, but it's early days. And what's a very, very important Compute on the way up, just like on the way down, is to be extremely reactive and dynamic with our pricing. And we have now the ability to do so globally to push changes in our list prices through our ERP system over a weekend, it needs to be to react to changes in commodity prices and what we're seeing in the competitive environment. So, we remain with our business unit of Compute and the management team there extremely focused on competitive pricing dynamics because for us, it's really critical as we foreshadowed to you that we maintain scale in Compute and continue to capture the lion share of the value in the industry, which we are doing today. Yes. So, let me elaborate on what Antonio said with regard to your portion of the question that pertains to operating margins. Our operating margin for the Edge was 13.3% in the quarter. It was up annually by 2.4%, right? It was down sequentially 3.2%, but it was up annually 2.4%. I think here, you have a mix effect that is at play between as-a-service offerings and NaaS offerings that play a role in the way the margin fares in the short term. It obviously -- if we're entering the NaaS market, that is because we expect to see the margins -- the gross margins of NaaS to improve over time. So that is one factor. The other factor that has affected the margins very short term, very tactically in Q4 is logistics costs. And I flagged that in my script, logistics cost in Aruba were higher than we would have liked. But that, again, is changing. And so, we expect Aruba to perform as a Rule of 40 company moving forward. And that's the ambition that we have in the medium to long term, which is to maintain high-double-digit growth in Aruba and operating profit margins in the mid-20s range. We're comfortable with that outlook that we announced at SAM."

As we have demonstrated throughout 2022, HPE is delivering for our customers and our shareholders. In the third quarter, HPE grew revenues, increased profits and strengthened gross margins through steady operational focus and execution and despite continued tight supply conditions and unfavorable foreign exchange. In our results, you will see the customer demand for our industry leading portfolio. We continue to accelerate our recurrent revenue this fiscal year, which validates the compelling value proposition we offer our customers, and the long and the strong response to HPE GreenLake, our unified edge-to-cloud as-a-service platform. Customers continue to prioritize investments in IT. They find HPE's technology solutions to be particularly relevant in today's complex macroeconomic environment where technology innovation is critical to accelerate business transformation and deliver important business outcomes. In the third quarter, total HPE revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $7 billion, which was also above the sequential outlook we have given. New orders exceeded our expectations, despite finally starting to decelerate the growth rates, bringing our quarterly exit backlog to another record level. That is significant, considering that for the previous four consecutive quarters, we have grown orders 20% or more year-over-year. We continue to see robust customer demand in the market and a high-quality, durable sales pipeline. Our HPE GreenLake customer base is growing, and our customers are [voting] (ph) with their workloads and data. In Q3, we doubled HPE GreenLake new level of growth year-over-year, and our existing HPE GreenLake customers continue to renew and expand contracts with us. The HPE GreenLake platform has an exabyte of data under management and customers worldwide connect more than 2 million devices to it. The momentum is reflected on annualized revenue run rate up 28% and total as-a-service orders up 39% year-over-year, bringing our year-to-date orders growth to 86%. These indicators show enduring demand for our as-a-service solutions, even while supply constraints limited some installations. Once again, we expanded gross margins in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin of 34.7% was up 0.5 points sequentially and matched the highest we have ever generated since we began our as-a-service business in 2019. We improved non-GAAP operating margin even more than gross margin to 10.5% this quarter, up 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.48, a 9% sequential rise and 2% year-over-year. Our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion, and our free cash flow in the quarter was $587 million. This is in line with our typical seasonality as we improve cash conversion cycles in the second half. From a supply chain perspective, the dynamics remained largely unchanged from the last few quarters, with certain components still in tight supply, which limited shipments. However, we have made progress in proactive measures we have taken to enhance the resilience of our supply chain, including steering demand for products that do not require supply-constrained components, offering new multi-sourcing options and implementing [proper](ph) design changes to our world-class engineering capabilities. We could also see some easing in supply condition, if consumer demand continued to slow and component capacity shift towards enterprise customers. Overall, we expect supply chain to remain challenged, supply to remain challenged into next year, although with some very early signs of potential easing in the near term. We remain focused on translating customer demand into profitable revenue growth, as shown in our Q3 results. Customers continue to tell us that they need to drive their important digital transformation work while managing costs. And it is clear we commit those needs with our edge-to-cloud portfolio delivered through the HPE GreenLake platform. HPE GreenLake brings a unified hybrid cloud experience to our customers data and workloads enabling them to consume IT as utility. In June, I was thrilled to join 80,000 customers and partners, again, in person in Las Vegas at HPE Discover. We unveiled a series of new cloud services and enhancements for the HPE Connect platform to further advance the hybrid cloud experience for customers. We were particularly excited to announce HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise, which addresses customers' desire for their own automated, flexible enterprise-grade private cloud. We recognize the important role our partner ecosystem plays in our success and the success of our customers to continue to expand our growing partner ecosystem and enable them to adapt to customers' evolving requirements, we launched a new program that helps partners build their business on top of our HPE GreenLake platform. Customers are entrusting HPE GreenLake with their most critical workloads and applications. Japan card network, Japan's leading credit card payment network and an existing HPE GreenLake customer expanded its contract in Q3 to add a 100% for [Indiscernible] platform running on HPE NonStop servers, with an integrity -- with an integrated softwares. The new implementation will power the CARDNET systems demanding, transaction-intensive applications as Japanese consumers rapidly increase use of credit cards and cashless payments. In India, the country's largest public sector steel producer also expanded adoption of the HPE GreenLake platform to increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. By modernizing its critical S&P environment with HPE GreenLake, the organization can respond more quickly to business demand and help reduced its data center footprint by over 16% to help reach sustainability goals. These are just two examples of existing customers doubling down on HPE GreenLake platform to address new needs. We see this as an important endorsement of the valuable role HPE GreenLake plays in our customers' IT strategy. At the edge, we continue to drive innovation with our solutions. Aruba had an impressive quarter with revenue rising 12% year-over-year and orders increasing more than 15% for the seventh consecutive quarter. In Q3, Aruba announced new AIOps capabilities to reduce the time IT teams spent on manual tasks like network troubleshooting, performance tuning and security enforcement. These new AI basing sites leverage Aruba's industry-leading data lake from more than 120,000 Aruba users who are now on the HP Connect platform to enhance visibility, operations and the user experience. Our Edge technology was on display early this month as we created a secure network to power the Birmingham Commonwealth Games 2022 in the UK. Aruba provided the games network connecting thousands of staffs and volunteers and over 4,400 athletes across 20 venues and 38 concurrent events to ensure smooth execution of the games. Committed to leaving a legacy of digital sustainability in the region, HP is now working with the local organization to make the technology used for the event available to the community, including schools and hospitals. As data continues to grow and evolve rapidly, we are seeing customers use our technology to allow data in incredible ways. Catharina Hospital, one of the largest hospital and leading centers for heart diseases in the Netherlands is using HPE Ezmeral software to build a cloud native data lake house that security collects and analyzes anonymized patient data from internal and external sources. This will accelerate mobile training and tech anomalies among the 500,000 electrocardiograms already available for these analysis with higher precision to identify the correct diagnosis and treatment. And in one of the most exciting breakthroughs to showcase the power of AI at scale, earlier this month, I was pleased to visit the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to celebrate Frontier, the world's first fastest and greenest exascale supercomputer that HP built for the lab. Frontier represents a new area of scientific discovery and innovation that will strengthen US national security and industrial competition. HPE has a long history of industry first and one-of-a-kind innovation that advances societal progress. We see this as a part of our purpose to advance the way people live and work. We also delivered on our purpose through our commitment to create a more equitable and sustainable world. Early this summer, we took the bold step of accelerating our net zero carbon emission target by 10 years to 2040. Effective strategy to achieve net zero carbon emissions, are a cornerstone of corporate longevity, and we continue to help customers drive their own sustainable transformation. I'm proud of HPE's Q3 performance and the progress we are making to cement our position as the leading edge-to-cloud company. When I speak to customers, it is very rewarding to hear how they are using our differentiated portfolio to solve their most critical business problems. Every day, we are proving how essential HPE is to the customers and communities we serve. We couldn't do this without the dedication of our 60,000 team members who impress me every day with their bold innovation and disciplined execution. We have crafted a strategy at HPE that is winning in the marketplace, and I'm confident in our ability to execute on our commitments with strong demand, a solid pipeline and a unique edge-to-cloud offering that is delivering revenue growth and expanded gross margins and operating margins for our company. I look forward to updating you about our strategic priorities and outlook when we host our Security Analyst Meeting in late October. I hope you will join to hear how we plan to continue to generate value for HPE's shareholders. Let me now ask Tarek to discuss our performance in detail and go through our business segment results. Tarek, over to you.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slide 1. So, now let me discuss our Q3 performance details, starting with Slide 2. We continue to see healthy demand across our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio. As expected, year-over-year order growth rates moderated to down 9% this quarter as we begin to lap challenging compares. As a reminder, orders were up 29% year-over-year in Q3 of fiscal year 2021. We continued to grow our backlog sequentially this quarter to a new record level that is up 96% year-over-year. Our backlog is also expected to be roughly flat next quarter and remains firm with no meaningful cancellations. This maintains our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year 2022 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% growth adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 Securities Analyst Meeting. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $7 billion, up 4% year-over-year and above our outlook of up low-single-digits sequentially despite an ongoing challenging supply environment and greater currency headwinds. Based on current rates, we now expect currency to be a 2.5-point headwind to revenue for the full year as opposed to the 50 basis points expected at the start of our fiscal year. We continue to be very pleased with the resiliency and expansion of our non-GAAP gross margins, despite the inflationary environment and ongoing supply chain disruptions that are driving up material and logistics costs. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 34.7%, up 50 basis points sequentially and flat year-over-year, driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings. Non-GAAP operating margins were 10.5%, up 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year, reflecting operating leverage from strong gross margin and OpEx savings from our cost optimization actions taken during the pandemic. We expect to gain further operating leverage in the short term, as we drive more revenue growth and benefit from investments in the high-growth, margin rich areas of our portfolio. With our better-than-guided revenue growth, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.48, up 9% sequentially despite elevated input costs from the ongoing industry-wide supply constraints and foreign exchange impact. As previously indicated, cash flow from operations is following our normal seasonality this year, and working capital has also turned into a tailwind in the second half. In Q3, we generated $1.3 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $587 million. We continue to make further investments in strategic inventory to navigate the current supply environment, and we are now at peak inventory levels. We will begin to work our inventory balance down next quarter and into the following year, and I'll touch more on that shortly in our outlook. Finally, we continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $156 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October. We also repurchased $197 million in shares, on track towards our goal of at least $500 million of share buybacks executed this fiscal year and bringing our year-to-date total capital returns to $851 million, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation. Slide three highlights key metrics demonstrating our progress in our as-a-service business, with more recurring revenue at higher margins. Total as-a-service orders remained robust, up 39% year-over-year as we begin to lap more challenging compares. Our year-to-date as-a-service orders are up 86%, which is the best indicator of the long-term health of this business and supports our confidence in achieving our three-year ARR CAGR target of 35% to 45% from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024. Our ARR growth rate improved from last quarter and was up 28% year-over-year to $858 million, but still face supply constraints continuing to limit some installations. We also continue to expand our as-a-service margins as our mix of both software and services continues to increase to 64% in Q3, up 6 points year-over-year, with our expanding cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in Edge and Storage. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on slide four. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, we achieved both a record level of orders and revenue in the quarter. We grew orders double digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and have roughly 20 times our normal levels of backlog. Revenue growth accelerated to 12% year-over-year, outperforming the competition and demonstrating particular strength in Silver Peak, and our Edge-as-a-Service offerings, both up strong double digits. We delivered operating margins of 16.5%, up 390 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the improving operating leverage in this business and this despite higher component and logistics costs. In HPC and AI, revenue grew 15% year-over-year and backlog of awarded contracts remained robust at just under $3 billion. Our Q3 operating profit margin was 3.4%, up 9 points sequentially and is expected to increase further next quarter, with the recognition of large deals. In compute, demand remained robust with backlog growing sequentially to another record and is now at five times normal levels. Revenue was down 1%, reflecting a continued difficult supply environment with some improvement expected next quarter with new multi-sourcing options for certain components and demand steering towards new solutions. We also continue to be very focused on executing our dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistic costs and gives us a very high-quality backlog. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.3%, up 210 basis points year-over-year and still well above our long-term target set at SAM 2021 of 11% to 13%. Within Storage, we achieved another record level of backlog and revenue was up 1%. We continue to emphasize our own IP margin reach products that were up double digits, including nimble and hyper-converged. Our as a service offerings within storage like Block are also leading order and ARR growth among our business segments. With the favorable mix shift, our operating margins improved to 14.7%, up 210 basis points sequentially. With respect to Pointnext operational services, combined with storage services, orders grew again and are up year-to-date mid-single digits in constant currency, similar to levels for total fiscal year '21 despite the exit of our Russia business. As you know, this is a key component of recurring revenue and profits for each of our segments. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 4% year-over-year in constant currency with strong performance in GreenLake and revenue rose 1%. It's worth noting that our leasing business is well insulating from rising interest rates over time, as we price based on a spread and customers often choose to extend their leases during uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Our profitability also continues to benefit from higher residual value realization and bad debt write-offs have returned to pre-COVID levels. Our operating margin was 11.8%, up 70 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 19.5% remains well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance, where you can see our revenue and EPS continue to grow despite the difficult supply environment, the exit from our Russia business and increasing headwinds from currency. Year-to-date through Q3, we have already experienced a headwind of $0.05 from currency and $0.03 from exiting Russia. In spite of these headwinds, we delivered a better mix of higher-margin earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our edge to cloud strategy. This improvement can be seen on Slide 6, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q3 of 34.7%, up 50 basis points sequentially, and flat year-over-year, showing their resilience in spite of the increased component and logistics costs. This was driven by both our strategic pricing actions and the favorable mix shift we have been driving to edge on IP storage and our as a Service business. Moving to Slide 7. You can see our non-GAAP operating margins this quarter of 10.5%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 70 basis points year-over-year. This reflects revenue growth combined with both gross margin expansion and OpEx savings to give us strong operating leverage across the business. This has also been achieved while continuing to invest more in both R&D and our go-to-market in strategic areas of the business for future growth. On Slide 8, let's spend some time reminding everyone about the status of our unique setup in China through H3C. As disclosed in late April, we have extended our existing put option that is stuck at 15 times trailing 12-month earnings through to October 31, 2022. We did this to enable the new investors at the Unigroup level to complete their restructuring and are now determining the longer-term path forward for our stake. We value our presence in China, the second largest and fastest-growing IT market, although prior to the execution of any extension, we will balance the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk. H3C makes up a significant portion of our P&L and cash flow, and you can see that we are generating growing value to shareholders with our unique setup. Our equity interest rose 21% in fiscal year 2021 and has grown another 9% in this Q3. Needless to say, we will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer-term solution for this valuable asset. Turning to Slide 9. Our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion in Q3. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality and our expectations of working capital tailwinds in the second half. We have been strategically building inventory throughout this year to navigate the supply chain environment. While we still expect to start working down inventory levels in Q4, it will take longer than expected and into fiscal year 2023, but still puts us in a better position to convert the continued order demand into revenue and cash in future quarters. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 10. As discussed, Antonio and I are very pleased with the continued demand strength and growing backlog that gives us confidence in achieving our original SAM revenue guidance in fiscal year 2022 for growth of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency that now includes a 2.5-point headwind from foreign exchange rates on a full year basis. More specifically for Q4 2022, we expect revenue to be up at least 5% sequentially as reported, which includes the larger currency headwind. This is still above our normal seasonality to reflect some improvements in supply due to the full resumption of factories activity in China and our actions to multi-source, more components and steer the demand. From an EPS perspective, we are tightening our fiscal year 2022 non-GAAP outlook range as we move towards the end of the year to $1.96 to $2.04. This reflects the impact from the supply environment, which we expect to sustain into Q4, and further appreciation of the U.S. dollar since last quarter. As a result, this implies that for Q4 2022, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.32 to $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.52 to $0.60. Furthermore, our free cash flow is also being impacted by exiting our Russia business as well as headwinds from unfavorable currency movements that were previously absorbed in our prior outlook. As a result, we now expect to deliver fiscal year 2022 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. So overall, I am very pleased with our results in the quarter that can be characterized by sustained demand and very solid execution, navigated a continued challenging supply environment. With record levels of high-quality backlog, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing edge-to-cloud opportunity and close out a strong fiscal year 2022. We look forward to seeing you at our next Securities Analyst Meeting in October to provide our outlook for the fiscal year and beyond. Now with that, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I wanted to talk a bit about the relative strength in your guidance and how you're thinking about your backlog and that, obviously, contrasting that with your competitor that reported last week, who had much more conservative or dire outlook on demand, frankly. So I'm curious, how have you stress tested the backlog? I mean what gives you confidence in coming out and effectively taking up guidance because there's more of a currency hit now. So just any color you can give us maybe even on a geographic basis or a vertical basis in terms of what you're hearing and seeing? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. Thank you, Shannon, for the question. I may start, and then Tarek, please feel free to add your comments. I mean, I will say, this quarter, Shannon, was characterized, in my mind, by enduring customer demand. And you see what the backlog is now. I mean, it's a record level, more than 3x normal historical seasonality in some segments. It's just amazing to see the demand momentum, think about the Aruba 20 times historical levels and even Compute five times historical levels. So that's very pleasing. And I think it's a testament of our value proposition, because GreenLake is a pull-through platform for us across every aspect of our portfolio. As we said on the supply chain, the supply chain dynamics remain largely unchanged. But what has changed for us is that over the months and the quarter, we have taken actions to dual source or to steer demand in our products and then obviously implement design changes. I think because of our combination of our portfolio and customer segments, we believe we are very well positioned to move forward through this challenge as we go into next quarter and into 2023. But we expect supply to remain challenged as we get into 2023. That said, I mean, the fact of the matter is that we believe that, ultimately, we're going to see easing signs because of the -- of what we see in the consumer space and even in automotive and industrial, which are a conversation with the suppliers as they start thinking now how to balance that supplier substrate and then obviously, enterprise is well positioned. In terms of clearing the backlog, this is going to still take quite a bit of time, and that's a good news for us, because it gave us momentum in Q4 in 2023, which is great because remember, two things have happened in that backlog. Number one is price for a strong gross margin as Tarek just went through. So in many ways, it's protected for that gross margin. And number two, we have not seen any meaningful cancellation of all.\nTarek Robbiati : Yes. Shannon, if I can add on a couple of comments. What we're doing is we are engineering new solutions that are less dependent on components that are experiencing shortages. We're steering demand toward those solutions, and this is across every facet of our portfolio. We are also multi-sourcing the most constrained components, and this is helping working through the backlog. But as Antonio said, this will remain a challenged environment into next year. And that is actually for us an opportunity to continue to drive revenue with high-quality margins into fiscal year 2023. I do want to pick up on your point that you made very rightly about the guidance and having absorbed 200 basis points incremental in foreign exchange terms. This is a very important point. 200 extra basis points of headwind is about $580 million of revenue. You multiply this by the OP margin, and you can really look at what impact would that have had on EPS. So we are very pleased with the performance of our business. And the fact that in spite of substantial foreign exchange headwinds, we are able to maintain the revenue guide of 3% to 4% in constant currency, and therefore, our EPS guide as a result. So thanks for pointing that out.\nAntonio Neri: One more thing, Shannon, is for you to also understand is that as we continue to grow the as-a-service component of this, the solutions for storage, compute, private clouds and the like are more standardized, which give us a better predictability on that front. So that will also help us move through this supply tight environment.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks for the question, Shannon. Can we get the next one please operator?\nOperator: The next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall : Great. Maybe building upon that question. The OpEx or kind of your EPS commentary would indicate maybe slightly higher OpEx into Q4, particularly given kind of the gross margin levers that you saw in the last quarter. So you noted some of that is FX adjusted, but I would think that there's kind of an FX tailwind on the OpEx piece. And so I just wanted to get a sense of -- is it -- are you seeing larger than expected expenses and OpEx? Is there less gross margin leverage as maybe we recognize some higher priced inventory? Just anything to note there into Q4 would be helpful. Thanks.\nTarek Robbiati: Of course, Meta. Thanks for asking the question. So FX is, obviously, a headwind to revenue because 55% of our revenue in the company is denominated in non-US dollar currencies. But it's -- as you point out, a tailwind to OpEx to some degree. Some of the cost that we incur is therefore lower on a dollar basis. Net-net FX is a headwind to operating profit and EPS. And so we started our cost containment in the middle of the pandemic, as you may recall, in April, May 2020. And we stay disciplined on OpEx moving forward. And this is shown to you by our gross and operating margin performance. We feel comfortable about our gross margin trend, and we believe per my script, that there is further opportunity to extract operating leverage in Q4 and beyond, thanks to the growth in high margin areas of our portfolio such as the edge. I feel pretty comfortable about the situation. If you look at our gross margins, to add more color, they're up 50 basis points sequentially and flat year-on-year. And this is in spite of an inflationary environment that would put a lot of pressure on supply chain, logistics costs and material costs, obviously, but also on labor costs. So on the whole, look for our margins and where they stand relative to those headwinds that we just discussed.\nAntonio Neri: I will admit a couple of things. First of all, year-over-year, you see a slight decline in OpEx as a percent of revenue, but that OpEx that we report, obviously, large maturities, R&D and FXD. But when you look at that OpEx as a productivity lever against our orders and what we have done, you can see with the backlog we have, we have improved our productivity particular on the sales force side. And then in R&D, to Tarek's point, we started this program in Q2 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic. In fact, I will say we were the first company to come out with a resource allocation and optimization program that allow us to manage cost in a discipline way that reposition resources in the areas of growth we want to drive going forward. And so Tarek also said, we will continue to see operating leverage as we convert the backlog and we scale that revenue, which obviously, we have a significant backlog. But as a percent of the order momentum, the productivity has significantly improved.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks Meta for the question. Operator, can we go to the next one, please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I'm wondering, if you could just comment on linearity throughout the quarter in terms of orders and whether you saw any degradation. And then I was hoping you could just maybe help quantify the aggregate backlog because, as you noted, your order compares are very difficult going forward, 20% plus for the last four quarters. So if orders end up being down 10% a year for the next three or four quarters, that's $2.8 billion less in orders. My sense is, you may have $3 billion or $4 billion in incrementally higher backlog than normal. So that would still suggest reported revenue growth could grow. But I'm wondering if you can also just sort of talk to that dynamic of, the tough order comps and likely facing negative order growth and whether the backlog ultimately measures up according to the math that I outlined that should make everyone feel good about continued revenue growth. Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Sure. So this -- it's a great question, Toni. So first and foremost, I want to point out to you that our -- we don't comment and give a specific figure on the backlog. But suffice is to say that it's close to double what it used to be last year this time of the year. That's the first point to take away, and we're working through it and its firm. There are no meaningful cancellations. So that's a tailwind to revenue generation, and we are executing better and better in our global operations team to convert that backlog into revenues. Orders are there. And they are there when you really look at segment by segment, we give you in our presentation, the detail of the order growth. So you can see the order growth in the Edge, for example, which has been on relentless, we've had seven quarters in a row of substantial order growth at the Edge in double digits. And the same holds true for other parts of our portfolio. The HPC, AI has its own dynamics with futures and a substantial order book north of $3 billion. So demand is not slowing to the point where this affects our fiscal year 2023 guide that we gave you at SAM last year, and we reiterated during the course of this year. We still see continuous demand. Even in Q3, the demand was sustained across the portfolio in Compute, in Storage, in HPC, AI at the Edge. It's probably lower than what it used to be four quarters ago for obvious reasons. These are tough compares. But the way to think about it is that the tide has come up. And maybe now the tide is a little bit catching its breath, but it's still there relative to where we were at the pandemic data point.\nAntonio Neri: I will say, Toni, just to add on that, we use the word steady, because, obviously, you can't use the word growth in the context of the compares here. But steady. Steady, and then within the steadiness, we have growth in some unique segments that continue. And Tarek talked about the Edge, we have a 20 times backlog in that business. And even on Compute, we still have 5 times. So -- and the other thing to remember here is that GreenLake is an accelerator of orders intake, because that creates us momentum in renewing and expanding and cross-selling across the business. So I think the original guidance we gave us at SAM last year, which was 2% to 4% over the long-term period, still absolutely true. And then when we get together at SAM here at the end of October, we're going to tell you what we're going to do specifically for 2023. But I sit here today and I feel pretty good about the momentum we have, because demand is steady, and our strategy is resonating with the pivot to as-a-service.\nToni Sacconaghi: Thank you.\nAndrew Simanek: Perfect. Thanks, Toni. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please, go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Yes, I wanted to get back to the kind of as-a-service and ARR businesses. You guys are sticking to the longer-term guide here, its a little acceleration from what we've seen this past quarter. Could you just kind of dig into that a little bit? What are you seeing that's going to sustain that level of high growth over multiple years of the new programs or new products that are going to maybe transition the model so that we can keep that 25 to \u2013 I'm sorry, 35% to 45% growth rate for ARR? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. Well, our as-a-service transformation through Edge-To-Cloud platform, GreenLake, is my number one priority and it's central to our strategy to bring that unified hybrid cloud experience that everybody is talking in the market. Ultimately, customers want to consume IT solutions in different ways. And this IT utility model is growing very, very rapidly. And I would argue, we were the first with our strategy. And so we have a little bit of head start here. And you see that in our order momentum, right, year-to-date. We grew the as-a-service bookings by 86%. And so clearly, that gives you the confidence that the 35% to 45% is absolutely achievable. But what it gives me more confidence, honestly, Tim, is the fact that, when I was at Discover just two months ago, and you look at the breadth of our solutions through the platform, and the experience that we provide, whether it's to deploy connectivity anywhere in your enterprise or where to deploy a private cloud that we came out with the new private cloud enterprise solutions, where you can run any type of workload, whether it's virtualized, containerized, or bare-metal, or whether to deploy data solutions to extract value from the data is growing. And that platform today has now more than an exabyte of data under management and 2 million devices under management as well. So our confidence to deliver the 35% to 45% is absolutely there. And remember that, at the last Security Analyst Meeting, we guided by the end of 2024 to have an ARR close to $2.3 billion, and we believe we are on track to do that. Tarek, do you have any comments on that?\nTarek Robbiati: I think you said very well, Antonio, we simply emphasize one thing strategically is, clearly, the word is now hybrid. Our customers have spoken, the market has spoken, the world is hybrid. For us to scale an as-a-service business in a hybrid world for any player to do so, you need to build a platform. Without the platform, you cannot scale, durably scale and take advantage of the hybrid world. And when you really look at what that means, it translates into higher margins in this business over time. The margins of this business are getting richer and richer as we add more services onto the platform and more software content onto the offerings. And we've made meaningful progress increasing our software and services mix by six point's year-over-year to the current level of about 64%. And we are targeting over 75% by fiscal year 2024 as we add more and more software content with storage data services such as Zerto, we add more softer content with networking services such as Silver Peak and new workloads. So we believe that our ARR is already well above corporate average gross margins, and we are driving it to even higher levels by adding more and more software, high-value content.\nTim Long: Great. Thank you very much.\nAndrew Simanek: Thanks for the question, Tim. Next one, please.\nOperator: The next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the October quarter guide and what you're implying here. I think the implication is margins are going to be up about 100 basis points, if not more sequentially. And Tarek, I know you talked about better mix potentially there. But maybe you can just help us understand how do you think revenues could look like sequentially versus historical seasonality in October? And then as you think about this 100 basis plus margin expansion, on the operating line sequentially, what are the big enablers of that? If you kind of call this out, that would be helpful.\nTarek Robbiati: Yeah. Okay. So let me try and break that down for you through the P&L, Amit. We're entering Q4 with, as Antonio said, enduring demand and a record backlog. And yes, there are still uncertainties in supply chain and the macroeconomic environment with FX. In spite of this, we believe we can grow revenue in -- by at least 5% on an as-reported basis. And this reflects above normal seasonality with some supply improvement, but we will still face also a greater currency impact. And so if you take that 5% revenue growth on an as-reported basis and you assume that gross margins will be down modestly quarter-over-quarter, you have to make that assumption because Compute margins will return to more historical ranges. You combine that with the fact that OpEx should be down modestly because of the measures we're taking and the pause we're putting on hiring and expenses that are discretionary in nature, or I&E will probably remain flat to slightly down quarter-on-quarter given the higher interest expense that we are seeing due to interest rates increasing. Tax rate will remain stable. You can assume a 14% effective tax rate as guided at SAM. You take all of that math of revenue, gross margin, OpEx or I&E and tax and you get to the guide that we gave you of $0.52 to $0.60 non-GAAP EPS for Q4 2022.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you for running the whole model to what we have here.\nAndrew Simanek: Appreciate. Thanks for the question, Amit. Next one please.\nOperator: Next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yea. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to kind of the operating margin sustainability and particularly around the compute segment. If we look back over the past several quarters, you've seen anywhere from high single-digit to kind of high-teens declines on a unit basis. However, ASPs have been up 10% to 20% year-over-year. So I guess my question is, how are you thinking about the durability of that profitability given that ASP uplift that we've seen over the past several quarters. And can you kind of separate the pricing uplift that you've seen between mix versus the pass-through of increased component pricing over the past few quarters? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah. Maybe I'll start and then I'll give it to Tarek. Thank you for the question. I mean, obviously, we are managing our -- the Compute business very different than our competition. And you see that in our operating margin performance, right, 13.3%, which is over 200 basis points year-over-year up. But we always guided you and the rest of the Street on an 11% to 13%. So we expect that over time to return to those levels, somewhere in that range. But at the same time, we continue to be incredible discipline in pricing. And that backlog that we have, which is now five times historical levels has been priced with that in mind, with that pricing discipline. And so that's why it gives us the confidence that as we go through the next handful of quarters here, we continue to see solid performance. But in the end, we will see, obviously, the balance between units and AUPs, because particularly, memory pricing will start taking effect. But at the same time, we are focusing also on profitable growth units in different segments of the market. And one strategy to do so is our GreenLake platform, because we are able to reach different customers with different configs with a margin that's more accretive, particularly because all the GreenLake's deals comes with the attach of Pointnext XOS. And one area you're going to see us also shifting is the software that comes with our compute platform, will be delivered also as a SaaS offering on the GreenLake platform as we have now entered or soon to be entered GEN-11. So, there is that dynamic of unit pricing and then offer configuration with us that we're going to drive through the next generation here. But that 11% to 13% is more reasonable in our mind. And clearly, we are doing so by managing our backlog and new orders intake. Tarek, do you have any comments on that?\nTarek Robbiati: Can I just add a little bit more color on the revenue AUP units dynamic here, right? So, I want to flag that our backlog consists of very healthy increases in both units and AUPs, right? The revenue in every quarter is more and more coming from the backlog. And specifically for Q3, regarding units and AUPs, units were down in high-teens because of supply chain tightness, but AUPs rose also in the high-teens because of richer configs. And the pricing actions that we've taken place. So, it remains a very dynamic business to watch for. Antonio flagged the need to monitor RAM prices, which we're doing on a daily basis. And we can be very quick at flipping our pricing strategy the other way should the market realign. But I think the longer-term trend that I would like you to focus on is the richer configs. These are the lead driver and the more structural driver of AUP increases rather than the pricing tools and measures that we can take. And we are very, very pleased overall with the way we're driving price margin units and mix in this compute business. And as Antonio pointed out, at 13.3% OP margins, this is by far the most profitable compute server business in the industry.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks for the question, Aaron. Next one, please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Tarek, maybe just to follow-up on that pricing commentary. When you think about the structural versus the cyclical impacts, any way you can parse that on how much of that pricing you're seeing is structural versus cyclical? And as you're talking about the supply improvements, how should we reconcile that with the backlog remaining elevated? If we look into fiscal 2023, we start to see moderation over there in unit growth and AUP soften. Can you just help us think through the impact to cash flows as well? Thank you so much.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. So, it's hard to really parse out what is structural by way of configs and/or pricing related with respect to what drives our overall AUP in the compute business. And the reason for it is, our own actions. We have started to steer the demand towards new configs where we do have the supply and particularly the Gen10 plus servers are very successful in the market today. And these are, by definition, higher config relative to the Gen10. And so, I would say a large chunk of the success that we have there is driven by our own engineering and the steering of the demand to be able to fulfill the orders that we have in the backlog. And then specifically for cash flow, overall, at the company level, the dynamic that you all need to take into account is starting from the revenue growth that we flagged, which would be at least 5% on a revenue basis, reported basis, applying the margins commentary that we discussed, you're going to have a certain amount of cash earnings growth in Q4 sequentially relative to Q3. But the most important driver of free cash flow in Q4 is our cash flow conversion cycle. We already started to see in Q3 as foreshadowed the working capital becoming a tailwind. And in Q4, as we turn through our backlog, and we drive, therefore, higher revenues, we're also going to drive inventory levels down. And our overall cash conversion cycle will move from a positive 18 today to a negative figure, which is favorable to free cash flow generation in Q4. That's the key dynamic that I want you to take away as we work through the inventory, the inventory has peaked in Q3, it will take longer than expected to work through that. But overall, our focus is on managing our cash flow conversion cycle, taking it back down to a negative number, which is good for free cash flow and we're going to start doing so with our team immediately in Q4, and we'll keep it there for the upcoming quarters.\nAntonio Neri: So Wamsi, just a comment on the question around structural and units and the like. We have talked about this now for a number of years, I will say. And every generation that we introduced in the Compute business, call it Gen10, Gen10.5, soon Gen11, you see that, generally speaking, the rule of two-thirds, one-third stays through over time, right? Two-thirds is structural, meaning it's related to the number of options you can attach to the server platform, and that's driven by more memory and more storage and different class of storage because obviously, as you go to NVMe and then go NVMe over Fabrics and others, including SmartNIC, the content of the service becomes richer and richer and therefore, the content of Pointnext OS also becomes richer because now you have different quantities to support. So over time, when I look at the trends, it's still kind of the same two-thirds, one-third. And this business continue to be over $12 billion, no matter how you look at it. But I'm confident, as we go through here with GreenLake, the type of configuration becomes richer as well because the cloud experience that we built around it.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks for the question, Wamsi. Operator, I think we have time for one more, please.\nOperator: The last question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRod Hall: Hi guys. Thanks for the question. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess most of my questions have been answered. I thought maybe I would ask about financial services. That number has been down the last three quarters. Just curious, whether you guys are seeing anything within that from an origination point of view or anything else that might give us some hint as to what is going on with different -- various parts of that business. We know there are businesses outside of your own that are in there. For comparison, by the way, Dell said, they saw increased originations there because of what they're seeing in the broader macro. And I just wondered kind of whether you had any more color on that.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes, certainly. So yes, similarly to our competitors we're seeing originations or what we call financing volume up. It has increased 4% year-over-year. And this is driven by strong performance in GreenLake, but also whatever else we decide to finance in HPFS financial services. So the $13 billion lease portfolio is continuing to produce a substantial amount of profits and the profits come from two sources. One, it's a money-over-money business as all their financial services are, it's about spread and making sure that the spread is unaffected by rising interest rates. This continues unabated. And we also are seeing the second profitable driver of growth in HPFS, which is the fact that in this macroeconomic environment, customers tend to use their equipment for longer, which improves the realization of residual values. And so this is all ticking in the right direction. We're very pleased with this. And if you look back at the quality of the returns from HPFS, it's extremely high. Bad debt has returned to pre-COVID levels, which is remarkable. It shows the resilience of the portfolio and quality of the portfolio. And this is what stands behind a high return on equity of 19.5%, which is up 1.3 points from the prior year, and this is well above my long-term guidance for this business for an ROI of 18% plus and well above pre-pandemic levels. So very happy with the performance of HPFS.\nRod Hall: That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot, Tarek. Appreciate it.\nAndrew Simanek: Thanks, Rod, for the question. Antonio, maybe I'll turn it over to you for any final remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nAntonio Neri: Yes. I would just make one point on the last question, which is important that you understand as well. HPFS is very strategic when you pivot to as a service because as the business grows, you're going to manage a lot of assets. And fleet management is an essential component of the strategy. And that gives us a huge advantage when you have an asset life cycle management set of capabilities and scale, because in some cases, customers will say, ' Hey, I'm okay, we're using that solution, and we will have ability to deliver faster for our customers.' So I don't want to lose that point from a strategic perspective. Now just to closing, I know some of you have to go probably to the HPQ call, but I will wrap it up saying we had another solid quarter performance as we have done throughout 2022. I think our focus on the strategy, operational execution is absolutely delivering for shareholders, and that's reflected in our results and guidance. Our pipeline is incredibly strong and our backlog is now record breaking. And that gives us the confidence to deliver against our 2022 commitments and the guide that we just provided today. But what I'm really more pleased about is HPE is becoming more-and-more relevant to our customers because of our approach. And so we have crafted a unique, differentiated strategy that address, what I call, the data first modernization challenges and the opportunity we see in the market, and that's resonated with HPE GreenLake. So very confident in our ability to deliver what we discussed today, in Q4 and into 2023. And we have a very talented management team and 60,000 employees that really driven by this purpose to pivot the company and deliver for our shareholders. So thank you for your time, and we hope to see you at the Security Analyst Meeting in late October. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Well, great. Thank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. As we have demonstrated throughout 2022, HPE is delivering for our customers and our shareholders. In the third quarter, HPE grew revenues, increased profits and strengthened gross margins through steady operational focus and execution and despite continued tight supply conditions and unfavorable foreign exchange. In our results, you will see the customer demand for our industry leading portfolio. We continue to accelerate our recurrent revenue this fiscal year, which validates the compelling value proposition we offer our customers, and the long and the strong response to HPE GreenLake, our unified edge-to-cloud as-a-service platform. Customers continue to prioritize investments in IT. They find HPE's technology solutions to be particularly relevant in today's complex macroeconomic environment where technology innovation is critical to accelerate business transformation and deliver important business outcomes. In the third quarter, total HPE revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $7 billion, which was also above the sequential outlook we have given. New orders exceeded our expectations, despite finally starting to decelerate the growth rates, bringing our quarterly exit backlog to another record level. That is significant, considering that for the previous four consecutive quarters, we have grown orders 20% or more year-over-year. We continue to see robust customer demand in the market and a high-quality, durable sales pipeline. Our HPE GreenLake customer base is growing, and our customers are [voting] (ph) with their workloads and data. In Q3, we doubled HPE GreenLake new level of growth year-over-year, and our existing HPE GreenLake customers continue to renew and expand contracts with us. The HPE GreenLake platform has an exabyte of data under management and customers worldwide connect more than 2 million devices to it. The momentum is reflected on annualized revenue run rate up 28% and total as-a-service orders up 39% year-over-year, bringing our year-to-date orders growth to 86%. These indicators show enduring demand for our as-a-service solutions, even while supply constraints limited some installations. Once again, we expanded gross margins in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin of 34.7% was up 0.5 points sequentially and matched the highest we have ever generated since we began our as-a-service business in 2019. We improved non-GAAP operating margin even more than gross margin to 10.5% this quarter, up 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.48, a 9% sequential rise and 2% year-over-year. Our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion, and our free cash flow in the quarter was $587 million. This is in line with our typical seasonality as we improve cash conversion cycles in the second half. From a supply chain perspective, the dynamics remained largely unchanged from the last few quarters, with certain components still in tight supply, which limited shipments. However, we have made progress in proactive measures we have taken to enhance the resilience of our supply chain, including steering demand for products that do not require supply-constrained components, offering new multi-sourcing options and implementing [proper](ph) design changes to our world-class engineering capabilities. We could also see some easing in supply condition, if consumer demand continued to slow and component capacity shift towards enterprise customers. Overall, we expect supply chain to remain challenged, supply to remain challenged into next year, although with some very early signs of potential easing in the near term. We remain focused on translating customer demand into profitable revenue growth, as shown in our Q3 results. Customers continue to tell us that they need to drive their important digital transformation work while managing costs. And it is clear we commit those needs with our edge-to-cloud portfolio delivered through the HPE GreenLake platform. HPE GreenLake brings a unified hybrid cloud experience to our customers data and workloads enabling them to consume IT as utility. In June, I was thrilled to join 80,000 customers and partners, again, in person in Las Vegas at HPE Discover. We unveiled a series of new cloud services and enhancements for the HPE Connect platform to further advance the hybrid cloud experience for customers. We were particularly excited to announce HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise, which addresses customers' desire for their own automated, flexible enterprise-grade private cloud. We recognize the important role our partner ecosystem plays in our success and the success of our customers to continue to expand our growing partner ecosystem and enable them to adapt to customers' evolving requirements, we launched a new program that helps partners build their business on top of our HPE GreenLake platform. Customers are entrusting HPE GreenLake with their most critical workloads and applications. Japan card network, Japan's leading credit card payment network and an existing HPE GreenLake customer expanded its contract in Q3 to add a 100% for [Indiscernible] platform running on HPE NonStop servers, with an integrity -- with an integrated softwares. The new implementation will power the CARDNET systems demanding, transaction-intensive applications as Japanese consumers rapidly increase use of credit cards and cashless payments. In India, the country's largest public sector steel producer also expanded adoption of the HPE GreenLake platform to increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. By modernizing its critical S&P environment with HPE GreenLake, the organization can respond more quickly to business demand and help reduced its data center footprint by over 16% to help reach sustainability goals. These are just two examples of existing customers doubling down on HPE GreenLake platform to address new needs. We see this as an important endorsement of the valuable role HPE GreenLake plays in our customers' IT strategy. At the edge, we continue to drive innovation with our solutions. Aruba had an impressive quarter with revenue rising 12% year-over-year and orders increasing more than 15% for the seventh consecutive quarter. In Q3, Aruba announced new AIOps capabilities to reduce the time IT teams spent on manual tasks like network troubleshooting, performance tuning and security enforcement. These new AI basing sites leverage Aruba's industry-leading data lake from more than 120,000 Aruba users who are now on the HP Connect platform to enhance visibility, operations and the user experience. Our Edge technology was on display early this month as we created a secure network to power the Birmingham Commonwealth Games 2022 in the UK. Aruba provided the games network connecting thousands of staffs and volunteers and over 4,400 athletes across 20 venues and 38 concurrent events to ensure smooth execution of the games. Committed to leaving a legacy of digital sustainability in the region, HP is now working with the local organization to make the technology used for the event available to the community, including schools and hospitals. As data continues to grow and evolve rapidly, we are seeing customers use our technology to allow data in incredible ways. Catharina Hospital, one of the largest hospital and leading centers for heart diseases in the Netherlands is using HPE Ezmeral software to build a cloud native data lake house that security collects and analyzes anonymized patient data from internal and external sources. This will accelerate mobile training and tech anomalies among the 500,000 electrocardiograms already available for these analysis with higher precision to identify the correct diagnosis and treatment. And in one of the most exciting breakthroughs to showcase the power of AI at scale, earlier this month, I was pleased to visit the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to celebrate Frontier, the world's first fastest and greenest exascale supercomputer that HP built for the lab. Frontier represents a new area of scientific discovery and innovation that will strengthen US national security and industrial competition. HPE has a long history of industry first and one-of-a-kind innovation that advances societal progress. We see this as a part of our purpose to advance the way people live and work. We also delivered on our purpose through our commitment to create a more equitable and sustainable world. Early this summer, we took the bold step of accelerating our net zero carbon emission target by 10 years to 2040. Effective strategy to achieve net zero carbon emissions, are a cornerstone of corporate longevity, and we continue to help customers drive their own sustainable transformation. I'm proud of HPE's Q3 performance and the progress we are making to cement our position as the leading edge-to-cloud company. When I speak to customers, it is very rewarding to hear how they are using our differentiated portfolio to solve their most critical business problems. Every day, we are proving how essential HPE is to the customers and communities we serve. We couldn't do this without the dedication of our 60,000 team members who impress me every day with their bold innovation and disciplined execution. We have crafted a strategy at HPE that is winning in the marketplace, and I'm confident in our ability to execute on our commitments with strong demand, a solid pipeline and a unique edge-to-cloud offering that is delivering revenue growth and expanded gross margins and operating margins for our company. I look forward to updating you about our strategic priorities and outlook when we host our Security Analyst Meeting in late October. I hope you will join to hear how we plan to continue to generate value for HPE's shareholders. Let me now ask Tarek to discuss our performance in detail and go through our business segment results. Tarek, over to you. Sure. Thank you, Shannon, for the question. I may start, and then Tarek, please feel free to add your comments. I mean, I will say, this quarter, Shannon, was characterized, in my mind, by enduring customer demand. And you see what the backlog is now. I mean, it's a record level, more than 3x normal historical seasonality in some segments. It's just amazing to see the demand momentum, think about the Aruba 20 times historical levels and even Compute five times historical levels. So that's very pleasing. And I think it's a testament of our value proposition, because GreenLake is a pull-through platform for us across every aspect of our portfolio. As we said on the supply chain, the supply chain dynamics remain largely unchanged. But what has changed for us is that over the months and the quarter, we have taken actions to dual source or to steer demand in our products and then obviously implement design changes. I think because of our combination of our portfolio and customer segments, we believe we are very well positioned to move forward through this challenge as we go into next quarter and into 2023. But we expect supply to remain challenged as we get into 2023. That said, I mean, the fact of the matter is that we believe that, ultimately, we're going to see easing signs because of the -- of what we see in the consumer space and even in automotive and industrial, which are a conversation with the suppliers as they start thinking now how to balance that supplier substrate and then obviously, enterprise is well positioned. In terms of clearing the backlog, this is going to still take quite a bit of time, and that's a good news for us, because it gave us momentum in Q4 in 2023, which is great because remember, two things have happened in that backlog. Number one is price for a strong gross margin as Tarek just went through. So in many ways, it's protected for that gross margin. And number two, we have not seen any meaningful cancellation of all. One more thing, Shannon, is for you to also understand is that as we continue to grow the as-a-service component of this, the solutions for storage, compute, private clouds and the like are more standardized, which give us a better predictability on that front. So that will also help us move through this supply tight environment. I will admit a couple of things. First of all, year-over-year, you see a slight decline in OpEx as a percent of revenue, but that OpEx that we report, obviously, large maturities, R&D and FXD. But when you look at that OpEx as a productivity lever against our orders and what we have done, you can see with the backlog we have, we have improved our productivity particular on the sales force side. And then in R&D, to Tarek's point, we started this program in Q2 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic. In fact, I will say we were the first company to come out with a resource allocation and optimization program that allow us to manage cost in a discipline way that reposition resources in the areas of growth we want to drive going forward. And so Tarek also said, we will continue to see operating leverage as we convert the backlog and we scale that revenue, which obviously, we have a significant backlog. But as a percent of the order momentum, the productivity has significantly improved. I will say, Toni, just to add on that, we use the word steady, because, obviously, you can't use the word growth in the context of the compares here. But steady. Steady, and then within the steadiness, we have growth in some unique segments that continue. And Tarek talked about the Edge, we have a 20 times backlog in that business. And even on Compute, we still have 5 times. So -- and the other thing to remember here is that GreenLake is an accelerator of orders intake, because that creates us momentum in renewing and expanding and cross-selling across the business. So I think the original guidance we gave us at SAM last year, which was 2% to 4% over the long-term period, still absolutely true. And then when we get together at SAM here at the end of October, we're going to tell you what we're going to do specifically for 2023. But I sit here today and I feel pretty good about the momentum we have, because demand is steady, and our strategy is resonating with the pivot to as-a-service. Sure. Well, our as-a-service transformation through Edge-To-Cloud platform, GreenLake, is my number one priority and it's central to our strategy to bring that unified hybrid cloud experience that everybody is talking in the market. Ultimately, customers want to consume IT solutions in different ways. And this IT utility model is growing very, very rapidly. And I would argue, we were the first with our strategy. And so we have a little bit of head start here. And you see that in our order momentum, right, year-to-date. We grew the as-a-service bookings by 86%. And so clearly, that gives you the confidence that the 35% to 45% is absolutely achievable. But what it gives me more confidence, honestly, Tim, is the fact that, when I was at Discover just two months ago, and you look at the breadth of our solutions through the platform, and the experience that we provide, whether it's to deploy connectivity anywhere in your enterprise or where to deploy a private cloud that we came out with the new private cloud enterprise solutions, where you can run any type of workload, whether it's virtualized, containerized, or bare-metal, or whether to deploy data solutions to extract value from the data is growing. And that platform today has now more than an exabyte of data under management and 2 million devices under management as well. So our confidence to deliver the 35% to 45% is absolutely there. And remember that, at the last Security Analyst Meeting, we guided by the end of 2024 to have an ARR close to $2.3 billion, and we believe we are on track to do that. Tarek, do you have any comments on that? Yeah. Maybe I'll start and then I'll give it to Tarek. Thank you for the question. I mean, obviously, we are managing our -- the Compute business very different than our competition. And you see that in our operating margin performance, right, 13.3%, which is over 200 basis points year-over-year up. But we always guided you and the rest of the Street on an 11% to 13%. So we expect that over time to return to those levels, somewhere in that range. But at the same time, we continue to be incredible discipline in pricing. And that backlog that we have, which is now five times historical levels has been priced with that in mind, with that pricing discipline. And so that's why it gives us the confidence that as we go through the next handful of quarters here, we continue to see solid performance. But in the end, we will see, obviously, the balance between units and AUPs, because particularly, memory pricing will start taking effect. But at the same time, we are focusing also on profitable growth units in different segments of the market. And one strategy to do so is our GreenLake platform, because we are able to reach different customers with different configs with a margin that's more accretive, particularly because all the GreenLake's deals comes with the attach of Pointnext XOS. And one area you're going to see us also shifting is the software that comes with our compute platform, will be delivered also as a SaaS offering on the GreenLake platform as we have now entered or soon to be entered GEN-11. So, there is that dynamic of unit pricing and then offer configuration with us that we're going to drive through the next generation here. But that 11% to 13% is more reasonable in our mind. And clearly, we are doing so by managing our backlog and new orders intake. Tarek, do you have any comments on that? So Wamsi, just a comment on the question around structural and units and the like. We have talked about this now for a number of years, I will say. And every generation that we introduced in the Compute business, call it Gen10, Gen10.5, soon Gen11, you see that, generally speaking, the rule of two-thirds, one-third stays through over time, right? Two-thirds is structural, meaning it's related to the number of options you can attach to the server platform, and that's driven by more memory and more storage and different class of storage because obviously, as you go to NVMe and then go NVMe over Fabrics and others, including SmartNIC, the content of the service becomes richer and richer and therefore, the content of Pointnext OS also becomes richer because now you have different quantities to support. So over time, when I look at the trends, it's still kind of the same two-thirds, one-third. And this business continue to be over $12 billion, no matter how you look at it. But I'm confident, as we go through here with GreenLake, the type of configuration becomes richer as well because the cloud experience that we built around it."

            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slide 1. So, now let me discuss our Q3 performance details, starting with Slide 2. We continue to see healthy demand across our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio. As expected, year-over-year order growth rates moderated to down 9% this quarter as we begin to lap challenging compares. As a reminder, orders were up 29% year-over-year in Q3 of fiscal year 2021. We continued to grow our backlog sequentially this quarter to a new record level that is up 96% year-over-year. Our backlog is also expected to be roughly flat next quarter and remains firm with no meaningful cancellations. This maintains our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year 2022 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% growth adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 Securities Analyst Meeting. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $7 billion, up 4% year-over-year and above our outlook of up low-single-digits sequentially despite an ongoing challenging supply environment and greater currency headwinds. Based on current rates, we now expect currency to be a 2.5-point headwind to revenue for the full year as opposed to the 50 basis points expected at the start of our fiscal year. We continue to be very pleased with the resiliency and expansion of our non-GAAP gross margins, despite the inflationary environment and ongoing supply chain disruptions that are driving up material and logistics costs. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 34.7%, up 50 basis points sequentially and flat year-over-year, driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings. Non-GAAP operating margins were 10.5%, up 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year, reflecting operating leverage from strong gross margin and OpEx savings from our cost optimization actions taken during the pandemic. We expect to gain further operating leverage in the short term, as we drive more revenue growth and benefit from investments in the high-growth, margin rich areas of our portfolio. With our better-than-guided revenue growth, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.48, up 9% sequentially despite elevated input costs from the ongoing industry-wide supply constraints and foreign exchange impact. As previously indicated, cash flow from operations is following our normal seasonality this year, and working capital has also turned into a tailwind in the second half. In Q3, we generated $1.3 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $587 million. We continue to make further investments in strategic inventory to navigate the current supply environment, and we are now at peak inventory levels. We will begin to work our inventory balance down next quarter and into the following year, and I'll touch more on that shortly in our outlook. Finally, we continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $156 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October. We also repurchased $197 million in shares, on track towards our goal of at least $500 million of share buybacks executed this fiscal year and bringing our year-to-date total capital returns to $851 million, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation. Slide three highlights key metrics demonstrating our progress in our as-a-service business, with more recurring revenue at higher margins. Total as-a-service orders remained robust, up 39% year-over-year as we begin to lap more challenging compares. Our year-to-date as-a-service orders are up 86%, which is the best indicator of the long-term health of this business and supports our confidence in achieving our three-year ARR CAGR target of 35% to 45% from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024. Our ARR growth rate improved from last quarter and was up 28% year-over-year to $858 million, but still face supply constraints continuing to limit some installations. We also continue to expand our as-a-service margins as our mix of both software and services continues to increase to 64% in Q3, up 6 points year-over-year, with our expanding cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in Edge and Storage. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on slide four. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, we achieved both a record level of orders and revenue in the quarter. We grew orders double digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and have roughly 20 times our normal levels of backlog. Revenue growth accelerated to 12% year-over-year, outperforming the competition and demonstrating particular strength in Silver Peak, and our Edge-as-a-Service offerings, both up strong double digits. We delivered operating margins of 16.5%, up 390 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the improving operating leverage in this business and this despite higher component and logistics costs. In HPC and AI, revenue grew 15% year-over-year and backlog of awarded contracts remained robust at just under $3 billion. Our Q3 operating profit margin was 3.4%, up 9 points sequentially and is expected to increase further next quarter, with the recognition of large deals. In compute, demand remained robust with backlog growing sequentially to another record and is now at five times normal levels. Revenue was down 1%, reflecting a continued difficult supply environment with some improvement expected next quarter with new multi-sourcing options for certain components and demand steering towards new solutions. We also continue to be very focused on executing our dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistic costs and gives us a very high-quality backlog. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.3%, up 210 basis points year-over-year and still well above our long-term target set at SAM 2021 of 11% to 13%. Within Storage, we achieved another record level of backlog and revenue was up 1%. We continue to emphasize our own IP margin reach products that were up double digits, including nimble and hyper-converged. Our as a service offerings within storage like Block are also leading order and ARR growth among our business segments. With the favorable mix shift, our operating margins improved to 14.7%, up 210 basis points sequentially. With respect to Pointnext operational services, combined with storage services, orders grew again and are up year-to-date mid-single digits in constant currency, similar to levels for total fiscal year '21 despite the exit of our Russia business. As you know, this is a key component of recurring revenue and profits for each of our segments. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 4% year-over-year in constant currency with strong performance in GreenLake and revenue rose 1%. It's worth noting that our leasing business is well insulating from rising interest rates over time, as we price based on a spread and customers often choose to extend their leases during uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Our profitability also continues to benefit from higher residual value realization and bad debt write-offs have returned to pre-COVID levels. Our operating margin was 11.8%, up 70 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 19.5% remains well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance, where you can see our revenue and EPS continue to grow despite the difficult supply environment, the exit from our Russia business and increasing headwinds from currency. Year-to-date through Q3, we have already experienced a headwind of $0.05 from currency and $0.03 from exiting Russia. In spite of these headwinds, we delivered a better mix of higher-margin earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our edge to cloud strategy. This improvement can be seen on Slide 6, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q3 of 34.7%, up 50 basis points sequentially, and flat year-over-year, showing their resilience in spite of the increased component and logistics costs. This was driven by both our strategic pricing actions and the favorable mix shift we have been driving to edge on IP storage and our as a Service business. Moving to Slide 7. You can see our non-GAAP operating margins this quarter of 10.5%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 70 basis points year-over-year. This reflects revenue growth combined with both gross margin expansion and OpEx savings to give us strong operating leverage across the business. This has also been achieved while continuing to invest more in both R&D and our go-to-market in strategic areas of the business for future growth. On Slide 8, let's spend some time reminding everyone about the status of our unique setup in China through H3C. As disclosed in late April, we have extended our existing put option that is stuck at 15 times trailing 12-month earnings through to October 31, 2022. We did this to enable the new investors at the Unigroup level to complete their restructuring and are now determining the longer-term path forward for our stake. We value our presence in China, the second largest and fastest-growing IT market, although prior to the execution of any extension, we will balance the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk. H3C makes up a significant portion of our P&L and cash flow, and you can see that we are generating growing value to shareholders with our unique setup. Our equity interest rose 21% in fiscal year 2021 and has grown another 9% in this Q3. Needless to say, we will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer-term solution for this valuable asset. Turning to Slide 9. Our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion in Q3. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality and our expectations of working capital tailwinds in the second half. We have been strategically building inventory throughout this year to navigate the supply chain environment. While we still expect to start working down inventory levels in Q4, it will take longer than expected and into fiscal year 2023, but still puts us in a better position to convert the continued order demand into revenue and cash in future quarters. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 10. As discussed, Antonio and I are very pleased with the continued demand strength and growing backlog that gives us confidence in achieving our original SAM revenue guidance in fiscal year 2022 for growth of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency that now includes a 2.5-point headwind from foreign exchange rates on a full year basis. More specifically for Q4 2022, we expect revenue to be up at least 5% sequentially as reported, which includes the larger currency headwind. This is still above our normal seasonality to reflect some improvements in supply due to the full resumption of factories activity in China and our actions to multi-source, more components and steer the demand. From an EPS perspective, we are tightening our fiscal year 2022 non-GAAP outlook range as we move towards the end of the year to $1.96 to $2.04. This reflects the impact from the supply environment, which we expect to sustain into Q4, and further appreciation of the U.S. dollar since last quarter. As a result, this implies that for Q4 2022, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.32 to $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.52 to $0.60. Furthermore, our free cash flow is also being impacted by exiting our Russia business as well as headwinds from unfavorable currency movements that were previously absorbed in our prior outlook. As a result, we now expect to deliver fiscal year 2022 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. So overall, I am very pleased with our results in the quarter that can be characterized by sustained demand and very solid execution, navigated a continued challenging supply environment. With record levels of high-quality backlog, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing edge-to-cloud opportunity and close out a strong fiscal year 2022. We look forward to seeing you at our next Securities Analyst Meeting in October to provide our outlook for the fiscal year and beyond. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Yes. Shannon, if I can add on a couple of comments. What we're doing is we are engineering new solutions that are less dependent on components that are experiencing shortages. We're steering demand toward those solutions, and this is across every facet of our portfolio. We are also multi-sourcing the most constrained components, and this is helping working through the backlog. But as Antonio said, this will remain a challenged environment into next year. And that is actually for us an opportunity to continue to drive revenue with high-quality margins into fiscal year 2023. I do want to pick up on your point that you made very rightly about the guidance and having absorbed 200 basis points incremental in foreign exchange terms. This is a very important point. 200 extra basis points of headwind is about $580 million of revenue. You multiply this by the OP margin, and you can really look at what impact would that have had on EPS. So we are very pleased with the performance of our business. And the fact that in spite of substantial foreign exchange headwinds, we are able to maintain the revenue guide of 3% to 4% in constant currency, and therefore, our EPS guide as a result. So thanks for pointing that out. Of course, Meta. Thanks for asking the question. So FX is, obviously, a headwind to revenue because 55% of our revenue in the company is denominated in non-US dollar currencies. But it's -- as you point out, a tailwind to OpEx to some degree. Some of the cost that we incur is therefore lower on a dollar basis. Net-net FX is a headwind to operating profit and EPS. And so we started our cost containment in the middle of the pandemic, as you may recall, in April, May 2020. And we stay disciplined on OpEx moving forward. And this is shown to you by our gross and operating margin performance. We feel comfortable about our gross margin trend, and we believe per my script, that there is further opportunity to extract operating leverage in Q4 and beyond, thanks to the growth in high margin areas of our portfolio such as the edge. I feel pretty comfortable about the situation. If you look at our gross margins, to add more color, they're up 50 basis points sequentially and flat year-on-year. And this is in spite of an inflationary environment that would put a lot of pressure on supply chain, logistics costs and material costs, obviously, but also on labor costs. So on the whole, look for our margins and where they stand relative to those headwinds that we just discussed. Sure. So this -- it's a great question, Toni. So first and foremost, I want to point out to you that our -- we don't comment and give a specific figure on the backlog. But suffice is to say that it's close to double what it used to be last year this time of the year. That's the first point to take away, and we're working through it and its firm. There are no meaningful cancellations. So that's a tailwind to revenue generation, and we are executing better and better in our global operations team to convert that backlog into revenues. Orders are there. And they are there when you really look at segment by segment, we give you in our presentation, the detail of the order growth. So you can see the order growth in the Edge, for example, which has been on relentless, we've had seven quarters in a row of substantial order growth at the Edge in double digits. And the same holds true for other parts of our portfolio. The HPC, AI has its own dynamics with futures and a substantial order book north of $3 billion. So demand is not slowing to the point where this affects our fiscal year 2023 guide that we gave you at SAM last year, and we reiterated during the course of this year. We still see continuous demand. Even in Q3, the demand was sustained across the portfolio in Compute, in Storage, in HPC, AI at the Edge. It's probably lower than what it used to be four quarters ago for obvious reasons. These are tough compares. But the way to think about it is that the tide has come up. And maybe now the tide is a little bit catching its breath, but it's still there relative to where we were at the pandemic data point. I think you said very well, Antonio, we simply emphasize one thing strategically is, clearly, the word is now hybrid. Our customers have spoken, the market has spoken, the world is hybrid. For us to scale an as-a-service business in a hybrid world for any player to do so, you need to build a platform. Without the platform, you cannot scale, durably scale and take advantage of the hybrid world. And when you really look at what that means, it translates into higher margins in this business over time. The margins of this business are getting richer and richer as we add more services onto the platform and more software content onto the offerings. And we've made meaningful progress increasing our software and services mix by six point's year-over-year to the current level of about 64%. And we are targeting over 75% by fiscal year 2024 as we add more and more software content with storage data services such as Zerto, we add more softer content with networking services such as Silver Peak and new workloads. So we believe that our ARR is already well above corporate average gross margins, and we are driving it to even higher levels by adding more and more software, high-value content. Yeah. Okay. So let me try and break that down for you through the P&L, Amit. We're entering Q4 with, as Antonio said, enduring demand and a record backlog. And yes, there are still uncertainties in supply chain and the macroeconomic environment with FX. In spite of this, we believe we can grow revenue in -- by at least 5% on an as-reported basis. And this reflects above normal seasonality with some supply improvement, but we will still face also a greater currency impact. And so if you take that 5% revenue growth on an as-reported basis and you assume that gross margins will be down modestly quarter-over-quarter, you have to make that assumption because Compute margins will return to more historical ranges. You combine that with the fact that OpEx should be down modestly because of the measures we're taking and the pause we're putting on hiring and expenses that are discretionary in nature, or I&E will probably remain flat to slightly down quarter-on-quarter given the higher interest expense that we are seeing due to interest rates increasing. Tax rate will remain stable. You can assume a 14% effective tax rate as guided at SAM. You take all of that math of revenue, gross margin, OpEx or I&E and tax and you get to the guide that we gave you of $0.52 to $0.60 non-GAAP EPS for Q4 2022. Can I just add a little bit more color on the revenue AUP units dynamic here, right? So, I want to flag that our backlog consists of very healthy increases in both units and AUPs, right? The revenue in every quarter is more and more coming from the backlog. And specifically for Q3, regarding units and AUPs, units were down in high-teens because of supply chain tightness, but AUPs rose also in the high-teens because of richer configs. And the pricing actions that we've taken place. So, it remains a very dynamic business to watch for. Antonio flagged the need to monitor RAM prices, which we're doing on a daily basis. And we can be very quick at flipping our pricing strategy the other way should the market realign. But I think the longer-term trend that I would like you to focus on is the richer configs. These are the lead driver and the more structural driver of AUP increases rather than the pricing tools and measures that we can take. And we are very, very pleased overall with the way we're driving price margin units and mix in this compute business. And as Antonio pointed out, at 13.3% OP margins, this is by far the most profitable compute server business in the industry. Yes. So, it's hard to really parse out what is structural by way of configs and/or pricing related with respect to what drives our overall AUP in the compute business. And the reason for it is, our own actions. We have started to steer the demand towards new configs where we do have the supply and particularly the Gen10 plus servers are very successful in the market today. And these are, by definition, higher config relative to the Gen10. And so, I would say a large chunk of the success that we have there is driven by our own engineering and the steering of the demand to be able to fulfill the orders that we have in the backlog. And then specifically for cash flow, overall, at the company level, the dynamic that you all need to take into account is starting from the revenue growth that we flagged, which would be at least 5% on a revenue basis, reported basis, applying the margins commentary that we discussed, you're going to have a certain amount of cash earnings growth in Q4 sequentially relative to Q3. But the most important driver of free cash flow in Q4 is our cash flow conversion cycle. We already started to see in Q3 as foreshadowed the working capital becoming a tailwind. And in Q4, as we turn through our backlog, and we drive, therefore, higher revenues, we're also going to drive inventory levels down. And our overall cash conversion cycle will move from a positive 18 today to a negative figure, which is favorable to free cash flow generation in Q4. That's the key dynamic that I want you to take away as we work through the inventory, the inventory has peaked in Q3, it will take longer than expected to work through that. But overall, our focus is on managing our cash flow conversion cycle, taking it back down to a negative number, which is good for free cash flow and we're going to start doing so with our team immediately in Q4, and we'll keep it there for the upcoming quarters. Yes, certainly. So yes, similarly to our competitors we're seeing originations or what we call financing volume up. It has increased 4% year-over-year. And this is driven by strong performance in GreenLake, but also whatever else we decide to finance in HPFS financial services. So the $13 billion lease portfolio is continuing to produce a substantial amount of profits and the profits come from two sources. One, it's a money-over-money business as all their financial services are, it's about spread and making sure that the spread is unaffected by rising interest rates. This continues unabated. And we also are seeing the second profitable driver of growth in HPFS, which is the fact that in this macroeconomic environment, customers tend to use their equipment for longer, which improves the realization of residual values. And so this is all ticking in the right direction. We're very pleased with this. And if you look back at the quality of the returns from HPFS, it's extremely high. Bad debt has returned to pre-COVID levels, which is remarkable. It shows the resilience of the portfolio and quality of the portfolio. And this is what stands behind a high return on equity of 19.5%, which is up 1.3 points from the prior year, and this is well above my long-term guidance for this business for an ROI of 18% plus and well above pre-pandemic levels. So very happy with the performance of HPFS."

With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\nAntonio Neri: Well thank you, Andy and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining today's earnings call. HPE's second quarter results reflect significant customer traction for our differentiated portfolio and underscore our progress in becoming the edge-to-cloud company. The macroeconomic environment of the last few months has presented enterprises around the world with strategic challenges that are usually not confronted all at once. The market shifts have certainly created a dynamic backdrop for our global customers and have made it harder for them to realize their goals in the short-term. But more than ever, organizations need technology partners to help them weather challenges, while successfully digitizing and transforming their businesses in order to increase their market competitiveness. HPE's ability to address these customer needs was key to our performance in the second quarter. Once again, HPE generated significant orders growth, steady revenue, and sustained profitability, even as tight supply conditions continued across global industries. We are seeing persistent demand from our customers, underscoring both their IT spending prioritization and the attraction to our compelling portfolio. Very strong customer demand in the second quarter drove orders growth higher, rising 20% year-over-year, which makes this the fourth quarter in a row that HP has logged year-over-year orders growth of 20% or better. Our HPE GreenLake H2 Cloud platform contributed to as-a-service orders doubling year-over-year, the third straight quarter of triple-digit growth. We continue to see a great deal of customer interest in our platform, which is evident in our sales pipeline. Our orders backlog across the business is high quality, and we are now -- we are seeing particular strength in our Intelligent Edge and Compute segments, with orders climbing 45% and 23%, respectively. HPC and AI orders grew more than 18%, bringing backlog there to an impressive record of approximately $3 billion. Total HPE revenue rose 1.5% year-over-year to $6.7 billion against a record break in backlog of orders in the midst of industry supply constraints. ARR climbed 25%. We have momentum across the portfolio with our as-a-service model differentiating us. This quarter, though, through a combination of supply constraints, limiting our ability to fulfill orders as well as some areas where we could have executed better, we did not fully translated the strong customer orders into higher revenue growth. I am confident that we have identified where we can strengthen and expect continued improvement as we move into the back half of the year. Importantly, the quarter's biggest standout, even if we were somewhat limited by supply chain, is that we maintained non-GAAP gross margins of 34%, thanks to disciplined execution and timely pricing actions. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.44, which together with our Q1 results, makes the first half of 2022, the second strongest EPS half year performance at HPE on a continuing operations basis. As Tarek will detail for you, we are reaffirming our full year outlook of revenue growth of 3% to 4% and our long-term 2024 revenue CAGR outlook. We are also reaffirming our full fiscal year free cash flow guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As announced in February, we suspended all shipments to and sales in Russia and Belarus. We have now determined that it's no longer tenable for us to maintain operations in these countries. Therefore, today, we are announcing the closing of our operations in both countries and we'll proceed with an orderly managed exit. Our business in these countries represents less than 2% of HPE's total revenue in fiscal year 2021. We have booked $126 million pre-tax charge related to the impact of Russia to our business, which is included in our second quarter GAAP earnings per share results. We expect less significant additional charges in the third quarter related to winding down these operations, partially to reflect this necessary action and partially to unfavorable foreign exchange movement, we are updating our full fiscal year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to between $1.96 to $2.10, which is the guidance we provided at our Securities Analyst Meeting last October. In the short term, we recognize the supply and logistics constraints, rising inflation and evolving economic and geopolitical conditions are all contributing to a dynamic environment. However, enterprise demand continues to persist across our entire portfolio. We are focused on translating the demand we see in the market and a high-quality backlog into profitable growth, while continuing to closely manage our inventory position. When even the supply of low-value components can be hard to secure in today's environment, we will continue to be disciplined and prudent in our decision-making to deliver on our commitments. As we look to the future, we are strengthening the scale and resilience of our supply chain, including opening a new factory in the Czech Republic for next-generation HPC and AI technologies, which will help us address the very solid demand we have for these specialized solutions. There is no question that we have positioned HPE well to help our customers double down on digital transformation. HPE GreenLake is at the center of our strategy to deliver edge to cloud solutions to enable customers data first modernization strategies. I hope many of you will join us later this month to see firsthand how our strategy comes to life when we host HPE Discover live in Las Vegas for the first time in three years. We will have a lot to show you as it has been an exciting few months for our customers and for HPE. In March, we announced features on HPE GreenLake that deliver greater choice and simplicity. We added 12 new cloud native services with now more than the total of 50 cloud new services available through the platform. We also continue to expand our partner ecosystem, increasing the number of partners actively selling HP GreenLake this quarter by more than 50% from the same period last year. In addition, partners who sold multiple HPE GreenLake deals in the quarter increased by 2.5 times year-over-year. At the edge, our capabilities are high demand as organizations need to securely connect distributed workforces and create engaging experiences. We are focused on delivering cloud-native services that can more easily embed intra automated networks to absorb evolving networking configurations. And with the convergence of Aruba Central and HPE GreenLake, more than 120,000 Aruba customers now have access to the HPE GreenLake platform. As customers adopt hybrid multi-class solutions, we know they also need a secure and flexible on-premises cloud solution. We were recently selected as the prime provider for Google's cloud distributed hosted solution. HPE GreenLake will enable Google to deliver an on-premises cloud experience for organization with strict data residency, security, and privacy requirements. Our hybrid cloud offerings have attracted nearly 150 new customers in Q2, including BMW Group, who is using HPE GreenLake to streamline and unify the company's data management across its global locations in the cloud and Worldline, the world's fourth largest provider who chose HPE GreenLake to implement their major performance upgrade to its payment platform as it continues to deliver against a cashless economy vision. HPE Financial Services had a unique hand in the Worldline upgrade to HPE GreenLake, with our asset renewal program funding approximately 25% of the refresh. From a data perspective, we continue to make meaningful enhancement that allow customers to extract more insights from their data to accelerate business outcomes. For instance, we are creating sophisticated AI models to generate and share insights in distributed environments. In April, we introduced HPE Swarm Learning, which enables users to share learnings through an AI model at the edge and from distinct sites without compromising data privacy. One university in Germany is already using in HPE Swarm Learning to more accurately diagnose colon cancer by applying AI learnings that can predict cancerous genetic alterations. And early this week, Frontier, an HPE designed and built system became the world's first and the fastest exascale supercomputer, taking the number one ranking on the world's top 500 list of supercomputers, exceeding the 1 exaflop performance threshold for the first time. To put this in perspective, this performance is three time faster than the number two super computer. HP has deployed four of the top 10 supercomputers and ranked first, second, third and fourth, on the Green 500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. Our service pivot is also innovative in the way it helps our customers meet their sustainability goals. HPE Relay helped customers reduce their carbon footprint by more than 30% versus traditional IT models. Later this month, when we release our Living Progress Report, we will share more about our efforts to support our customers' goals, while pushing ourselves in the industry to improve our own. Few of us could have predicted that the challenges of the last several years would require enterprises to adopt so dramatically. I spent at least 50% of my time with customers around the world, and I can tell you that when they think about how they are going to reimagine their futures, they see HPE as an even more relevant innovation partner than ever before. As I reflect on Q2 and look ahead to the future, I am confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments. We have the right strategy to capitalize on market trends, with an expansive edge-to-cloud portfolio that's connected through our market-leading HPE GreenLake platform. We have significant momentum with our customers. And perhaps most importantly, we have been -- we have a truly stellar team. I am proud of the 60,000 team members who make our results possible and who help us deliver on our purpose as a company. This team will continue to innovate and execute in ways that will further set us apart and continue to create value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to walk you through the details of our business segment results and overall performance.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slide 1 and 2. So now let me discuss our Q2 performance details, starting with Slide 3. We continue to see robust demand across our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio with order growth up 20% year-over-year, the same as last quarter. This marks our fourth quarter in a row with order growth of 20% or better year-over-year. This maintains our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year 2022 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% growth adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 Securities Analyst Meeting. We delivered Q2 revenues of $6.7 billion, up 1.5% year-over-year and in line with our outlook of normal sequential seasonality and despite a more challenging supply environment that limited upside. The unexpected COVID-related shutdowns in China and seizing the support of Russia services contracts impacted our revenue by more than $250 million in the quarter, our total operating margins by more than one point and EPS by approximately $0.06. Given the delta between our order and revenue growth rates, our backlog further increased to new record levels and yet remains very high quality. The order book is firm and most importantly, has been priced to preserve gross margins. We are particularly pleased with the resiliency of our non-GAAP gross margins despite the inflationary environment and ongoing supply chain disruptions that are driving up material and logistics costs. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 34.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially and down just 10 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings. Non-GAAP operating margins were 9.3%, reflecting the revenue impact from incremental supply constraints and our exit from Russia that reduced operating leverage. We expect operating margins to expand in the short term as we drive more leverage from revenue growth and benefit from investments in the high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio. Within other income and expense, we benefited from robust operational performance in H3C and further gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder investment portfolio. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP other income and expense for fiscal year 2022 to be an income of approximately $75 million versus prior guidance of an approximately $25 million income. Given our strength in gross margin and despite the approximately $0.06 impact from China and Russia, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44, near the midpoint of our outlook range of $0.41 to $0.49 for Q2. We also delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.19. This includes $126 million of disaster charges related to Russia, primarily consisting of an increased reserve for financing lease assets. With the decision to already exit Russia that we have announced today, we expect to record and less significant GAAP-only charge in Q3 that has been factored into our updated outlook already. As previously indicated, we expected free cash flow to be in line with our normal seasonality that is a use of cash in the first half and Q2 was a use of cash of $211 million. We have made significant investments in working capital during the first half, reflecting our strategic inventory actions to navigate the current supply environment. This will better position us to convert orders into future revenue and cash flow, while working capital is expected to become a tailwind in the second half. Finally, we continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $156 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in July. We also repurchased $58 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total capital returns to $498 million, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation. Slide four highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. We continue to see very strong momentum across our as-a-service portfolio, where we introduced 12 new cloud services this quarter and converge Aruba Central with the HPE GreenLake platform to create a unified operational experience for all users. Total as-a-service orders were up 107% year-over-year, marking the third quarter in a row with orders more than doubling. Our ARR was up 25% year-over-year to $829 million, with supply constraints continuing to limit some installations. While our ARR growth is somewhat volatile in the current supply environment, the strong order growth over the last several quarters is the best indicator of the long-term health of this business. This gives us confidence in delivering our 35% to 45% CAGR target from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024, with increasing margins as our mix of both software and services continues to increase to 64% in Q2, up more than 5 points year-over-year with our expanding cloud and SaaS offerings. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 5. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, demand for our secure connectivity solutions accelerated with orders growing 45% year-over-year, the fifth consecutive quarter with growth of more than 35%. Despite increased supply disruptions in China, revenue grew 9% year-over-year, outperforming the competition and demonstrating particular strength in Silver Peak and our Edge-as-a-Service offerings, both up strong double-digits. We delivered operating margins of 12.6%, reflecting higher component and logistics costs, resulting in lower operating leverage. We expect margins to improve next quarter with higher levels of revenue that also benefit from previous price actions that are sticking. In HPC and AI, demand remains robust with order growth of 18% year-over-year, driving our awarded contracts total to another record level of just under $3 billion. Revenue grew 5% year-over-year and was impacted by one large customer acceptance delay that impacted growth by more than six points and has now been delivered in Q3.  Importantly, our Q2 operating profit was impacted by the ramp in project costs for a couple of mega deals expected to close by the end of the year that will return operating margins to more in range with historical levels. In Compute, order growth remained robust and was up over 20% year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, while revenue growth was up 1%, reflecting a more difficult supply environment. We continue to be very focused on executing a dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistics cost and gives us a very high-quality backlog. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.9%, up 270 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially, well above our long-term target set at SAM 2021 of 11% to 13%. Within Storage, we achieved another record level of product backlog that is skewed towards our owned IP margin-rich products. Revenue was down 2%, reflecting supply constraints for our own IP products. As a result, we continue to have unfavorable revenue mix that pressured our margins this quarter. We expect both our revenue growth rates and margins to improve over the next few quarters as we work through our favorable backlog mix and steer more demand towards our new Electra  and Block Storage offerings. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including storage services, orders again grew mid-single digits year-over-year as reported, similar to levels for total fiscal year 2021. As you know, this is very important for the long-term health of our most profitable business. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 2% year-over-year with strong performance in GreenLake and revenue was flat. Our profitability continues to benefit from higher residual value realization as customers tend to extend the use of their systems in a supply-constrained environment. Our operating margin was 12.6%, up 180 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 20.4% remains well above the 18%-plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide six highlights our revenue and EPS performance where you can see we've maintained relatively constant levels from last year despite incremental supply constraints, in particular, from the China shutdowns and also are seizing to support services contracts in Russia. As a reminder, this combines for more than a $250 million impact to revenue and a one point impact to total operating margins and an approximately $0.06 impact to EPS in Q2. In spite of these headwinds, we delivered a better quality of earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our Edge to Cloud strategy. The improved quality of earnings can be seen on slide seven, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q2 of 34.2% showing their resilience in spite of the increased component and logistics costs. This was driven by both our strategic pricing actions and the favorable mix shift we've been driving towards edge and our as-a-service business. Moving to slide eight, you can see our non-GAAP operating margin this quarter of 9.3%, reflecting the reduced operating leverage from supply challenges and our exit from Russia. However, we are achieving much better efficiency in our sales and office investments when measuring productivity on an orders basis. Given our high-quality backlog, we are also continuing to invest more in both R&D and our go-to-market for future growth. On slide nine, let's spend some time reminding everyone about our unique setup in China through H3C. As disclosed in an 8-K in late April, we have extended our existing food option that is struck at 15 times trading 12-month earnings through to October 31st, 2022. We did this to enable the new investors at the Unigroup level to complete their restructuring, which is proceeding as planned before determining a longer term path forward for our stake. We value our presence in China, the second largest and fastest-growing IT market, although we will balance prior to execution of any extension, the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk. H3C makes up a significant portion of our P&L and cash flow and you can see that we are generating growing value to shareholders with our unique setup. Our equity interest rose 21% in fiscal year 2021 and has grown 32% in this Q2 of fiscal year 2022. We will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer term solution for this valuable asset. Turning to slide 10, our free cash flow was a use of cash of $211 million. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality with the first half being a use of cash followed by strong generation of free cash flow in the second half. The first half of this year has also been uniquely impacted by the supply chain environment as we strategically built inventory levels in Q1 that were flat in Q2. We are taking further strategic actions to improve supply chain visibility and attain operational and financial benefits. This will put us in a better position to begin converting orders and generate healthy amounts of cash as working capital will turn into a tailwind in the back half of the year. We will need to demonstrate strong execution in the second half, but we have a path forward and expect to deliver fiscal year 2022 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 11. We are revising our fiscal year 2022 non-GAAP outlook range back to our original outlook provided at SAM of $1.96 to $2.10. This reflects the impacts of a more unfavorable currency movements since last October, the exit of the business in Russia, the COVID-related disruptions in China to this date, offset by the other income and expense benefit we've received in the first half. From a top line perspective, we are very pleased with the continued strength in orders and growing backlog that gives us confidence in future revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. We do want to remain prudent in the short term, given the ongoing supply challenges that we believe will likely last well into next year. Currency is also expected to now be a two-point headwind to revenue for the full year as opposed to the 50 basis points at the start of our fiscal year. As a result, we still have strong confidence in our fiscal year 2022 revenue growth outlook of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency and expect to end the year with elevated levels of backlog, which bodes well for fiscal year 2023. More specifically, for Q3 2022, we expect revenue to be up low single-digits sequentially. This is slightly below our normal seasonality to reflect our expectations that the China shutdowns will have a lingering impact in the short term. As a result, for Q3 2022, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.22 to $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.54. So overall, I'm pleased with how we are executing in a strong demand but challenging supply environment during the first half of fiscal year 2022. With our high-quality backlog, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing Edge to Cloud opportunity and deliver against all of our financial commitments set at SAM 2021. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And the first question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Sorry about that, guys. Can you hear me?\nTarek Robbiati: Yes, we can Aaron.\nAntonio Neri: We can.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. Yes, sorry. Sorry about that. So I'll start with just the question on the backlog. As you kind of thought about the guidance for the full year and obviously, some moving parts around FX and China, et cetera, but how has your assumptions changed at all with regard to the backlog build? Are you assuming any kind of backlog reduction through the course of this fiscal year? And if not, what's your current views on kind of peaking levels of backlog at this point? Thank you. \nTarek Robbiati: Yes, good afternoon Charles, thank you for the -- Aaron, good afternoon for the question -- thank you for the question with regard to our backlog. I would say our backlog has not peaked yet. When you have four consecutive quarters of 20% growth and the delta between the backlog growth, order growth and the revenue being what it is, the backlog has not peaked and will probably peak towards the end of this fiscal year. Our assumptions on converting that backlog into revenue are contained in the guidance that we gave for this fiscal year of 3% to 4% revenue growth adjusted for currency. I want to reiterate to you that the FX impact in that guidance is a 2% headwind as opposed to a 50 basis point headwind that we originally forecast.\nAntonio Neri: I would say, Aaron, obviously, we're going to enter 2023 with an elevated backlog, which bodes us well for the future revenue growth of the company. As I said in my remarks, we continue to be very confident in our CAGR outlook that we provided at SAM for the next three years. But obviously, as we go forward, the backlog will be reduced supply and other issues alleviates. And if you think about the 3% to 4% guidance for the year, which is the guidance we provide at SAM versus the 1.5% we just reported, obviously, there will be low single-digit growth sequentially on that revenue.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks for the question, Aaron. Chuck, can we go to the next one, please?\nOperator: Yes sir. The next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could help me get a little bit better insight into what allowed you to basically do better on gross margin than we expected given the input costs and the foreign exchange. What I'm looking for in this question is an understanding of how much of this is about mix? How much of it is about your ability to raise prices and pass that on to customers? And how are you thinking about the outlook for the gross margin given what you've done so far in terms of price increases and what you're thinking about on foreign exchange? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Sure. So, let me try and unpack this for you. So, first of all, when you really look at our business across the various segments, Aruba is continuing to do extremely well and we outperformed the competition, specifically Cisco in the second quarter. And the order book in Aruba is absolutely substantial. As you can observe, Aruba growth -- and you know Aruba comes with higher gross margin, has a favorable impact on the mix. The second thing I would point out to you is with respect to compute, the disciplined pricing actions that we've taken now for several quarters with compute continue to bear fruit. Compute operating profit margins at well above 13%, well above our long-term guidance, have also been better than what our main competitor in that space, Dell, has delivered for their total ISG margins that include compute, storage, and networking. So, compute is performing much, much better than the rest of the industry. Third, when you really look at the gross margin mix again across the other segments, particularly Storage and HPC, there are two different stories there. With respect to storage, you have a mix between our own IP product and third-party product that has been unfavorable to us, meaning that there were more third-party product revenues and on IP revenue. And you can see, therefore, that this has had a detrimental impact to gross margins for storage. Finally, HPC, the story there is a story that is we've always been saying, it's a lumpy business, and it's a matter of revenue scale. We had one slippage of a deal that has affected growth by six points in the quarter. That deal has closed into Q3. And really, the fundamental question for HPC is the delivery of substantial mega deals that we have planned for the second half. And so if you take all of this into account and you look at overall gross margins for the company, the story is different by segment. But it is the result of a number of actions that we have taken in Aruba and in Compute, offset by product mix shift in storage and revenue delays in HPC. On the whole, very pleased to have our gross margins where they are at 34.2%, up sequentially and better than last year. And finally, let me add to this, the performance of HPFS. The performance of HPFS is outstanding. You can see that while there is not much revenue growth. And this is not a gross margin business, it's a business that delivers substantial amounts of profit by way of operating profit margins. And the return on equity there in HPFS is very, very strong, north of 20%, which is better than our long-term outlook of 18-plus percent that we gave you at SAM 2021. So I hope this gave you color and I up back things f or you the way you want it, Simon. But if not, we're welcome to take the conversation offline with you again.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you. I\u2019ll hop offline.\nAntonio Neri: Thanks, Simon. Appreciate it. Operator, can we have the next one please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask more on the demand side here and you had another quarter of strong orders, maybe if you can give us a bit more color on what you're seeing on a geographic basis, particularly, I think investors have been concerned about the momentum in enterprise in Europe and ex-Russia, if you can give any color on what you're seeing in that region? And also, I don't know if you sort of pointed out what the order impact on the order number was from the Russia exit as well? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thank you. Thank you for the question. As I said in my remarks, we continue to see ongoing persistent demand from our customers. I think it's a combination of them prioritizing IT spend. And honestly, the attraction to our portfolio. We have a very comprehensive portfolio from Edge to Cloud that is resonate in the market. And Tarek just talked a little bit about the strength of the Edge, which grew now in excess of 40% for four consecutive quarters. That's simply remarkable. And yet, we just delivered 9% revenue growth. So that tells you the strength of the demand. As you think about this distributor enterprise, there's just new way to work. I think the other area, obviously, as customers continue to assess their hybrid multi-cloud journeys, which is now here to stay. They see HPE GreenLake as a very solid alternative to what I call flexibility, choice and control. And the fact that one of the major clouds is leveraging HPE GreenLake to basically deliver their managed hosted distributor cloud, is a testament of that differentiation. The other thing, obviously, anything related to data is simply very strong. I think the demand for big data, analytics, AI, machine learning will continue to grow. And that's because customers need to extract insights from the data, which I think is the most valuable thing they have. Obviously, cybersecurity, Aruba with our SD-WAN and our SASE approach also provides an alternative to that. So, I think as I look forward, I personally believe and being at the World Economic Forum for the last week and listening, I think the potential slowdown is more a consumer issue more than an enterprise issue. And the reason why I said that is because every customer we talk to, they are prioritizing digitizing their businesses, modernizing their businesses, deploying cloud as an experience in this multi-cloud approach because it's all about speed and agility, and obviously, as I said before, extract every bit of insight from the data. And that's our strategy against the trends we see with HPE GreenLake, which is a data first modernization approach. Our demand is super strong, 20%, four consecutive quarters for HPE is pretty remarkable and our order backlog, as we said early on, is high quality, which means it's order -- the order book is firm. We don't see any major cancellation that will concern us at all. And last but not least, to Tarek's point, we priced the backlog to preserve gross margins. And that's what gives us the confidence not only to grow revenue, but continue to deliver our operating margin commitments and ultimately EPS commitments. The impact of Russia is -- and Belarus because you have to combine these two, is less than 2% of the revenue on a continuous basis. If you look at 2021, in terms of EPS, Tarek explained it and unpacked it for you, which we were able to kind of offset in many ways with overperformance in Q1. So, Tarek, any comments you want to say?\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. So, let me add on the last part of your question. So, the impact from Russia on orders was negligible. This was not something that has affected our orders. China and Russia together, obviously, with Belarus, impacted our revenue by $250 million, the majority of that impact relates to China. And the Russia impact specifically is related to the fact that we cannot operate any more in the country and serve existing customers with our services contracts, and therefore, this has been factored into the impact. I've described that totals for China and Russia, 1% impact on total operating profit margins and $0.06 on EPS overall. But again, the majority of these impacts were driven by the China disruptions on the supply side of the equation. And yes, I agree with Antonio on the -- totally agree on the resiliency of the demand. I simply want to add the fact that even though there could be a slowdown in the EU, the European governments are ramping up a number of initiatives that are all in our favor in the digital space, which gives us confidence for the medium to long-term.\nAntonio Neri: And I will say, our diversification of our coverage around the globe also is a good positive thing for us.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks for that Samik. Can we get the next one please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. I hear your comments about the confidence around the demand trajectory and that orders continue to be very strong. But as you look into the second half, can you talk about how those demand trends are breaking out across regions, if you're seeing any variability from 90 days ago? And you also sort of maintained your free cash flow guide, but EPS, you alluded to some of these impacts, the $0.06 that you alluded to, Tarek, but you're maintaining your free cash flow. What are some of the offsets that are allowing you to do that? And when you look at the second half free cash flow that needs to come in extremely strong, so can you talk about what levers we should expect within those free cash flow moving pieces that get you to your guide across the second half? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Let me start and I would like Tarek to talk about the free cash flow, Wamsi. Listen, so far, so far, and I can only talk so far, I have not seen any major deviation from 90 days ago on demand, continue to be very strong. And that's why we use the word persistent. Persistent meaning is there, right? And then I think it depends on what happens here in the back half of the year with some of the other policies, Tarek mentioned some of them in Europe. But obviously, as we think about inflation, interest rates and whatnot, that may or may not have an impact. But as I said earlier, Wamsi, I think it's mostly on the consumer side and the enterprise side. If anything, I will argue, it will have a positive impact to our GreenLake because customers want to maybe preserve some CapEx and then would use more of the as-a-service model. And still, deal with the reality that this is a hybrid multi-cloud journey, and therefore, for those award loads and data that cannot move outside their premises or a colocation or even moving from the edge for that matter, GreenLake is perfectly suited for that. And that's why it's a combination of our solutions, now 50-plus cloud native services, the fact that Google is going to use our solution is a very strong endorsement. But I think we are positioned to capture either way. And I think our backlog gives us a very strong foundation to build from there as we look forward. Tarek, you want to talk about the free cash flow question?\nTarek Robbiati: Yes, sure. So first Wamsi, if you want a rough rule of thumb when you're looking at EPS changes and how these EPS dollars translate or sense translates into free cash flow, every cent of EPS is essentially $13 million to $15 million, right? So when you look at the lowering of our guidance is very much contained in the guidance we gave at the free cash flow level. So the lowering of our guidance back to the SAM 2021 guide is very much contained in the free cash flow guide that we gave you. And the reason why we gave you this free cash flow guide was because of the working capital assumptions that we had made at the beginning of our fiscal year. So I feel comfortable that we are within the free cash flow guide. Now the second part of your question is what makes you confident that in the second half, you can generate this quantity of free cash flow given where you are at the end of the first half. I would simply say to you that we expect, first and foremost, working capital to become a tailwind in the second half as opposed to the first, where it was a headwind because of the inventory actions that we've taken. And by the way, we've done this before. In fiscal year 2019, I want to remind everybody, we generated in the first half, $200 million of free cash flow and in the second half, we generated $2.2 billion. So, more than -- 10 times more than what we generated in the first half. This was offset by $666 million that we had to pay for an arbitration case that we lost at the time in fiscal year 2019. And we had very little time to turn around and offset the impact of that arbitration case, and yet we came into our guide that we gave at the time. And really look also at the trends on operating free cash flow that we highlighted to you as part of this call, you will observe that our seasonality is very much in line with fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020. Fiscal year 2021 was a different story because in fiscal year 2021, you add the impact of restructuring costs that were affecting free cash flow. And if you will observe the detail of our press release with the tables that we provided you, you will see that our restructuring costs are coming down overall relative to fiscal year 2021. So, lots of puts and takes there, but we are happy to reaffirm the free cash flow guide of $1.8 billion to $2 billion.\nAntonio Neri: This way -- one thing for me to say is that we are exactly what we were at the October Security Analyst Meeting, where we guided 3% to 4% revenue growth; the EPS guidance we just provided today, which is $1.96 to $2.10; and a free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. And knowing the seasonality of our business, we say at the time this year will be a normal seasonality business as you take the two years of COVID out of the way, we are very confident to deliver that number. It's exactly what Tarek said, it's the working capital is going to turn favorable to us. And as we continue to drive the backlog down over time, that will help us as well. So, the earning correlation to free cash flow is the same we provided as one. And in terms of restructuring, just to be clear on that one, we are very pleased with the progress we've made, which obviously was there, we refer to the time reallocating resources to the areas of growth, you can see the areas of growth being HPC, AI, edge, and GreenLake, obviously, which are paying off to us and on track to deliver the $800 million net savings that we committed at the time.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. Appreciate it. Can we go to the next one please, Chuck?\nOperator: Yes. The next question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRod Hall: Yes, hi guys. thanks for the question. I guess in the ongoing spirit of trying to make sense of an incredibly complicated supply situation, I wanted to come back and kind of maybe juxtapose your performance here against a couple of other companies. So, if I look at Cisco, they, I would say, objectively performed quite a bit worse on supply than you guys did. You had some sort of a middle of the road impact, not too bad of an impact from what I can tell in the numbers. And then if I look at Dell, they had almost no impact. Although Dell did call out some looking forward issues with server supply. So, I just wonder if you could dig into that a little bit for us and kind of help us understand some of the puts and takes around supply, maybe why those differences of performance emerged? And then I have a follow-up.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. I'm going to start. But I think -- I don't think you can look quarter-by-quarter. Honestly, you have to look at the half and then in the second half. If you look at our performance in Q1, we did very well. And on the balance, I think we are pleased with the first half. Listen, and then there is a lot of puts and takes here because factory locations plays a role. So sometime you're in the right side of the location, sometimes you're not. And obviously, for us, the impact of Shenzhen and Shanghai was there in April, and Tarek quantified that for you, that impacted not just the compute business, every line of business because other products come from that side. Some of our vendors did not have the same impact. So that\u2019s why it's important. The other one is that you make strategic choices about components two to three years ago. And those -- there are some suppliers more impacted than other ones. And therefore, you need to go into the details of the product itself and configurations and whatnot. And last but not least, when you look at our performance, let's remind ourselves, we have a unique setup in China. And that set up basically says we cannot consolidate the China revenue that our partner today delivers. And when you look at the China growth, I can tell you, our H3C business is performing exceptionally well in China. However, the only thing we recognize on that is the dividend that we collect, but not the revenue. And then when you look at the segment, call it, the server category, it is compute plus HPC plus H3C, as the way market share gets reported. So that's why I look at this from a half performance. We made it better in Q1, maybe a little bit less so in Q2. Again, some of our competitors, namely Dell, as you said, on some aspects. But on a balance, not that far off, again, Cisco definitely we did well on every metric you want to look at it. And -- but in the end, we are focused on the full year to deliver that guidance of 3% to 4% and obviously exit the year with still quite a large backlog, which bodes well for 2023.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. I want to add also, Rod, that the -- in what you said, it's really important to look at what happens at the bottom line and at the margin level. And when you really look at how we've outperformed Dell on the margin level, Q1 and Q2, considering it simply the compute margins alone compared to the ISG margins is very telling.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. I think on that note, I mean, delivering 13.9% on what people refer as a commoditized business compared to 10.2%, which includes server storage and networking, I think it's pretty remarkable. But I think also shows our strategy to drive profitable revenue growth, not just revenue for the sake of revenue.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay, guys. So I am going to leave it there. Thank you very much for the answers.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. Thanks, Rod. Next question, please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. So the large delta between your orders growth and revenue trajectory suggests that there still remains a large amount of unfulfilled demand. Given this dynamic, do you envision a scenario where customers begin to perhaps rearchitect their infrastructure so that a larger mix of their IT workloads whether that's compute, storage, networking, HPC are delivered via cloud native GreenLake as-a-service models?\nAntonio Neri: That's a great question. We see that more and more. Obviously, I think what customers are battling is the fact they are going through a multigenerational IT journey here. That they have to modernize. The fact that data has gravity and obviously, some industry are more regulated than others. Then you talk about latency and experience that really matters. Cost, obviously, is another big component because at scale, they need to comprehend the cost aspect of it. And GreenLake is an amazing platform we have developed over the years to give them access, flexibility, and control against all the needs. In a way, they are moving away from running IT to more innovating on IT and that's why this data-first modernization approach is so relevant. And that's why we already have more than $6 billion in the balance sheet related to the HPE GreenLake business, which again grew 107% in Q2. And obviously, that -- those bookings eventually will unwind from the balance sheet and through the P&L. And the other important fact here that Tarek show in one of his slides, is the fact that our mix of GreenLake is shifting every single quarter to more software and services, which obviously comes with a significant higher margin than just the hardware. So, that's why I think about the order momentum is super strong, the marquee type of customers across events is super strong. The fact that we keep adding capabilities, the mix is shifting and that's totally accretive to our gross margin as we go forward. And this is one of the key moments of our company, transforming into a relevant platform that customers can use as they go through this journey that we just -- that you just highlighted.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks, Irvin, for the question. Operator, let's go to the last one, please.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKyle McNealy: Hi, thanks very much for the question. Can you give us a sense for the deferred revenue position in HPC and AI with the business you already have lined up and scheduled to deliver? You obviously already have one that was reach acceptance in Q3 already. And maybe give us a sense for the operating margin level that, that revenue is expected to come in at. Do you expect -- I mean, given the project costs times are taking in advance of revenue recognition, how much catch-up profitability might you get? And what does the margin profile look like a business that's expected for the back half of the year? Thanks.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. Listen, I'm continuing to be incredibly bullish about this business. Supercomputing is necessary to advance AI and deep learning solutions to solve some of the biggest societal challenges and honestly, climate and other. As I think about the current situation we are in, we have almost $3 billion in backlog. A couple of two quarters ago, we were talking about $2.5 billion and maybe a year, $1 billion, $1.5 billion. So, we have been continuing to grow the momentum with customers. By the way, it's all over the world. If you look at the wins, including the number three supercomputer called Lumi, that's in Europe. We have also supercomputers in France, in Germany and so forth. So, we are clearly the market leader there. However, this business is lumpy, as we said, right, from the time you book the order to time you recognize revenue, it can be several quarters. And the reason that's the case is because there are large installations and customers need to go through their own process to validate the world load. And over time, right, we're going to have a quarter, you're going to see a massive growth in revenue, which is not linear in many ways as many of those customer systems gets accepted. So, -- but in terms of margins, I will let Tarek comment on this. Obviously, have to look at long-term, not just quarter-by-quarter because that's not how this business works.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes, that's right. You said very well, Antonio. I'll add to the margin part of the question saying, our Q2 operating profit margin was affected by the ramp in project-related costs, and they were recognized ahead of revenue for a couple of very large mega deals that we're expecting to close by year-end. And therefore, as a result of that, we expect operating margins to return to more in range with historical levels on this business, and we feel pretty good about these prospects.\nAndrew Simanek: Great. Thanks, Kyle, for the last question. Antonio, I'll turn it over to you for some closing remarks.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thanks, everyone. I know there's a lot going on a lot of news today to cover, but I appreciate you making the time. Again, walk away from this quarter, feel good about the momentum we have with the persistent demand that we see in the market with an amazing set of solutions that are attracting customers. A testament of that is 20%, again, bookings with a backlog that gives us the confidence to deliver on our commitments. And honestly, I'm optimistic about the future, about the opportunity to innovate for our customers and to deliver the value to our shareholders. So again, thanks for your time today. I know there will be follow-up calls after this call, and I appreciate you making the time.\nAndrew Simanek: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Well thank you, Andy and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining today's earnings call. HPE's second quarter results reflect significant customer traction for our differentiated portfolio and underscore our progress in becoming the edge-to-cloud company. The macroeconomic environment of the last few months has presented enterprises around the world with strategic challenges that are usually not confronted all at once. The market shifts have certainly created a dynamic backdrop for our global customers and have made it harder for them to realize their goals in the short-term. But more than ever, organizations need technology partners to help them weather challenges, while successfully digitizing and transforming their businesses in order to increase their market competitiveness. HPE's ability to address these customer needs was key to our performance in the second quarter. Once again, HPE generated significant orders growth, steady revenue, and sustained profitability, even as tight supply conditions continued across global industries. We are seeing persistent demand from our customers, underscoring both their IT spending prioritization and the attraction to our compelling portfolio. Very strong customer demand in the second quarter drove orders growth higher, rising 20% year-over-year, which makes this the fourth quarter in a row that HP has logged year-over-year orders growth of 20% or better. Our HPE GreenLake H2 Cloud platform contributed to as-a-service orders doubling year-over-year, the third straight quarter of triple-digit growth. We continue to see a great deal of customer interest in our platform, which is evident in our sales pipeline. Our orders backlog across the business is high quality, and we are now -- we are seeing particular strength in our Intelligent Edge and Compute segments, with orders climbing 45% and 23%, respectively. HPC and AI orders grew more than 18%, bringing backlog there to an impressive record of approximately $3 billion. Total HPE revenue rose 1.5% year-over-year to $6.7 billion against a record break in backlog of orders in the midst of industry supply constraints. ARR climbed 25%. We have momentum across the portfolio with our as-a-service model differentiating us. This quarter, though, through a combination of supply constraints, limiting our ability to fulfill orders as well as some areas where we could have executed better, we did not fully translated the strong customer orders into higher revenue growth. I am confident that we have identified where we can strengthen and expect continued improvement as we move into the back half of the year. Importantly, the quarter's biggest standout, even if we were somewhat limited by supply chain, is that we maintained non-GAAP gross margins of 34%, thanks to disciplined execution and timely pricing actions. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.44, which together with our Q1 results, makes the first half of 2022, the second strongest EPS half year performance at HPE on a continuing operations basis. As Tarek will detail for you, we are reaffirming our full year outlook of revenue growth of 3% to 4% and our long-term 2024 revenue CAGR outlook. We are also reaffirming our full fiscal year free cash flow guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As announced in February, we suspended all shipments to and sales in Russia and Belarus. We have now determined that it's no longer tenable for us to maintain operations in these countries. Therefore, today, we are announcing the closing of our operations in both countries and we'll proceed with an orderly managed exit. Our business in these countries represents less than 2% of HPE's total revenue in fiscal year 2021. We have booked $126 million pre-tax charge related to the impact of Russia to our business, which is included in our second quarter GAAP earnings per share results. We expect less significant additional charges in the third quarter related to winding down these operations, partially to reflect this necessary action and partially to unfavorable foreign exchange movement, we are updating our full fiscal year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to between $1.96 to $2.10, which is the guidance we provided at our Securities Analyst Meeting last October. In the short term, we recognize the supply and logistics constraints, rising inflation and evolving economic and geopolitical conditions are all contributing to a dynamic environment. However, enterprise demand continues to persist across our entire portfolio. We are focused on translating the demand we see in the market and a high-quality backlog into profitable growth, while continuing to closely manage our inventory position. When even the supply of low-value components can be hard to secure in today's environment, we will continue to be disciplined and prudent in our decision-making to deliver on our commitments. As we look to the future, we are strengthening the scale and resilience of our supply chain, including opening a new factory in the Czech Republic for next-generation HPC and AI technologies, which will help us address the very solid demand we have for these specialized solutions. There is no question that we have positioned HPE well to help our customers double down on digital transformation. HPE GreenLake is at the center of our strategy to deliver edge to cloud solutions to enable customers data first modernization strategies. I hope many of you will join us later this month to see firsthand how our strategy comes to life when we host HPE Discover live in Las Vegas for the first time in three years. We will have a lot to show you as it has been an exciting few months for our customers and for HPE. In March, we announced features on HPE GreenLake that deliver greater choice and simplicity. We added 12 new cloud native services with now more than the total of 50 cloud new services available through the platform. We also continue to expand our partner ecosystem, increasing the number of partners actively selling HP GreenLake this quarter by more than 50% from the same period last year. In addition, partners who sold multiple HPE GreenLake deals in the quarter increased by 2.5 times year-over-year. At the edge, our capabilities are high demand as organizations need to securely connect distributed workforces and create engaging experiences. We are focused on delivering cloud-native services that can more easily embed intra automated networks to absorb evolving networking configurations. And with the convergence of Aruba Central and HPE GreenLake, more than 120,000 Aruba customers now have access to the HPE GreenLake platform. As customers adopt hybrid multi-class solutions, we know they also need a secure and flexible on-premises cloud solution. We were recently selected as the prime provider for Google's cloud distributed hosted solution. HPE GreenLake will enable Google to deliver an on-premises cloud experience for organization with strict data residency, security, and privacy requirements. Our hybrid cloud offerings have attracted nearly 150 new customers in Q2, including BMW Group, who is using HPE GreenLake to streamline and unify the company's data management across its global locations in the cloud and Worldline, the world's fourth largest provider who chose HPE GreenLake to implement their major performance upgrade to its payment platform as it continues to deliver against a cashless economy vision. HPE Financial Services had a unique hand in the Worldline upgrade to HPE GreenLake, with our asset renewal program funding approximately 25% of the refresh. From a data perspective, we continue to make meaningful enhancement that allow customers to extract more insights from their data to accelerate business outcomes. For instance, we are creating sophisticated AI models to generate and share insights in distributed environments. In April, we introduced HPE Swarm Learning, which enables users to share learnings through an AI model at the edge and from distinct sites without compromising data privacy. One university in Germany is already using in HPE Swarm Learning to more accurately diagnose colon cancer by applying AI learnings that can predict cancerous genetic alterations. And early this week, Frontier, an HPE designed and built system became the world's first and the fastest exascale supercomputer, taking the number one ranking on the world's top 500 list of supercomputers, exceeding the 1 exaflop performance threshold for the first time. To put this in perspective, this performance is three time faster than the number two super computer. HP has deployed four of the top 10 supercomputers and ranked first, second, third and fourth, on the Green 500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. Our service pivot is also innovative in the way it helps our customers meet their sustainability goals. HPE Relay helped customers reduce their carbon footprint by more than 30% versus traditional IT models. Later this month, when we release our Living Progress Report, we will share more about our efforts to support our customers' goals, while pushing ourselves in the industry to improve our own. Few of us could have predicted that the challenges of the last several years would require enterprises to adopt so dramatically. I spent at least 50% of my time with customers around the world, and I can tell you that when they think about how they are going to reimagine their futures, they see HPE as an even more relevant innovation partner than ever before. As I reflect on Q2 and look ahead to the future, I am confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments. We have the right strategy to capitalize on market trends, with an expansive edge-to-cloud portfolio that's connected through our market-leading HPE GreenLake platform. We have significant momentum with our customers. And perhaps most importantly, we have been -- we have a truly stellar team. I am proud of the 60,000 team members who make our results possible and who help us deliver on our purpose as a company. This team will continue to innovate and execute in ways that will further set us apart and continue to create value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to walk you through the details of our business segment results and overall performance. We can. I would say, Aaron, obviously, we're going to enter 2023 with an elevated backlog, which bodes us well for the future revenue growth of the company. As I said in my remarks, we continue to be very confident in our CAGR outlook that we provided at SAM for the next three years. But obviously, as we go forward, the backlog will be reduced supply and other issues alleviates. And if you think about the 3% to 4% guidance for the year, which is the guidance we provide at SAM versus the 1.5% we just reported, obviously, there will be low single-digit growth sequentially on that revenue. Thanks, Simon. Appreciate it. Operator, can we have the next one please? Yes. Thank you. Thank you for the question. As I said in my remarks, we continue to see ongoing persistent demand from our customers. I think it's a combination of them prioritizing IT spend. And honestly, the attraction to our portfolio. We have a very comprehensive portfolio from Edge to Cloud that is resonate in the market. And Tarek just talked a little bit about the strength of the Edge, which grew now in excess of 40% for four consecutive quarters. That's simply remarkable. And yet, we just delivered 9% revenue growth. So that tells you the strength of the demand. As you think about this distributor enterprise, there's just new way to work. I think the other area, obviously, as customers continue to assess their hybrid multi-cloud journeys, which is now here to stay. They see HPE GreenLake as a very solid alternative to what I call flexibility, choice and control. And the fact that one of the major clouds is leveraging HPE GreenLake to basically deliver their managed hosted distributor cloud, is a testament of that differentiation. The other thing, obviously, anything related to data is simply very strong. I think the demand for big data, analytics, AI, machine learning will continue to grow. And that's because customers need to extract insights from the data, which I think is the most valuable thing they have. Obviously, cybersecurity, Aruba with our SD-WAN and our SASE approach also provides an alternative to that. So, I think as I look forward, I personally believe and being at the World Economic Forum for the last week and listening, I think the potential slowdown is more a consumer issue more than an enterprise issue. And the reason why I said that is because every customer we talk to, they are prioritizing digitizing their businesses, modernizing their businesses, deploying cloud as an experience in this multi-cloud approach because it's all about speed and agility, and obviously, as I said before, extract every bit of insight from the data. And that's our strategy against the trends we see with HPE GreenLake, which is a data first modernization approach. Our demand is super strong, 20%, four consecutive quarters for HPE is pretty remarkable and our order backlog, as we said early on, is high quality, which means it's order -- the order book is firm. We don't see any major cancellation that will concern us at all. And last but not least, to Tarek's point, we priced the backlog to preserve gross margins. And that's what gives us the confidence not only to grow revenue, but continue to deliver our operating margin commitments and ultimately EPS commitments. The impact of Russia is -- and Belarus because you have to combine these two, is less than 2% of the revenue on a continuous basis. If you look at 2021, in terms of EPS, Tarek explained it and unpacked it for you, which we were able to kind of offset in many ways with overperformance in Q1. So, Tarek, any comments you want to say? And I will say, our diversification of our coverage around the globe also is a good positive thing for us. Yes. Let me start and I would like Tarek to talk about the free cash flow, Wamsi. Listen, so far, so far, and I can only talk so far, I have not seen any major deviation from 90 days ago on demand, continue to be very strong. And that's why we use the word persistent. Persistent meaning is there, right? And then I think it depends on what happens here in the back half of the year with some of the other policies, Tarek mentioned some of them in Europe. But obviously, as we think about inflation, interest rates and whatnot, that may or may not have an impact. But as I said earlier, Wamsi, I think it's mostly on the consumer side and the enterprise side. If anything, I will argue, it will have a positive impact to our GreenLake because customers want to maybe preserve some CapEx and then would use more of the as-a-service model. And still, deal with the reality that this is a hybrid multi-cloud journey, and therefore, for those award loads and data that cannot move outside their premises or a colocation or even moving from the edge for that matter, GreenLake is perfectly suited for that. And that's why it's a combination of our solutions, now 50-plus cloud native services, the fact that Google is going to use our solution is a very strong endorsement. But I think we are positioned to capture either way. And I think our backlog gives us a very strong foundation to build from there as we look forward. Tarek, you want to talk about the free cash flow question? This way -- one thing for me to say is that we are exactly what we were at the October Security Analyst Meeting, where we guided 3% to 4% revenue growth; the EPS guidance we just provided today, which is $1.96 to $2.10; and a free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. And knowing the seasonality of our business, we say at the time this year will be a normal seasonality business as you take the two years of COVID out of the way, we are very confident to deliver that number. It's exactly what Tarek said, it's the working capital is going to turn favorable to us. And as we continue to drive the backlog down over time, that will help us as well. So, the earning correlation to free cash flow is the same we provided as one. And in terms of restructuring, just to be clear on that one, we are very pleased with the progress we've made, which obviously was there, we refer to the time reallocating resources to the areas of growth, you can see the areas of growth being HPC, AI, edge, and GreenLake, obviously, which are paying off to us and on track to deliver the $800 million net savings that we committed at the time. Sure. I'm going to start. But I think -- I don't think you can look quarter-by-quarter. Honestly, you have to look at the half and then in the second half. If you look at our performance in Q1, we did very well. And on the balance, I think we are pleased with the first half. Listen, and then there is a lot of puts and takes here because factory locations plays a role. So sometime you're in the right side of the location, sometimes you're not. And obviously, for us, the impact of Shenzhen and Shanghai was there in April, and Tarek quantified that for you, that impacted not just the compute business, every line of business because other products come from that side.

We made it better in Q1, maybe a little bit less so in Q2. Again, some of our competitors, namely Dell, as you said, on some aspects. But on a balance, not that far off, again, Cisco definitely we did well on every metric you want to look at it. And -- but in the end, we are focused on the full year to deliver that guidance of 3% to 4% and obviously exit the year with still quite a large backlog, which bodes well for 2023. Yes.

But I think also shows our strategy to drive profitable revenue growth, not just revenue for the sake of revenue. Sure. Thanks, Rod. Next question, please? That's a great question. We see that more and more. Obviously, I think what customers are battling is the fact they are going through a multigenerational IT journey here. That they have to modernize. The fact that data has gravity and obviously, some industry are more regulated than others. Then you talk about latency and experience that really matters. Cost, obviously, is another big component because at scale, they need to comprehend the cost aspect of it.

In a way, they are moving away from running IT to more innovating on IT and that's why this data-first modernization approach is so relevant. And that's why we already have more than $6 billion in the balance sheet related to the HPE GreenLake business, which again grew 107% in Q2. And obviously, that -- those bookings eventually will unwind from the balance sheet and through the P&L. And the other important fact here that Tarek show in one of his slides, is the fact that our mix of GreenLake is shifting every single quarter to more software and services, which obviously comes with a significant higher margin than just the hardware.

And over time, right, we're going to have a quarter, you're going to see a massive growth in revenue, which is not linear in many ways as many of those customer systems gets accepted. So, -- but in terms of margins, I will let Tarek comment on this. Obviously, have to look at long-term, not just quarter-by-quarter because that's not how this business works. Well, thanks, everyone. I know there's a lot going on a lot of news today to cover, but I appreciate you making the time. Again, walk away from this quarter, feel good about the momentum we have with the persistent demand that we see in the market with an amazing set of solutions that are attracting customers. A testament of that is 20%, again, bookings with a backlog that gives us the confidence to deliver on our commitments. And honestly, I'm optimistic about the future, about the opportunity to innovate for our customers and to deliver the value to our shareholders. So again, thanks for your time today. I know there will be follow-up calls after this call, and I appreciate you making the time."

            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slide 1 and 2. So now let me discuss our Q2 performance details, starting with Slide 3. We continue to see robust demand across our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio with order growth up 20% year-over-year, the same as last quarter. This marks our fourth quarter in a row with order growth of 20% or better year-over-year. This maintains our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year 2022 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% growth adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 Securities Analyst Meeting. We delivered Q2 revenues of $6.7 billion, up 1.5% year-over-year and in line with our outlook of normal sequential seasonality and despite a more challenging supply environment that limited upside. The unexpected COVID-related shutdowns in China and seizing the support of Russia services contracts impacted our revenue by more than $250 million in the quarter, our total operating margins by more than one point and EPS by approximately $0.06. Given the delta between our order and revenue growth rates, our backlog further increased to new record levels and yet remains very high quality. The order book is firm and most importantly, has been priced to preserve gross margins. We are particularly pleased with the resiliency of our non-GAAP gross margins despite the inflationary environment and ongoing supply chain disruptions that are driving up material and logistics costs. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 34.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially and down just 10 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings. Non-GAAP operating margins were 9.3%, reflecting the revenue impact from incremental supply constraints and our exit from Russia that reduced operating leverage. We expect operating margins to expand in the short term as we drive more leverage from revenue growth and benefit from investments in the high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio. Within other income and expense, we benefited from robust operational performance in H3C and further gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder investment portfolio. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP other income and expense for fiscal year 2022 to be an income of approximately $75 million versus prior guidance of an approximately $25 million income. Given our strength in gross margin and despite the approximately $0.06 impact from China and Russia, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44, near the midpoint of our outlook range of $0.41 to $0.49 for Q2. We also delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.19. This includes $126 million of disaster charges related to Russia, primarily consisting of an increased reserve for financing lease assets. With the decision to already exit Russia that we have announced today, we expect to record and less significant GAAP-only charge in Q3 that has been factored into our updated outlook already. As previously indicated, we expected free cash flow to be in line with our normal seasonality that is a use of cash in the first half and Q2 was a use of cash of $211 million. We have made significant investments in working capital during the first half, reflecting our strategic inventory actions to navigate the current supply environment. This will better position us to convert orders into future revenue and cash flow, while working capital is expected to become a tailwind in the second half. Finally, we continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $156 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in July. We also repurchased $58 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total capital returns to $498 million, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation. Slide four highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. We continue to see very strong momentum across our as-a-service portfolio, where we introduced 12 new cloud services this quarter and converge Aruba Central with the HPE GreenLake platform to create a unified operational experience for all users. Total as-a-service orders were up 107% year-over-year, marking the third quarter in a row with orders more than doubling. Our ARR was up 25% year-over-year to $829 million, with supply constraints continuing to limit some installations. While our ARR growth is somewhat volatile in the current supply environment, the strong order growth over the last several quarters is the best indicator of the long-term health of this business. This gives us confidence in delivering our 35% to 45% CAGR target from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024, with increasing margins as our mix of both software and services continues to increase to 64% in Q2, up more than 5 points year-over-year with our expanding cloud and SaaS offerings. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 5. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, demand for our secure connectivity solutions accelerated with orders growing 45% year-over-year, the fifth consecutive quarter with growth of more than 35%. Despite increased supply disruptions in China, revenue grew 9% year-over-year, outperforming the competition and demonstrating particular strength in Silver Peak and our Edge-as-a-Service offerings, both up strong double-digits. We delivered operating margins of 12.6%, reflecting higher component and logistics costs, resulting in lower operating leverage. We expect margins to improve next quarter with higher levels of revenue that also benefit from previous price actions that are sticking. In HPC and AI, demand remains robust with order growth of 18% year-over-year, driving our awarded contracts total to another record level of just under $3 billion. Revenue grew 5% year-over-year and was impacted by one large customer acceptance delay that impacted growth by more than six points and has now been delivered in Q3.  Importantly, our Q2 operating profit was impacted by the ramp in project costs for a couple of mega deals expected to close by the end of the year that will return operating margins to more in range with historical levels. In Compute, order growth remained robust and was up over 20% year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, while revenue growth was up 1%, reflecting a more difficult supply environment. We continue to be very focused on executing a dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistics cost and gives us a very high-quality backlog. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.9%, up 270 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially, well above our long-term target set at SAM 2021 of 11% to 13%. Within Storage, we achieved another record level of product backlog that is skewed towards our owned IP margin-rich products. Revenue was down 2%, reflecting supply constraints for our own IP products. As a result, we continue to have unfavorable revenue mix that pressured our margins this quarter. We expect both our revenue growth rates and margins to improve over the next few quarters as we work through our favorable backlog mix and steer more demand towards our new Electra  and Block Storage offerings. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including storage services, orders again grew mid-single digits year-over-year as reported, similar to levels for total fiscal year 2021. As you know, this is very important for the long-term health of our most profitable business. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 2% year-over-year with strong performance in GreenLake and revenue was flat. Our profitability continues to benefit from higher residual value realization as customers tend to extend the use of their systems in a supply-constrained environment. Our operating margin was 12.6%, up 180 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 20.4% remains well above the 18%-plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide six highlights our revenue and EPS performance where you can see we've maintained relatively constant levels from last year despite incremental supply constraints, in particular, from the China shutdowns and also are seizing to support services contracts in Russia. As a reminder, this combines for more than a $250 million impact to revenue and a one point impact to total operating margins and an approximately $0.06 impact to EPS in Q2. In spite of these headwinds, we delivered a better quality of earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our Edge to Cloud strategy. The improved quality of earnings can be seen on slide seven, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q2 of 34.2% showing their resilience in spite of the increased component and logistics costs. This was driven by both our strategic pricing actions and the favorable mix shift we've been driving towards edge and our as-a-service business. Moving to slide eight, you can see our non-GAAP operating margin this quarter of 9.3%, reflecting the reduced operating leverage from supply challenges and our exit from Russia. However, we are achieving much better efficiency in our sales and office investments when measuring productivity on an orders basis. Given our high-quality backlog, we are also continuing to invest more in both R&D and our go-to-market for future growth. On slide nine, let's spend some time reminding everyone about our unique setup in China through H3C. As disclosed in an 8-K in late April, we have extended our existing food option that is struck at 15 times trading 12-month earnings through to October 31st, 2022. We did this to enable the new investors at the Unigroup level to complete their restructuring, which is proceeding as planned before determining a longer term path forward for our stake. We value our presence in China, the second largest and fastest-growing IT market, although we will balance prior to execution of any extension, the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk. H3C makes up a significant portion of our P&L and cash flow and you can see that we are generating growing value to shareholders with our unique setup. Our equity interest rose 21% in fiscal year 2021 and has grown 32% in this Q2 of fiscal year 2022. We will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer term solution for this valuable asset. Turning to slide 10, our free cash flow was a use of cash of $211 million. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality with the first half being a use of cash followed by strong generation of free cash flow in the second half. The first half of this year has also been uniquely impacted by the supply chain environment as we strategically built inventory levels in Q1 that were flat in Q2. We are taking further strategic actions to improve supply chain visibility and attain operational and financial benefits. This will put us in a better position to begin converting orders and generate healthy amounts of cash as working capital will turn into a tailwind in the back half of the year. We will need to demonstrate strong execution in the second half, but we have a path forward and expect to deliver fiscal year 2022 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 11. We are revising our fiscal year 2022 non-GAAP outlook range back to our original outlook provided at SAM of $1.96 to $2.10. This reflects the impacts of a more unfavorable currency movements since last October, the exit of the business in Russia, the COVID-related disruptions in China to this date, offset by the other income and expense benefit we've received in the first half. From a top line perspective, we are very pleased with the continued strength in orders and growing backlog that gives us confidence in future revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. We do want to remain prudent in the short term, given the ongoing supply challenges that we believe will likely last well into next year. Currency is also expected to now be a two-point headwind to revenue for the full year as opposed to the 50 basis points at the start of our fiscal year. As a result, we still have strong confidence in our fiscal year 2022 revenue growth outlook of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency and expect to end the year with elevated levels of backlog, which bodes well for fiscal year 2023. More specifically, for Q3 2022, we expect revenue to be up low single-digits sequentially. This is slightly below our normal seasonality to reflect our expectations that the China shutdowns will have a lingering impact in the short term. As a result, for Q3 2022, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.22 to $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.54. So overall, I'm pleased with how we are executing in a strong demand but challenging supply environment during the first half of fiscal year 2022. With our high-quality backlog, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing Edge to Cloud opportunity and deliver against all of our financial commitments set at SAM 2021. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you. Yes, we can Aaron. Yes, good afternoon Charles, thank you for the -- Aaron, good afternoon for the question -- thank you for the question with regard to our backlog. I would say our backlog has not peaked yet. When you have four consecutive quarters of 20% growth and the delta between the backlog growth, order growth and the revenue being what it is, the backlog has not peaked and will probably peak towards the end of this fiscal year. Our assumptions on converting that backlog into revenue are contained in the guidance that we gave for this fiscal year of 3% to 4% revenue growth adjusted for currency. I want to reiterate to you that the FX impact in that guidance is a 2% headwind as opposed to a 50 basis point headwind that we originally forecast. Sure. So, let me try and unpack this for you. So, first of all, when you really look at our business across the various segments, Aruba is continuing to do extremely well and we outperformed the competition, specifically Cisco in the second quarter. And the order book in Aruba is absolutely substantial. As you can observe, Aruba growth -- and you know Aruba comes with higher gross margin, has a favorable impact on the mix. The second thing I would point out to you is with respect to compute, the disciplined pricing actions that we've taken now for several quarters with compute continue to bear fruit. Compute operating profit margins at well above 13%, well above our long-term guidance, have also been better than what our main competitor in that space, Dell, has delivered for their total ISG margins that include compute, storage, and networking. So, compute is performing much, much better than the rest of the industry. Third, when you really look at the gross margin mix again across the other segments, particularly Storage and HPC, there are two different stories there. With respect to storage, you have a mix between our own IP product and third-party product that has been unfavorable to us, meaning that there were more third-party product revenues and on IP revenue. And you can see, therefore, that this has had a detrimental impact to gross margins for storage. Finally, HPC, the story there is a story that is we've always been saying, it's a lumpy business, and it's a matter of revenue scale. We had one slippage of a deal that has affected growth by six points in the quarter. That deal has closed into Q3. And really, the fundamental question for HPC is the delivery of substantial mega deals that we have planned for the second half. And so if you take all of this into account and you look at overall gross margins for the company, the story is different by segment. But it is the result of a number of actions that we have taken in Aruba and in Compute, offset by product mix shift in storage and revenue delays in HPC. On the whole, very pleased to have our gross margins where they are at 34.2%, up sequentially and better than last year. And finally, let me add to this, the performance of HPFS. The performance of HPFS is outstanding. You can see that while there is not much revenue growth. And this is not a gross margin business, it's a business that delivers substantial amounts of profit by way of operating profit margins. And the return on equity there in HPFS is very, very strong, north of 20%, which is better than our long-term outlook of 18-plus percent that we gave you at SAM 2021. So I hope this gave you color and I up back things f or you the way you want it, Simon. But if not, we're welcome to take the conversation offline with you again. Yes. So, let me add on the last part of your question. So, the impact from Russia on orders was negligible. This was not something that has affected our orders. China and Russia together, obviously, with Belarus, impacted our revenue by $250 million, the majority of that impact relates to China. And the Russia impact specifically is related to the fact that we cannot operate any more in the country and serve existing customers with our services contracts, and therefore, this has been factored into the impact. I've described that totals for China and Russia, 1% impact on total operating profit margins and $0.06 on EPS overall. But again, the majority of these impacts were driven by the China disruptions on the supply side of the equation. And yes, I agree with Antonio on the -- totally agree on the resiliency of the demand. I simply want to add the fact that even though there could be a slowdown in the EU, the European governments are ramping up a number of initiatives that are all in our favor in the digital space, which gives us confidence for the medium to long-term. Yes, sure. So first Wamsi, if you want a rough rule of thumb when you're looking at EPS changes and how these EPS dollars translate or sense translates into free cash flow, every cent of EPS is essentially $13 million to $15 million, right? So when you look at the lowering of our guidance is very much contained in the guidance we gave at the free cash flow level. So the lowering of our guidance back to the SAM 2021 guide is very much contained in the free cash flow guide that we gave you. And the reason why we gave you this free cash flow guide was because of the working capital assumptions that we had made at the beginning of our fiscal year. So I feel comfortable that we are within the free cash flow guide. Now the second part of your question is what makes you confident that in the second half, you can generate this quantity of free cash flow given where you are at the end of the first half. I would simply say to you that we expect, first and foremost, working capital to become a tailwind in the second half as opposed to the first, where it was a headwind because of the inventory actions that we've taken. And by the way, we've done this before. In fiscal year 2019, I want to remind everybody, we generated in the first half, $200 million of free cash flow and in the second half, we generated $2.2 billion. So, more than -- 10 times more than what we generated in the first half. This was offset by $666 million that we had to pay for an arbitration case that we lost at the time in fiscal year 2019. And we had very little time to turn around and offset the impact of that arbitration case, and yet we came into our guide that we gave at the time. And really look also at the trends on operating free cash flow that we highlighted to you as part of this call, you will observe that our seasonality is very much in line with fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020. Fiscal year 2021 was a different story because in fiscal year 2021, you add the impact of restructuring costs that were affecting free cash flow. And if you will observe the detail of our press release with the tables that we provided you, you will see that our restructuring costs are coming down overall relative to fiscal year 2021. So, lots of puts and takes there, but we are happy to reaffirm the free cash flow guide of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Yes. I want to add also, Rod, that the -- in what you said, it's really important to look at what happens at the bottom line and at the margin level. And when you really look at how we've outperformed Dell on the margin level, Q1 and Q2, considering it simply the compute margins alone compared to the ISG margins is very telling. Yes, that's right. You said very well, Antonio. I'll add to the margin part of the question saying, our Q2 operating profit margin was affected by the ramp in project-related costs, and they were recognized ahead of revenue for a couple of very large mega deals that we're expecting to close by year-end. And therefore, as a result of that, we expect operating margins to return to more in range with historical levels on this business, and we feel pretty good about these prospects."

With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\nAntonio Neri : Thanks, Andy. And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I discuss our results, I would like to address the evolving situation in Ukraine and how we are responding. Our first priority in the region is the safety of our team members, our contingent workers and their immediate families. We are conducting regular proactive outreach to our workforce in Ukraine to offer emergency assistance, making our security team available 24/7 to help.  The HP Foundation has established a special giving campaign for our team members to support humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, which has already raised $150,000 in just over 24 hours. And we are expanding the time off we offer team members to volunteer so those in the regions can care for their families and participate in humanitarian relief activities. From the business perspective, we have suspended all shipments into Russia at this time and we'll continue to adhere to all relevant sanctions and export controls.  Now let me review our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Hewlett Packard Enterprise deliver a solid performance. The quarter was characterized by robust customer demand and profitability, demonstrating the strength of our differentiated edge-to-cloud strategy and our portfolio innovation. Our business pivot is further strengthening our growth and operating margins. As a result of our overall performance this quarter, we are increasing our outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for the full fiscal year 2022.  In Q1 we saw all the growth of 20% from the prior year period, including 136% rise in other service orders. We increased total HP revenue by 2% year-over-year to $7 billion, despite continued industry wide supply constraints, which slowed our ability to convert orders and record breaking backlog to revenue.  We generated a non-GAAP gross profit margins of 33.9% higher than the prior quarter and prior year. I'm particularly pleased that we delivered 11% non-GAAP operating margin. Free cash flow was negative $577 million in the quarter, reflecting normal seasonality and proactive actions we continue to take the for the buffer inventories in order to meet robust customer demand and forward-looking growth.  The performance we deliver this quarter was not worthy in a micro environment that continues to be defined industry wide by supply shortages and overloaded logistic channels. Our global operations team is mitigating the impact by prudently building inventory when appropriate, and leaning on our long-standing supplier relationships. We continue to utilize our world class supply chain engineering capabilities to adjust the type of components we use, shifted into those that are more readily available.  We are not seen any noticeable order cancellations from customers due to elongated delivery times. And we continue to take pricing actions in this inflationary environment. As we discussed previously, we expect supply constraints we likely last well into the second half of calendar year 2022.  Demand for our differentiated edge-to-cloud products and solutions continues to be very strong, with Q1 marking the third consecutive quarter, we have generated a year-over-year order growth above 20%. This was also the second consecutive quarter of that our as-a-service orders more than doubled year-over-year.  Customers are turning to HP for a differentiated portfolio adopting our solutions to drive their transformation at the faster and faster pace. Several key technology trends that are shaping the IT industry are aligned directly with our strategy to become the best cloud company through our HP GreenLake platform offering.  The edge is creating new sources of data. Our customers need secure connectivity to power emerging distributed enterprise with remote workforces while delivering new digital experience to their stakeholders. The world is hybrid, cloud is an experience that customers increasingly expect to have wherever their worlds live. The result is a growing demand for multi-cloud experiences including clouds that live on premises at the edge in colocation or in a public cloud. We have entered the age of insight in data is the most precious asset. Digital transformation is creating new possibilities for enterprises, and customer needs solution to extract insights from the data to accelerate business outcomes.  And when customers tell us they want to address this market shift, they are increasingly looking to do so through a flexible as-a-service consumption model that enables them to pay only for the IT they use. Customers seeking to capitalize on these market trends opportunities are turning to HP GreenLake as the platform of choice. As always Tarek will provide details about the business results for each of our segments.  I will note a few highlights that underscore our performance this quarter, as well as our innovation interaction with customers. Customers a requirement for a unified operating experience across edge-to-cloud and the desire to consume IT in a flexible way is fueling the tremendous or this growth of our HP GreenLake edge-to-cloud age, which saw record demand in Q1 with as-a-service orders of 136% year-over-year. During the quarter, we ordered more than 100 new HP GreenLake customers, bringing the total count to more than now 1,350 customers who have adopted the HP GreenLake platform because of its compelling value proposition.  On the new HP GreenLake customers, we announced in Q1 was Barclays, which is using HP GreenLake to deliver his private cloud platform as a part of the bank's hybrid multi-cloud strategy and digital transformation across its global banking businesses.  The traction we are seeing in the market for HP GreenLake is driving us to further accelerate the transformation of HPE into a national cloud company. On March 22, we will unveil significant new innovations and enhancements to our HP GreenLake platform to help customers manage their hybrid clouds more easily protect and get more value from the data and securely connect at the edge. Our as-a-service transformation is my number one priority, and it is already delivering results for our shareholders as evidenced in our Q1 performance and increase non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year 2022.  Our as-a-service favorite is accelerating momentum and key growth businesses. Our intelligent edge business segment grew revenues 11% year-over-year and for the fourth consecutive quarter, so year-over-year over this growth of over 35%, driven by the very strong demand in secure connectivity from edge-to-cloud. Our Aruba Edge cloud offerings continue to drive new customers. The Aruba Central Cloud native cloud platform now manages more than 120,000 customers and more than 1.9 million network devices.  In Q1, we announced that our Aruba Cloud managed branch offering is being adopted by Brasfield & Gorrie, one of the largest privately held construction companies in the United States. The company is using our networking portfolio to elevate their construction site innovation with impressive tools like virtual reality views of projects before they are built.  Also in the quarter, we introduced the Aruba Edge Connect Microbranch, an industry leading home office cloud based networking solution that lets remote personnel work seamlessly and securely wherever they are located. Our High Performance Compute and AI business also generate a noteworthy product or the growth of more than 20% year-over-year, which has increased our total order book to a record of approximately $2.7 billion.  During the quarter we announced a win with the United States Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory to build a new supercomputers that will advance R&D for tomorrow's clean energy systems. Our computer storage businesses experienced robust or the growth and outstanding profitability. In Q1, nearly 10% of computer stores large orders were sold as a service. Compute generated more than 20% or the growth year-over-year, expanded the gross margins and attractive operating margins up 240 basis points year-over-year driven by strong pricing discipline.  Storage growth product order growth are more than 15% year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. Innovation is unrelenting, as we transform this segment into data services business. For example, in Q1 or venture arm Hewlett Packard Pathfinder invested in BigID. This is a leading data intelligent platform to help organizations realize detailed insights in their sensitive personal and critical data and then act on it.  Our HPE Pointnext Services team is helping customers navigate through their multi-generational IT journey while modernizing building and running the new hybrid IT space. In Q1 HP Pointnext Services orders increased mid-single digits year-over-year.  Turning to our workforce, we reopened all of our United States offices last month to those who wish to return after careful analysis of information and guidance from the public health officials. I was very pleased to meet team members in-person at a new cutting-edge Houston headquarters. You may have caught a glimpse of a Houston campus innovation in the video that ran before this call. We look forward to the official grand opening in April.  Alongside advancing rewarding workplaces, I also believe that HP has a responsibility to become a more climate resilient company. And we know it is a priority for our customers and shareholders. HPE Financial Services plays an important role in our sustainability strategy, providing asset upcycling to customers, which means reuse of millions of technology assets while freeing up capital for customers to reinvest in their businesses. Customers are choosing HPE in part because of our portfolio sustainability attributes. In fact, in fiscal year 2021, we drove nearly $900 million in revenue from sustainability related customers engagements.  I am proud of our team members not just for bringing breakthrough customer centric innovation, but for how they're bringing it to market. They are making bold moves to maximize what we can do for our customers and shareholders. It is this type of collaboration and engagement as compelling of business transformation. It is clear from strong customer feedback and momentum across our businesses that HPE is increasingly well positioned to capitalize on the edge-to-cloud mega trends that define our IT industry.  HP GreenLake is at the center of our strategy to pivot the company and it is generating record breaking demand with impressive profitability across our business. This continues to be uncertain times. As we monitor the dynamic global stage, I am more confident than ever about our future and our ability to drive long term sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders because of our strategy and differentiated innovation.  Now I would let Tarek to talk you through the quarter\u2019s performance in detail. Tarek?\nTarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed the key highlights on slide one. So now let me discuss our Q1 performance details starting with Slide 2.  We're off to a good start delivering against our commitments for fiscal year \u201922 with strong momentum continuing to build across the business. The demand continues to be robust for our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio with order growth up 20% year-over-year, marking our third quarter in a row with order growth at or above 20% year-over-year. This bolsters our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year \u201822 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 securities analyst meeting.  We delivered Q1 revenues of $7 billion, up 2% year-over-year and in-line with our outlook of normal sequential seasonality, despite a continuously challenging supply environment. As a result, our backlog further increased to record levels with a firm order book that shows no signs of double ordering, or any noticeable cancellations. We were particularly pleased with the quality of our earnings including the resiliency of our gross margins, despite the ongoing supply constraints that are driving up material and logistics costs.  We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 33.9%, up 90 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin, software-rich offerings. Non-GAAP operating margin has also been resilient at 11%, slightly down 30 basis points year-over-year, but up 130 basis points sequentially. We're achieving all of the expected savings from our cost actions announced mid-pandemic while continuing to make investments in our high growth, margin rich areas of our portfolio to fuel further revenue and profitability.  Within other income and expense, we benefited from further strong gains related to increased valuations in our investment portfolio and robust operational performance in HPC. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP other income and expense for fiscal year '22 to be an income of approximately $25 million versus prior guidance of a $20 million to $40 million expense. As a result of our strength in margins that more than offset the continued supply challenges, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, well above the high-end of our outlook range of $0.42 to $0.50 for Q1. As previously indicated, we expect the free cash flow to be in-line with our typical seasonality that is lowest in Q1, with a use of cash of $577 million for this quarter. We also continue to take strategic inventory actions to navigate the current supply environment. Our inventory is now up $2.5 billion year-over-year to $5.3 billion in support of the substantial order book that we have. This will better position us to convert orders into future revenue and cash flow.  Finally, we continued to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $155 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in April. We also repurchased $129 million in shares during Q1, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation. Slide 3 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. We made meaningful progress during Q1. We added more than 100 customers and well over $500 million of total contract value that brings the current total TCV to more than $6.5 billion. Total as-a-service orders were up 136% year-over-year. As a proof point of our as-a-service pivot momentum as a service order growth has accelerated every quarter going back to Q1 of last year.  Our ARR was up 23% year-over-year to $798 million with supply constraints limiting some installations. While our ARR growth might be somewhat volatile in the current supply environment, the strong rate accelerated -- accelerating order growth over the last several quarters is the best indicator of long-term health of this business. This gives us confidence in delivering our 35% to 45% CAGR target from fiscal year '21 to fiscal year '24, with increasing margins as our mix of both software and services continue to increase to 64% in Q1, up more than 4 points year-over-year. Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, demand for our secure connectivity solutions continued unabated with orders growing more than 35% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter. Despite increasing supply constraints, revenue grew 11% year-over-year with strength across the portfolio. Both wired switching and wireless LAN grew approximately 10% with Aruba Services up even stronger driven by our Edge-as-a-Service offerings up strong double digits.  We also delivered strong operating margins of 17.4%, this is a 650 basis point sequential improvement despite higher component and logistics costs, demonstrating that our price actions are sticking. In HPC and AI, demand remains robust with product order growth of more than 20% year-over-year, driving our awarded contracts total to another record level of approximately $2.7 billion. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year, but was impacted by two large customer acceptance delays that impacted growth by more than 10 points in Q1 and are now on track to be delivered in Q2. Our Q1 operating profit was obviously also impacted by these pushouts, and we expect operating margins to return to more in range with historical levels going forward.  In compute, order growth was up over 20% year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, while revenue growth was flat, reflecting the difficult supply environment. We have been very focused on executing a dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistic costs. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.8%, up 240 basis points year-over-year and 440 basis points sequentially, well above our long-term target of 11% to 13%.  Within storage, product order growth was up in the high teens year-over-year. This was the fourth quarter in a row of 15% or better year-over-year product order growth. Revenue was down 3%, reflecting increasing supply constraints, particularly for our owned IP products. As a result, we had an unfavorable revenue mix that pressured our margins this quarter. We expect both our revenue growth rates and margins to improve over the next few quarters as we continue to shift our portfolio towards higher-margin products and supply constraints ease. With respect to Pointnext Operational Services, including storage services, orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year as reported similar to levels for total fiscal year '21. As you know, this is a very important for the long-term health of our most profitable business. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 11% year-over-year, and revenue was down 1%. Our write-offs as a percentage of assets, excluding the impact of two frauds in the UK and Asia Pacific was 47 basis points, which is below pre-pandemic levels. Our profitability also continues to benefit from higher residual value's realization and lower borrowing costs as we continue to securitize our U.S. portfolio via the ABS market. Our operating margin was 12.4%, up 260 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 19.7% remains well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum entering fiscal year '22, and this despite a more supply-constrained environment versus a year ago. We are also delivering a better quality of earnings with our portfolio mix continuing to shift to our higher growth and higher margin execute our edge-to-cloud strategy. Turning to Slide 6. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q1 of 33.9%, up both year-over-year and sequentially despite all of the increased component and logistic costs. This was driven by both strong pricing discipline and the favorable mix shift we've been driving towards edge and our as-a-service business. Moving to Slide 7. You can see our non-GAAP operating margin this quarter of 11%, representing a 130 basis point sequential increase. We also delivered roughly the same operating profit versus last year despite a more challenging supply environment while continuing to invest significantly more in both R&D and our go-to-market for the future, thanks to a much better quality of earnings and gross margins. Turning to Slide 8. Our free cash flow was a use of cash of $577 million. This is more aligned to our typical pre-pandemic seasonality if you look at Q1 in fiscal year '20 or the prior years. Cash flow in Q1 of this year has also been uniquely impacted by the supply chain environment as we have strategically continued building inventory levels. This will better position us to begin converting orders and generate healthy amounts of cash in the back half of the year, reflecting also our typical seasonality. We, therefore, continue to expect to deliver fiscal year '22 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 9. Given our strong performance in Q1 and building momentum across the business, I am pleased to announce that we are raising our full year non-GAAP diluted net EPS outlook range for fiscal year '22 by $0.07 at the midpoint to $2.03 to $2.17.  From a top-line perspective, we were very pleased with the continued strength in orders and growing backlog that gives us confidence in future revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond. We do also want to remain prudent in the short term given the ongoing supply challenges that we continue to believe will likely last well into the second half of the calendar year. As a result, we still have strong confidence in our fiscal year '22 revenue outlook of growth of 3% to 4% and expect to end the year with elevated levels of backlog, which bodes well for fiscal year '23. More specifically, for Q2 2022, we expect revenue to be in-line with our normal sequential seasonality of down low to mid-single digits and are comfortable with current consensus. As a result, for Q2 '22, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.18 to $0.26 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.41 to $0.49. So overall, I am very pleased with our first quarter of fiscal year '22. Our edge-to-cloud strategy is resonating with customers and driving strong demand across our portfolio. This enabled us to deliver a good start to the fiscal year with increasing momentum and a raised outlook. We are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing opportunity and deliver against all of our financial commitments set at SAM 2021.  Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross : Thank you very much. I wanted to maybe dig a little bit more into linearity during the quarter and what you're hearing from customers in terms of demand given all the geopolitical challenges. You talked about backlog increasing to record levels. I'm wondering, how much of that do you think our customers planning ahead? Or thinking about longer lead times versus near-term demand that's not just being able to be met right now?  And I don't know, just what are you hearing because are customers sort of shifting the way that they think about how they're buying at this point in time? And I guess just the final sort of question within that is, how does this benefit or does it benefit your GreenLink and your as-a-service strategy? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri : Well, thanks, Shan. So as you can imagine, I spend a lot of time talking to customers. In fact, 50% of my time is with customers and partners. And the one consistent theme is that we said in our quarter has 13 weeks and every week has been super strong. We put specific goals for our sales force every week that we track very closely. Tarek runs a very tight process on that. And we have always exceeded every week's forecast.  And the feedback is driven by the following: number one, obviously, we know digital transformation is getting stronger and stronger out there, and it's driven by the fact that you've got to digitize your process to be competitive. And number two, data continue to explode everywhere, and that means that they need more capacity to store the data, but most importantly, process that data at the pace we haven't seen before. And that's a combination of AI, analytics, deep learning at scale and obviously, a lot of compute power. The third piece, obviously, as I said in my remarks, is that the edge continue to grow very, very rapidly. And in order to transform in a digital environment, you need connectivity. Without being connected, you don't have the on-ramp through this digital transformation. Of course, customers are concerned about inflationary costs going forward. They monitor what's happening out there. And -- but in the end, I think all of this, when you balance the demand for these trends, and I talk about the trends, right, in the megatrends. And then the fact that customers want to consume more flexibly don't want to put all that CapEx to work, GreenLake is getting significant attention.  And that's why I said when I think about the future of this company, the product is HPE GreenLake. Everything gets delivered through HPE GreenLake, whether it's a connectivity through a subscription model, whether it's computer storage that you can consume elastically with data services running on top of it, whether it's the services to operate in a HPE GreenLake, HPE GreenLake is becoming a platform of choice for many customers because offers that flexibility and in an architecture that's edge-to-cloud. And that's inclusive, by the way, of the public cloud. And that's why when you see the innovation we're going to bring in the next 2 weeks, it includes the public cloud in the way we manage that. So overall, I will say, great execution by our team. Customers need more IT now more than ever. And obviously, we are doing a good job, I will say, in the quality of earnings, pricing elasticity and everything we have done, which is the results of the profitability you saw in\nAndrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Shannon. Appreciate the question. Operator, can we have the next one, please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Congrats on the really solid gross margin performance in a very tough environment where others are really seeing a lot of pressure on their GP dollars and gross margins. I was hoping you can talk about the sustainability of these gross margins through the rest of the year, especially in light of the increasing DRAM and NAND cost? And it seems as though some of the logistics are really not letting up so far?  And maybe you can share some color on your ability to take incremental price actions and maybe share some color on what you've already been able to pass through in terms of pricing? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati : Wamsi, thank you for the questions. Yes, indeed, I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance this quarter, and we outperformed our competitors. It's pretty obvious when you look at what they have reported. And the resiliency of our gross margin is there for everyone to see and this despite the ongoing supply constraints that everyone has been facing with.  So we feel that this performance can be sustained, but the -- you have to adopt different pricing strategies across different segments. So we have to be incredibly dynamic in our compute segment that we have been, and this translates into significant operating profit margins at 13.8%, which is even higher than the long-term outlook that we put forward for that segment at SAM 2021. And in the rest of our portfolio, we have significant differentiation at the edge, in storage also in HPE Financial Services and HPC. So there, the pricing strategy is different. We take harder look at how much value can extract given that our portfolio there is more differentiated. But it's -- everyone is contributing here to making sure that the gross margins are sustainable.  Finally I want to highlight to you that as-a-service contributes and will continue to contribute in the long run to enhance gross margins. That's why we highlighted to you all on the -- in the slide presentation, the mix shift in the composition of the ARR. The more we continue to drive as-a-service growth, the better it is for gross margins ultimately.  But it's a dynamic environment. And to your point, you will see some pressure on some commodities. We feel we are well equipped with our inventory levels to withstand the pressure from these commodities. And this is why we buffered up inventory to the levels that we reported knowing that this is obviously to meet a substantial order book that is much higher than what we have experienced in prior years. As Antonio said, the demand in the quarter has been surprise us from its strength and resiliency standpoint.\nAndrew Simanek : Great. Thank you Wamsi for the question. Operator, can we have the next one, please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long : Thank you. Yeah, I was hoping to just follow up on some of the as-a-service business and deals. You mentioned getting some large deals and more backlog building there. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the complexion of what you're seeing from a solution set or a customer base driving that? And maybe a little bit on kind of what you see from pipeline on some of the customers looking to more take on the as-a-service type of offering as opposed to just kind of the standard of the build and buy? Thank you. \nAntonio Neri : Sure. Well, one of the marquee customers is actually your bank, Barclays, quite interesting. They needed a partner to take them to this hybrid journey. And in their case, they have tens and tens of thousands of VMs. So in their case, they wanted flexibility to scale up and down in a private cloud environment and yet integrate the public cloud as they go forward.  So they felt that, obviously, with GreenLake, they get the best of both words, an experience and a cost on-prem that's very competitive and ability to move VMs back and forth as they need. But the reality is that, that is driven by many factors. Number one, let's start with the edge, right? So obviously, a lot of the as-a-service now at the edge is done in a subscription model. You subscribe to the Aruba Cloud Platform now inside GreenLake. And then basically, you can provision connectivity with a few clicks.  But now we are seeing growth in what we call the NaaS environment, the Network-as-a-Service, where customers don't just want the subscription, but they want the full consumption, including the hardware and services in a managed services approach. They don't want to be in what I call the day 2 of the run part. So that comes with a lot of services. And that's why Tarek mentioned the combination of software and services is increasing. If you look at the colocation or the edge, where the cloud is moving as well, or datacenter, obviously, private cloud is one aspect, is that infrastructure-as-a-service component. But a lot is also world load optimized solutions, whether it's what else like VDI or whether it's SAP-as-a-Service, or Machine Learning as a Service. So we see existing workloads and new loads also being consumed as a service in these locations. So those are the type of deals And remember, it's not just the hardware and software, it's the services that comes with it because what we're seeing our customers, and we talked about some of the previous customers as well, they want HPE to run their solution end-to-end, which the managed services piece come as well with it. So it's a combination of Infrastructure-as-a-Service, connectivity and then as well, this world load optimization with more and more management as well as a hybrid estate, which includes the public cloud. And last but not least, obviously, if you think about data. Data is a major component. Data has a gravitational force. And at the same time, they want to apply these new techniques. That's why we see a lot of growth in the AI machine lending space. Both in the enterprise space and at scale through HPC. And that's why on the HPC side, we are very, very pleased with the momentum. As we know, that business becomes a little bit lumpy because of the customer acceptances. But this year, we're going to deliver some of the most amazing systems you can imagine at massive scale, where customers can process data we have not imagined before.  So it's a combination of all things that's what resulted in 136% growth. And that's why we are very excited about the momentum. But what excites me the most, honestly, is the innovation we're going to continue to bring in the platform called HPE GreenLake. And to the question that Shannon asked me earlier, that's why it's my priority number one, because it's working, it's driving more growth in the bookings and better profitability.\nAndrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Tim for the question. Operator, next one, please? \nOperator: The next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. I wanted to dig into the intelligent edge upside. You noted that order growth was still stronger than the revenue growth that you guys were able to post. And so kind of two parts of the question are just is some of the order growth that you're seeing still kind of return to office plans? Are we really starting to kind of move past this return to office-driven growth? And then on the second piece, just on the revenue upside that you were able to post, is that some kind of loosening of availability for networking chips? Or is there anything that led to kind of outperformance in that segment or losing the supply chain in that segment more than others? Thanks.\nAntonio Neri : Sure. Well, thank you for the question. And I will start and Tarek can add on. If you go back to 2018, when I became CEO, I said that the edge is the next frontier, and we will invest in innovation over the next 40 years. We are now seeing the results of that investment because we have a unique value proposition in as-a-service model that actually is accelerating our momentum there. And you saw the numbers, right, 35% growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. This is not just a data point in the chart, there is four of them in the data in the chart that they are driving strong demand. I think the pandemic has accelerated the need for that distributed connectivity. In fact, this quarter, we announced a new offer, the Edge Connect offer, which basically gives the customer the ability to manage the workforce wherever they are in a seamless, secure, integrated way and provision their connectivity wherever they are.  But listen, the scale or the platform we have, I think is unmatched. We already have more than 120,000 customers, which are consuming more and more services. They may start with Wi-Fi. They are in LAN, now they're in WAN. That's why we made the acquisition of Silver Peak more than 15 months ago. And soon, we're going to add 5G too. So in my view, this is just a buildup momentum. And the architecture of that business is about unification of the connectivity, which makes it simpler to run, the operations, the network operations, whatever that connectivity is, the security layer, which obviously is super important and then the analytics, because ultimately what customers like about our offer is the ability to use the data that we actually can provide through the network on performance and characteristics that allows that allows them to deliver a better experience.  And when you have almost 2 million devices, there is a lot of datapoints. In fact, so you know the scale every hour, we process almost 2 billion datapoints. And that's done around the globe in 13 different geos. And that gives the ability of the customer to provide these unique experiences. But again, that comes also with an improvement in operating margins, which is 17.4%, which is actually sequentially at 650 basis points.  I think on the supply, obviously, we have been working for some time. I can tell you we are -- we continue to place orders at least four, if not five quarters ahead of demand because we are so confident about this business to continue to grow. And, we have to work through sometimes, we get a little bit better matching to what we have sometimes, we may live some orders unconverted. But on the long term, this is going to continue to be a shiny story for us.\nAndrew Simanek : Great. Thank you for the question, Meta. Can we go to the next one, please, operator?\nOperator: The next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of questions on the ARR side, ARR didn't grow on a sequential basis for the first time in a while. I know you talked about supply challenges, limiting some of the installations. Is there a seasonality element to the ARR growth? That's question number one. And secondly, GreenLake Services growth continued to accelerate more than double for the second consecutive quarter. Can you walk us through how long it takes for GreenLake orders to flow into the ARR calculation? I assume it's different for every business segment. Thanks. \nAntonio Neri : So let me start, and I'm sure the last part of the question, Tarek will answer how long it takes. No, I don't think there's any seasonality. This is up to the right. And it's just a matter of getting those installations completed. Sometime it's the supply, sometimes it's the customer readiness in some cases. But the reality is all driven by the availability of the systems for us to install. So that's the answer on that. But again, because of the momentum we have there, we are very confident on that 35% to 45% CAGR that we committed. And obviously, over time, this takes care of itself.  So that's on that part of the question. I don't see an issue at all.  The services piece I think you just mentioned -- I mentioned it before, right. As with GreenLake, the one important part is it comes with 100%, attach rates of Pointnext services. And as we go forward, obviously, that momentum continued to build a bigger, kind of deferred aspect of it. And at the same time, we also added the managed services piece of it, because many of the new deals we have been engaging. There was a question earlier about the pipeline, the pipeline looks amazingly strong, in some very large marquee deals in the making.  But with that said, the managed services piece is an additive to the attach because customers don't want to be in the in the round time anymore. So they are aligned, the GreenLake as a platform plus the services under needs to run their operations.  So maybe, Tarek, you want to talk about the conversion into ARR I think it is?\nTarek Robbiati : Yeah. So I mean, the simple answer to your question on how long does it take to see an order flow into the ARR and revenue terms is this. Our GreenLake model is an appliance-driven model, where effectively you have a complete stack from standard hardware platforms with services and software on top.  And so to the extent that we have to deliver that complete stack solution, it takes -- obviously, it's important that we deliver the right hardware to be able to start to recognize the revenue. By the moment we deliver the appliance and the revenue flows based on the contract duration, and we have flagged to you and possibly to -- in prior occasions that the services revenue, which makes the bulk of the ARR with the software is recognized overtime over the duration of the contract. And the contract duration varies between 36 and up to 55-58 months, in some cases, 60 months.  And so this is why it takes time to develop the ARR. But the really important thing to note is the size of the total contract value that we have on the balance sheet. So if you really look at the contract value that we have on the balance sheet, we increased it by $500 million in this quarter, taking the total to $6.5 that will unwind in the upcoming, say, 60 months at the worst. So that's the dynamic that you have here in terms of orders versus revenue and ARR recognition.\nAntonio Neri : Which is a great question because, obviously, if you look at our ARR, again, at $800 million this quarter. And our total contract value $6.5 billion and more than 64% now is software and services. Overtime, you will see the impact it has on our results, both quality of the revenue mix and quality of the earnings because as Tarek said, obviously, everything we do through GreenLake is accretive. And so that's why we are excited about the momentum we have on GreenLake.\nAndrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Sidney for the question. Operator, next one please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. And congrats on the results. I guess I wanted to kind of frame you -- how you're thinking about the full year revenue of guidance at 3% to 4% relative to the backlog build. So if I look at the revenue guidance at the midpoint, it would seem to suggest you expect a stronger second half relative to what we've seen over the past few years, second half versus first half.  So I guess my question is what's your assumptions around backlog build? And when maybe we see that peak and you start to ship against that backlog, is that factored into your revenue growth expectation from this year?\nAntonio Neri : Great question. And I think if you think about it in Q1, right? So we grew orders 20% and revenue 2%. It means that we're growing orders 10 times faster than the revenue. And so that's the simple message there. But the reality is that, obviously, we said that the supply will challenge that we see. And by the way, logistics, right, which obviously comes with other issues will be well into the second half of '22. So this is a matter of timing more than anything else.  And definitely, we said -- we feel very good about the 3% to 4% revenue, but it's going to depend to that ability to get the supply that we need in the right time, in the right mix. Remember, we have a very large portfolio. Not all orders are created equal to the point that Tarek made earlier. And then we see. Obviously, as we go through, we're going to assess what else may happen there. But definitely, it's just a timing issue at this point in time, more than anything else.  And we expect that to get better as we go along. But the message that you imply that second half will be higher, absolutely. There is no question about it. The question is how high depending on the ability to convert the backlog. I will say the backlog right now in Q1 is bigger than Q4. And Tarek and I believe that backlog has not peaked. And also remember on the backlog, we have a lot of HPC systems, which, in some cases, by the way, have already been built and delivered. But it takes several months to get it running, which basically until you run the payload and the world load and some of them need to go what I call the top 100 HCL --HPL kind of testing. You are now going to get the acceptance. So that's why, maybe a quarter, you're going to have a huge acceptance and this will happen. Well, that's will happen is the acceptance of some of the system. And Tarek talked about two systems that slipped from Q1 into Q2. So you got all these dynamics. But definitely, second half will be better and then hopefully carries on into '23 because the demand is still super strong.\nTarek Robbiati : Yeah. Aaron, if I can add to Antonio's answer. When we gave guidance at SAM, we told you all that we are targeting 3% to 4% revenue growth in fiscal year '22 with the second half of the year counting for more than the first half of the year. Nothing has changed to that picture. If anything, the order strength is greater than what we anticipated at SAM, and it surprised us somewhat in because -- and I just want to remind you what Antonio said in his first answer to the first question, orders have been strong for 13 weeks in Q1.  And so when you really look at what's happening on two fronts: first, on our inventory levels, we are acquiring substantial amounts of inventory to cater for the strength of the order demand. And so if you also look at what the delta is between order growth and revenue growth, as Antonio said, we're clearly not at peak backlog. That is going to continue. It bodes well for fiscal year '22 and for fiscal year '23 as well. Finally, the thing I want to highlight to you is the impact of foreign exchange rates. When we were together at SAM in October, we mentioned that we were expecting 50 basis points of headwind due to foreign exchange rates. Now obviously, the situation is slightly different. The dollar is stronger, and we expect a full point headwind of 50 basis points. But yes, we are comfortable reiterating the 3% to 4% top line revenue growth, because of the strength of the order book.  So hopefully you can see the link between orders in revenue, orders backlog inventory built up and ultimate revenue guidance that we give on a constant currency basis. \nAndrew Simanek : Great, thanks. Appreciate the question. Operator, next one, please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have to ask a free cash flow question now. I guess, Tarek, down $600 million free cash flow or thereabouts, it's somewhat more severe than what I would think normal seasonality should be. So maybe you can just flesh out how much of this you think is seasonal versus perhaps things driven by working capital inefficiencies and there's a big spike or drop in these other assets and liabilities, maybe you can just start what happened there as well. And then importantly, as I go through the year, do I think about April being somewhat more muted in free cash flow as well and in the back half being better? Or what does that cadence look like?\nAntonio Neri : Okay. So Tarek?\nTarek Robbiati : Okay. So a couple of things on -- to on to your question. First of all, the negative $577 million free cash flow is mainly driven by working capital. If you really look at the buildup in inventory, we now have $5.3 billion of inventory. This has had an adverse impact on the cash flow conversion cycle. And so our cash flow conversion cycle is a positive 20 days, which is an increase of 17 days relative to the prior quarter because we're stocking up inventory given the order demand and the order book that we have.  So that's a main driver. Is it seasonal relative to the prior years, yes, but not fiscal year \u201821? You have to go back to the first quarter of fiscal year '20 and prior years to determine free cash flow seasonality moving forward. But we feel good about our ability to generate free cash flow as we work through the backlog and reduce the inventory levels. And this is why we reaffirmed the free cash flow guide of $1.8 billion to $2 billion for fiscal year '22. There was another part of your question, which I forgot, I think you were talking about the movement in other assets and liabilities. Andy would want to take that one, please?\nAndrew Simanek : Yeah, so that's generally related to our comp plans where we pay out our bonus in the first quarter. So that's one of the reasons why if you look at our typical seasonality. As Tarek said, going back to fiscal year \u201920, a year before, you'll generally see Q1 is always a use of cash.  Great. Well, thank you, Amit. I appreciate the question. I think operator, we have time for one more, please.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Kyle McNeely with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nKyle McNealy: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. Great job on the results in such a difficult environment for everyone else. We have some recent survey work that we did that shows enterprises are expecting a higher-than-normal level of refresh activity in the coming year, specifically for servers and storage. We assume that some of that might be catch-up on upgrading aging infrastructure coming out of the pandemic. But are you seeing that type of activity come through in helping the results? And what would be your expectation for refresh and upgrade activity for the balance of the year 2022?\nAntonio Neri: Sure, Kyle. Yeah. Of course, customers are now thinking about what else they need to succeed in this new environment. Definitely, the pandemic put a halt on their expenses because, obviously, at the beginning of pandemic, everybody was in preservation mode, on liquidity. But at the same time, I think there is a component of modernization, which I call it better than refresh. And also the need to deploy these new technologies. It's not anymore about a cloud mandate. It's about what they're going to do with that data. Because cloud is just a means to the end, right? It's all about accelerating speed and agility. But what customers are looking also is what type of things they need to do with that data.  So it\u2019s a combination of data exploring, connectivity required in this digital world and the fact that you need to stay up to these new ways to deliver IT, while the transition this journey to the multigenerational IT. Because many of these customers have a lot of complexity. They have legacy assets that they have a lot of data with applications that are not really replatform. They cannot replatform. They are older ones that, honestly, they need to, what I call, cloudify, but most importantly, we need to deploy these new technologies around data. So that's why our vision to become the edge-to-cloud platform company is so spot on. Because it's aligned to those megatrends of connectivity, cloud and data that you can consume as-a-service. And that's why the future of the company long-term is GreenLake, is that a product that drives the rest of the portfolio with higher margins and obviously, more recurring revenues for us and for our shareholders.\nAndrew Simanek: Well, great. Thank you, Kyle for the question and everybody else participating. Antonio maybe I\u2019ll turn it back to you for some closing remarks.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah. So obviously, very pleased with the Q1 performance, solid start. Again, the quarter was characterized by the customer demand, very robust customer demand and very strong profitability. I think it's showing the strength of our strategy and in differentiated portfolio innovation.  I think we're very well positioned against the strengths, as Kyle just ask at the end. But obviously, we live in interesting times, right? So -- and right now, we have to be vigilant about that. Our priority is to continue to execute on our commitments and also make sure we can contribute to the society as a whole because this company has a unique value and culture.  So proud of not only what we deliver, but how we deliver. So I hope you stay safe and well. And hope to speak to you soon. Thank you for your time today. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you. ",

            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy. And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I discuss our results, I would like to address the evolving situation in Ukraine and how we are responding. Our first priority in the region is the safety of our team members, our contingent workers and their immediate families. We are conducting regular proactive outreach to our workforce in Ukraine to offer emergency assistance, making our security team available 24/7 to help.  The HP Foundation has established a special giving campaign for our team members to support humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, which has already raised $150,000 in just over 24 hours. And we are expanding the time off we offer team members to volunteer so those in the regions can care for their families and participate in humanitarian relief activities. From the business perspective, we have suspended all shipments into Russia at this time and we'll continue to adhere to all relevant sanctions and export controls.  Now let me review our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Hewlett Packard Enterprise deliver a solid performance. The quarter was characterized by robust customer demand and profitability, demonstrating the strength of our differentiated edge-to-cloud strategy and our portfolio innovation. Our business pivot is further strengthening our growth and operating margins. As a result of our overall performance this quarter, we are increasing our outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for the full fiscal year 2022.  In Q1 we saw all the growth of 20% from the prior year period, including 136% rise in other service orders. We increased total HP revenue by 2% year-over-year to $7 billion, despite continued industry wide supply constraints, which slowed our ability to convert orders and record breaking backlog to revenue.  We generated a non-GAAP gross profit margins of 33.9% higher than the prior quarter and prior year. I'm particularly pleased that we delivered 11% non-GAAP operating margin. Free cash flow was negative $577 million in the quarter, reflecting normal seasonality and proactive actions we continue to take the for the buffer inventories in order to meet robust customer demand and forward-looking growth.  The performance we deliver this quarter was not worthy in a micro environment that continues to be defined industry wide by supply shortages and overloaded logistic channels. Our global operations team is mitigating the impact by prudently building inventory when appropriate, and leaning on our long-standing supplier relationships. We continue to utilize our world class supply chain engineering capabilities to adjust the type of components we use, shifted into those that are more readily available.  We are not seen any noticeable order cancellations from customers due to elongated delivery times. And we continue to take pricing actions in this inflationary environment. As we discussed previously, we expect supply constraints we likely last well into the second half of calendar year 2022.  Demand for our differentiated edge-to-cloud products and solutions continues to be very strong, with Q1 marking the third consecutive quarter, we have generated a year-over-year order growth above 20%. This was also the second consecutive quarter of that our as-a-service orders more than doubled year-over-year.  Customers are turning to HP for a differentiated portfolio adopting our solutions to drive their transformation at the faster and faster pace. Several key technology trends that are shaping the IT industry are aligned directly with our strategy to become the best cloud company through our HP GreenLake platform offering.  The edge is creating new sources of data. Our customers need secure connectivity to power emerging distributed enterprise with remote workforces while delivering new digital experience to their stakeholders. The world is hybrid, cloud is an experience that customers increasingly expect to have wherever their worlds live. The result is a growing demand for multi-cloud experiences including clouds that live on premises at the edge in colocation or in a public cloud. We have entered the age of insight in data is the most precious asset. Digital transformation is creating new possibilities for enterprises, and customer needs solution to extract insights from the data to accelerate business outcomes.  And when customers tell us they want to address this market shift, they are increasingly looking to do so through a flexible as-a-service consumption model that enables them to pay only for the IT they use. Customers seeking to capitalize on these market trends opportunities are turning to HP GreenLake as the platform of choice. As always Tarek will provide details about the business results for each of our segments.  I will note a few highlights that underscore our performance this quarter, as well as our innovation interaction with customers. Customers a requirement for a unified operating experience across edge-to-cloud and the desire to consume IT in a flexible way is fueling the tremendous or this growth of our HP GreenLake edge-to-cloud age, which saw record demand in Q1 with as-a-service orders of 136% year-over-year. During the quarter, we ordered more than 100 new HP GreenLake customers, bringing the total count to more than now 1,350 customers who have adopted the HP GreenLake platform because of its compelling value proposition.  On the new HP GreenLake customers, we announced in Q1 was Barclays, which is using HP GreenLake to deliver his private cloud platform as a part of the bank's hybrid multi-cloud strategy and digital transformation across its global banking businesses.  The traction we are seeing in the market for HP GreenLake is driving us to further accelerate the transformation of HPE into a national cloud company. On March 22, we will unveil significant new innovations and enhancements to our HP GreenLake platform to help customers manage their hybrid clouds more easily protect and get more value from the data and securely connect at the edge. Our as-a-service transformation is my number one priority, and it is already delivering results for our shareholders as evidenced in our Q1 performance and increase non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year 2022.  Our as-a-service favorite is accelerating momentum and key growth businesses. Our intelligent edge business segment grew revenues 11% year-over-year and for the fourth consecutive quarter, so year-over-year over this growth of over 35%, driven by the very strong demand in secure connectivity from edge-to-cloud. Our Aruba Edge cloud offerings continue to drive new customers. The Aruba Central Cloud native cloud platform now manages more than 120,000 customers and more than 1.9 million network devices.  In Q1, we announced that our Aruba Cloud managed branch offering is being adopted by Brasfield & Gorrie, one of the largest privately held construction companies in the United States. The company is using our networking portfolio to elevate their construction site innovation with impressive tools like virtual reality views of projects before they are built.  Also in the quarter, we introduced the Aruba Edge Connect Microbranch, an industry leading home office cloud based networking solution that lets remote personnel work seamlessly and securely wherever they are located. Our High Performance Compute and AI business also generate a noteworthy product or the growth of more than 20% year-over-year, which has increased our total order book to a record of approximately $2.7 billion.  During the quarter we announced a win with the United States Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory to build a new supercomputers that will advance R&D for tomorrow's clean energy systems. Our computer storage businesses experienced robust or the growth and outstanding profitability. In Q1, nearly 10% of computer stores large orders were sold as a service. Compute generated more than 20% or the growth year-over-year, expanded the gross margins and attractive operating margins up 240 basis points year-over-year driven by strong pricing discipline.  Storage growth product order growth are more than 15% year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. Innovation is unrelenting, as we transform this segment into data services business. For example, in Q1 or venture arm Hewlett Packard Pathfinder invested in BigID. This is a leading data intelligent platform to help organizations realize detailed insights in their sensitive personal and critical data and then act on it.  Our HPE Pointnext Services team is helping customers navigate through their multi-generational IT journey while modernizing building and running the new hybrid IT space. In Q1 HP Pointnext Services orders increased mid-single digits year-over-year.  Turning to our workforce, we reopened all of our United States offices last month to those who wish to return after careful analysis of information and guidance from the public health officials. I was very pleased to meet team members in-person at a new cutting-edge Houston headquarters. You may have caught a glimpse of a Houston campus innovation in the video that ran before this call. We look forward to the official grand opening in April.  Alongside advancing rewarding workplaces, I also believe that HP has a responsibility to become a more climate resilient company. And we know it is a priority for our customers and shareholders. HPE Financial Services plays an important role in our sustainability strategy, providing asset upcycling to customers, which means reuse of millions of technology assets while freeing up capital for customers to reinvest in their businesses. Customers are choosing HPE in part because of our portfolio sustainability attributes. In fact, in fiscal year 2021, we drove nearly $900 million in revenue from sustainability related customers engagements.  I am proud of our team members not just for bringing breakthrough customer centric innovation, but for how they're bringing it to market. They are making bold moves to maximize what we can do for our customers and shareholders. It is this type of collaboration and engagement as compelling of business transformation. It is clear from strong customer feedback and momentum across our businesses that HPE is increasingly well positioned to capitalize on the edge-to-cloud mega trends that define our IT industry.  HP GreenLake is at the center of our strategy to pivot the company and it is generating record breaking demand with impressive profitability across our business. This continues to be uncertain times. As we monitor the dynamic global stage, I am more confident than ever about our future and our ability to drive long term sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders because of our strategy and differentiated innovation.  Now I would let Tarek to talk you through the quarter's performance in detail. Tarek? Well, thanks, Shan. So as you can imagine, I spend a lot of time talking to customers. In fact, 50% of my time is with customers and partners. And the one consistent theme is that we said in our quarter has 13 weeks and every week has been super strong. We put specific goals for our sales force every week that we track very closely. Tarek runs a very tight process on that. And we have always exceeded every week's forecast.  And the feedback is driven by the following: number one, obviously, we know digital transformation is getting stronger and stronger out there, and it's driven by the fact that you've got to digitize your process to be competitive. And number two, data continue to explode everywhere, and that means that they need more capacity to store the data, but most importantly, process that data at the pace we haven't seen before. And that's a combination of AI, analytics, deep learning at scale and obviously, a lot of compute power. The third piece, obviously, as I said in my remarks, is that the edge continue to grow very, very rapidly. And in order to transform in a digital environment, you need connectivity. Without being connected, you don't have the on-ramp through this digital transformation. Of course, customers are concerned about inflationary costs going forward. They monitor what's happening out there. And -- but in the end, I think all of this, when you balance the demand for these trends, and I talk about the trends, right, in the megatrends. And then the fact that customers want to consume more flexibly don't want to put all that CapEx to work, GreenLake is getting significant attention.  And that's why I said when I think about the future of this company, the product is HPE GreenLake. Everything gets delivered through HPE GreenLake, whether it's a connectivity through a subscription model, whether it's computer storage that you can consume elastically with data services running on top of it, whether it's the services to operate in a HPE GreenLake, HPE GreenLake is becoming a platform of choice for many customers because offers that flexibility and in an architecture that's edge-to-cloud. And that's inclusive, by the way, of the public cloud. And that's why when you see the innovation we're going to bring in the next 2 weeks, it includes the public cloud in the way we manage that. So overall, I will say, great execution by our team. Customers need more IT now more than ever. And obviously, we are doing a good job, I will say, in the quality of earnings, pricing elasticity and everything we have done, which is the results of the profitability you saw in Sure. Well, one of the marquee customers is actually your bank, Barclays, quite interesting. They needed a partner to take them to this hybrid journey. And in their case, they have tens and tens of thousands of VMs. So in their case, they wanted flexibility to scale up and down in a private cloud environment and yet integrate the public cloud as they go forward.  So they felt that, obviously, with GreenLake, they get the best of both words, an experience and a cost on-prem that's very competitive and ability to move VMs back and forth as they need. But the reality is that, that is driven by many factors. Number one, let's start with the edge, right? So obviously, a lot of the as-a-service now at the edge is done in a subscription model. You subscribe to the Aruba Cloud Platform now inside GreenLake. And then basically, you can provision connectivity with a few clicks.  But now we are seeing growth in what we call the NaaS environment, the Network-as-a-Service, where customers don't just want the subscription, but they want the full consumption, including the hardware and services in a managed services approach. They don't want to be in what I call the day 2 of the run part. So that comes with a lot of services. And that's why Tarek mentioned the combination of software and services is increasing. If you look at the colocation or the edge, where the cloud is moving as well, or datacenter, obviously, private cloud is one aspect, is that infrastructure-as-a-service component. But a lot is also world load optimized solutions, whether it's what else like VDI or whether it's SAP-as-a-Service, or Machine Learning as a Service. So we see existing workloads and new loads also being consumed as a service in these locations. So those are the type of deals And remember, it's not just the hardware and software, it's the services that comes with it because what we're seeing our customers, and we talked about some of the previous customers as well, they want HPE to run their solution end-to-end, which the managed services piece come as well with it. So it's a combination of Infrastructure-as-a-Service, connectivity and then as well, this world load optimization with more and more management as well as a hybrid estate, which includes the public cloud. And last but not least, obviously, if you think about data. Data is a major component. Data has a gravitational force. And at the same time, they want to apply these new techniques. That's why we see a lot of growth in the AI machine lending space. Both in the enterprise space and at scale through HPC. And that's why on the HPC side, we are very, very pleased with the momentum. As we know, that business becomes a little bit lumpy because of the customer acceptances. But this year, we're going to deliver some of the most amazing systems you can imagine at massive scale, where customers can process data we have not imagined before.  So it's a combination of all things that's what resulted in 136% growth. And that's why we are very excited about the momentum. But what excites me the most, honestly, is the innovation we're going to continue to bring in the platform called HPE GreenLake. And to the question that Shannon asked me earlier, that's why it's my priority number one, because it's working, it's driving more growth in the bookings and better profitability. Sure. Well, thank you for the question. And I will start and Tarek can add on. If you go back to 2018, when I became CEO, I said that the edge is the next frontier, and we will invest in innovation over the next 40 years. We are now seeing the results of that investment because we have a unique value proposition in as-a-service model that actually is accelerating our momentum there. And you saw the numbers, right, 35% growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. This is not just a data point in the chart, there is four of them in the data in the chart that they are driving strong demand. I think the pandemic has accelerated the need for that distributed connectivity. In fact, this quarter, we announced a new offer, the Edge Connect offer, which basically gives the customer the ability to manage the workforce wherever they are in a seamless, secure, integrated way and provision their connectivity wherever they are.  But listen, the scale or the platform we have, I think is unmatched. We already have more than 120,000 customers, which are consuming more and more services. They may start with Wi-Fi. They are in LAN, now they're in WAN. That's why we made the acquisition of Silver Peak more than 15 months ago. And soon, we're going to add 5G too. So in my view, this is just a buildup momentum. And the architecture of that business is about unification of the connectivity, which makes it simpler to run, the operations, the network operations, whatever that connectivity is, the security layer, which obviously is super important and then the analytics, because ultimately what customers like about our offer is the ability to use the data that we actually can provide through the network on performance and characteristics that allows that allows them to deliver a better experience.  And when you have almost 2 million devices, there is a lot of datapoints. In fact, so you know the scale every hour, we process almost 2 billion datapoints. And that's done around the globe in 13 different geos. And that gives the ability of the customer to provide these unique experiences. But again, that comes also with an improvement in operating margins, which is 17.4%, which is actually sequentially at 650 basis points.  I think on the supply, obviously, we have been working for some time. I can tell you we are -- we continue to place orders at least four, if not five quarters ahead of demand because we are so confident about this business to continue to grow. And, we have to work through sometimes, we get a little bit better matching to what we have sometimes, we may live some orders unconverted. But on the long term, this is going to continue to be a shiny story for us. So let me start, and I'm sure the last part of the question, Tarek will answer how long it takes. No, I don't think there's any seasonality. This is up to the right. And it's just a matter of getting those installations completed. Sometime it's the supply, sometimes it's the customer readiness in some cases. But the reality is all driven by the availability of the systems for us to install. So that's the answer on that. But again, because of the momentum we have there, we are very confident on that 35% to 45% CAGR that we committed. And obviously, over time, this takes care of itself.  So that's on that part of the question. I don't see an issue at all.  The services piece I think you just mentioned -- I mentioned it before, right. As with GreenLake, the one important part is it comes with 100%, attach rates of Pointnext services. And as we go forward, obviously, that momentum continued to build a bigger, kind of deferred aspect of it. And at the same time, we also added the managed services piece of it, because many of the new deals we have been engaging. There was a question earlier about the pipeline, the pipeline looks amazingly strong, in some very large marquee deals in the making.  But with that said, the managed services piece is an additive to the attach because customers don't want to be in the in the round time anymore. So they are aligned, the GreenLake as a platform plus the services under needs to run their operations.  So maybe, Tarek, you want to talk about the conversion into ARR I think it is? Which is a great question because, obviously, if you look at our ARR, again, at $800 million this quarter. And our total contract value $6.5 billion and more than 64% now is software and services. Overtime, you will see the impact it has on our results, both quality of the revenue mix and quality of the earnings because as Tarek said, obviously, everything we do through GreenLake is accretive. And so that's why we are excited about the momentum we have on GreenLake. Great question. And I think if you think about it in Q1, right? So we grew orders 20% and revenue 2%. It means that we're growing orders 10 times faster than the revenue. And so that's the simple message there. But the reality is that, obviously, we said that the supply will challenge that we see. And by the way, logistics, right, which obviously comes with other issues will be well into the second half of '22. So this is a matter of timing more than anything else.  And definitely, we said -- we feel very good about the 3% to 4% revenue, but it's going to depend to that ability to get the supply that we need in the right time, in the right mix. Remember, we have a very large portfolio. Not all orders are created equal to the point that Tarek made earlier. And then we see. Obviously, as we go through, we're going to assess what else may happen there. But definitely, it's just a timing issue at this point in time, more than anything else.  And we expect that to get better as we go along. But the message that you imply that second half will be higher, absolutely. There is no question about it. The question is how high depending on the ability to convert the backlog. I will say the backlog right now in Q1 is bigger than Q4. And Tarek and I believe that backlog has not peaked. And also remember on the backlog, we have a lot of HPC systems, which, in some cases, by the way, have already been built and delivered. But it takes several months to get it running, which basically until you run the payload and the world load and some of them need to go what I call the top 100 HCL --HPL kind of testing. You are now going to get the acceptance. So that's why, maybe a quarter, you're going to have a huge acceptance and this will happen. Well, that's will happen is the acceptance of some of the system. And Tarek talked about two systems that slipped from Q1 into Q2. So you got all these dynamics. But definitely, second half will be better and then hopefully carries on into '23 because the demand is still super strong. Okay. So Tarek? Sure, Kyle. Yeah. Of course, customers are now thinking about what else they need to succeed in this new environment. Definitely, the pandemic put a halt on their expenses because, obviously, at the beginning of pandemic, everybody was in preservation mode, on liquidity. But at the same time, I think there is a component of modernization, which I call it better than refresh. And also the need to deploy these new technologies. It's not anymore about a cloud mandate. It's about what they're going to do with that data. Because cloud is just a means to the end, right? It's all about accelerating speed and agility. But what customers are looking also is what type of things they need to do with that data.  So it's a combination of data exploring, connectivity required in this digital world and the fact that you need to stay up to these new ways to deliver IT, while the transition this journey to the multigenerational IT. Because many of these customers have a lot of complexity. They have legacy assets that they have a lot of data with applications that are not really replatform. They cannot replatform. They are older ones that, honestly, they need to, what I call, cloudify, but most importantly, we need to deploy these new technologies around data. So that's why our vision to become the edge-to-cloud platform company is so spot on. Because it's aligned to those megatrends of connectivity, cloud and data that you can consume as-a-service. And that's why the future of the company long-term is GreenLake, is that a product that drives the rest of the portfolio with higher margins and obviously, more recurring revenues for us and for our shareholders. Yeah. So obviously, very pleased with the Q1 performance, solid start. Again, the quarter was characterized by the customer demand, very robust customer demand and very strong profitability. I think it's showing the strength of our strategy and in differentiated portfolio innovation.  I think we're very well positioned against the strengths, as Kyle just ask at the end. But obviously, we live in interesting times, right? So -- and right now, we have to be vigilant about that.

            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed the key highlights on slide one. So now let me discuss our Q1 performance details starting with Slide 2.  We're off to a good start delivering against our commitments for fiscal year '22 with strong momentum continuing to build across the business. The demand continues to be robust for our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio with order growth up 20% year-over-year, marking our third quarter in a row with order growth at or above 20% year-over-year. This bolsters our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year \u201822 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 securities analyst meeting.  We delivered Q1 revenues of $7 billion, up 2% year-over-year and in-line with our outlook of normal sequential seasonality, despite a continuously challenging supply environment. As a result, our backlog further increased to record levels with a firm order book that shows no signs of double ordering, or any noticeable cancellations. We were particularly pleased with the quality of our earnings including the resiliency of our gross margins, despite the ongoing supply constraints that are driving up material and logistics costs.  We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 33.9%, up 90 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin, software-rich offerings. Non-GAAP operating margin has also been resilient at 11%, slightly down 30 basis points year-over-year, but up 130 basis points sequentially. We're achieving all of the expected savings from our cost actions announced mid-pandemic while continuing to make investments in our high growth, margin rich areas of our portfolio to fuel further revenue and profitability.  Within other income and expense, we benefited from further strong gains related to increased valuations in our investment portfolio and robust operational performance in HPC. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP other income and expense for fiscal year '22 to be an income of approximately $25 million versus prior guidance of a $20 million to $40 million expense. As a result of our strength in margins that more than offset the continued supply challenges, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, well above the high-end of our outlook range of $0.42 to $0.50 for Q1. As previously indicated, we expect the free cash flow to be in-line with our typical seasonality that is lowest in Q1, with a use of cash of $577 million for this quarter. We also continue to take strategic inventory actions to navigate the current supply environment. Our inventory is now up $2.5 billion year-over-year to $5.3 billion in support of the substantial order book that we have. This will better position us to convert orders into future revenue and cash flow.  Finally, we continued to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $155 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in April. We also repurchased $129 million in shares during Q1, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation. Slide 3 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. We made meaningful progress during Q1. We added more than 100 customers and well over $500 million of total contract value that brings the current total TCV to more than $6.5 billion. Total as-a-service orders were up 136% year-over-year. As a proof point of our as-a-service pivot momentum as a service order growth has accelerated every quarter going back to Q1 of last year.  Our ARR was up 23% year-over-year to $798 million with supply constraints limiting some installations. While our ARR growth might be somewhat volatile in the current supply environment, the strong rate accelerated -- accelerating order growth over the last several quarters is the best indicator of long-term health of this business. This gives us confidence in delivering our 35% to 45% CAGR target from fiscal year '21 to fiscal year '24, with increasing margins as our mix of both software and services continue to increase to 64% in Q1, up more than 4 points year-over-year. Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, demand for our secure connectivity solutions continued unabated with orders growing more than 35% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter. Despite increasing supply constraints, revenue grew 11% year-over-year with strength across the portfolio. Both wired switching and wireless LAN grew approximately 10% with Aruba Services up even stronger driven by our Edge-as-a-Service offerings up strong double digits.  We also delivered strong operating margins of 17.4%, this is a 650 basis point sequential improvement despite higher component and logistics costs, demonstrating that our price actions are sticking. In HPC and AI, demand remains robust with product order growth of more than 20% year-over-year, driving our awarded contracts total to another record level of approximately $2.7 billion. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year, but was impacted by two large customer acceptance delays that impacted growth by more than 10 points in Q1 and are now on track to be delivered in Q2. Our Q1 operating profit was obviously also impacted by these pushouts, and we expect operating margins to return to more in range with historical levels going forward.  In compute, order growth was up over 20% year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, while revenue growth was flat, reflecting the difficult supply environment. We have been very focused on executing a dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistic costs. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.8%, up 240 basis points year-over-year and 440 basis points sequentially, well above our long-term target of 11% to 13%.  Within storage, product order growth was up in the high teens year-over-year. This was the fourth quarter in a row of 15% or better year-over-year product order growth. Revenue was down 3%, reflecting increasing supply constraints, particularly for our owned IP products. As a result, we had an unfavorable revenue mix that pressured our margins this quarter. We expect both our revenue growth rates and margins to improve over the next few quarters as we continue to shift our portfolio towards higher-margin products and supply constraints ease. With respect to Pointnext Operational Services, including storage services, orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year as reported similar to levels for total fiscal year '21. As you know, this is a very important for the long-term health of our most profitable business. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 11% year-over-year, and revenue was down 1%. Our write-offs as a percentage of assets, excluding the impact of two frauds in the UK and Asia Pacific was 47 basis points, which is below pre-pandemic levels. Our profitability also continues to benefit from higher residual value's realization and lower borrowing costs as we continue to securitize our U.S. portfolio via the ABS market. Our operating margin was 12.4%, up 260 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 19.7% remains well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum entering fiscal year '22, and this despite a more supply-constrained environment versus a year ago. We are also delivering a better quality of earnings with our portfolio mix continuing to shift to our higher growth and higher margin execute our edge-to-cloud strategy. Turning to Slide 6. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q1 of 33.9%, up both year-over-year and sequentially despite all of the increased component and logistic costs. This was driven by both strong pricing discipline and the favorable mix shift we've been driving towards edge and our as-a-service business. Moving to Slide 7. You can see our non-GAAP operating margin this quarter of 11%, representing a 130 basis point sequential increase. We also delivered roughly the same operating profit versus last year despite a more challenging supply environment while continuing to invest significantly more in both R&D and our go-to-market for the future, thanks to a much better quality of earnings and gross margins. Turning to Slide 8. Our free cash flow was a use of cash of $577 million. This is more aligned to our typical pre-pandemic seasonality if you look at Q1 in fiscal year '20 or the prior years. Cash flow in Q1 of this year has also been uniquely impacted by the supply chain environment as we have strategically continued building inventory levels. This will better position us to begin converting orders and generate healthy amounts of cash in the back half of the year, reflecting also our typical seasonality. We, therefore, continue to expect to deliver fiscal year '22 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 9. Given our strong performance in Q1 and building momentum across the business, I am pleased to announce that we are raising our full year non-GAAP diluted net EPS outlook range for fiscal year '22 by $0.07 at the midpoint to $2.03 to $2.17.  From a top-line perspective, we were very pleased with the continued strength in orders and growing backlog that gives us confidence in future revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond. We do also want to remain prudent in the short term given the ongoing supply challenges that we continue to believe will likely last well into the second half of the calendar year. As a result, we still have strong confidence in our fiscal year '22 revenue outlook of growth of 3% to 4% and expect to end the year with elevated levels of backlog, which bodes well for fiscal year '23. More specifically, for Q2 2022, we expect revenue to be in-line with our normal sequential seasonality of down low to mid-single digits and are comfortable with current consensus. As a result, for Q2 '22, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.18 to $0.26 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.41 to $0.49. So overall, I am very pleased with our first quarter of fiscal year '22. Our edge-to-cloud strategy is resonating with customers and driving strong demand across our portfolio. This enabled us to deliver a good start to the fiscal year with increasing momentum and a raised outlook. We are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing opportunity and deliver against all of our financial commitments set at SAM 2021.  Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you. Wamsi, thank you for the questions. Yes, indeed, I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance this quarter, and we outperformed our competitors. It's pretty obvious when you look at what they have reported. And the resiliency of our gross margin is there for everyone to see and this despite the ongoing supply constraints that everyone has been facing with.  So we feel that this performance can be sustained, but the -- you have to adopt different pricing strategies across different segments. So we have to be incredibly dynamic in our compute segment that we have been, and this translates into significant operating profit margins at 13.8%, which is even higher than the long-term outlook that we put forward for that segment at SAM 2021. And in the rest of our portfolio, we have significant differentiation at the edge, in storage also in HPE Financial Services and HPC. So there, the pricing strategy is different. We take harder look at how much value can extract given that our portfolio there is more differentiated. But it's -- everyone is contributing here to making sure that the gross margins are sustainable.  Finally I want to highlight to you that as-a-service contributes and will continue to contribute in the long run to enhance gross margins. That's why we highlighted to you all on the -- in the slide presentation, the mix shift in the composition of the ARR. The more we continue to drive as-a-service growth, the better it is for gross margins ultimately.  But it's a dynamic environment. And to your point, you will see some pressure on some commodities. We feel we are well equipped with our inventory levels to withstand the pressure from these commodities. And this is why we buffered up inventory to the levels that we reported knowing that this is obviously to meet a substantial order book that is much higher than what we have experienced in prior years. As Antonio said, the demand in the quarter has been surprise us from its strength and resiliency standpoint. Yeah. So I mean, the simple answer to your question on how long does it take to see an order flow into the ARR and revenue terms is this. Our GreenLake model is an appliance-driven model, where effectively you have a complete stack from standard hardware platforms with services and software on top.  And so to the extent that we have to deliver that complete stack solution, it takes -- obviously, it's important that we deliver the right hardware to be able to start to recognize the revenue. By the moment we deliver the appliance and the revenue flows based on the contract duration, and we have flagged to you and possibly to -- in prior occasions that the services revenue, which makes the bulk of the ARR with the software is recognized overtime over the duration of the contract. And the contract duration varies between 36 and up to 55-58 months, in some cases, 60 months.  And so this is why it takes time to develop the ARR. But the really important thing to note is the size of the total contract value that we have on the balance sheet. So if you really look at the contract value that we have on the balance sheet, we increased it by $500 million in this quarter, taking the total to $6.5 that will unwind in the upcoming, say, 60 months at the worst. So that's the dynamic that you have here in terms of orders versus revenue and ARR recognition. Yeah. Aaron, if I can add to Antonio's answer. When we gave guidance at SAM, we told you all that we are targeting 3% to 4% revenue growth in fiscal year '22 with the second half of the year counting for more than the first half of the year. Nothing has changed to that picture. If anything, the order strength is greater than what we anticipated at SAM, and it surprised us somewhat in because -- and I just want to remind you what Antonio said in his first answer to the first question, orders have been strong for 13 weeks in Q1.  And so when you really look at what's happening on two fronts: first, on our inventory levels, we are acquiring substantial amounts of inventory to cater for the strength of the order demand. And so if you also look at what the delta is between order growth and revenue growth, as Antonio said, we're clearly not at peak backlog. That is going to continue. It bodes well for fiscal year '22 and for fiscal year '23 as well. Finally, the thing I want to highlight to you is the impact of foreign exchange rates. When we were together at SAM in October, we mentioned that we were expecting 50 basis points of headwind due to foreign exchange rates. Now obviously, the situation is slightly different. The dollar is stronger, and we expect a full point headwind of 50 basis points. But yes, we are comfortable reiterating the 3% to 4% top line revenue growth, because of the strength of the order book.  So hopefully you can see the link between orders in revenue, orders backlog inventory built up and ultimate revenue guidance that we give on a constant currency basis. Okay. So a couple of things on -- to on to your question. First of all, the negative $577 million free cash flow is mainly driven by working capital. If you really look at the buildup in inventory, we now have $5.3 billion of inventory. This has had an adverse impact on the cash flow conversion cycle. And so our cash flow conversion cycle is a positive 20 days, which is an increase of 17 days relative to the prior quarter because we're stocking up inventory given the order demand and the order book that we have.  So that's a main driver. Is it seasonal relative to the prior years, yes, but not fiscal year \u201821? You have to go back to the first quarter of fiscal year '20 and prior years to determine free cash flow seasonality moving forward. But we feel good about our ability to generate free cash flow as we work through the backlog and reduce the inventory levels. And this is why we reaffirmed the free cash flow guide of $1.8 billion to $2 billion for fiscal year '22. There was another part of your question, which I forgot, I think you were talking about the movement in other assets and liabilities. Andy would want to take that one, please?"

Well thanks Jeff and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. In fiscal year 2023, HPE delivered record performance against non-GAAP financial metrics by capitalizing on strong momentum across our portfolio. Our steady execution has resulted in higher revenue, further gross margin expansion, larger operating profit, and record-breaking non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. Our growth engines in Intelligent Edge and HPC and AI, as well as our HPE GreenLake platform, are helping to accelerate our revenue and profit diversification. Importantly, HPE has achieved demonstrable success this year in our ongoing portfolio pivot to higher growth, higher margin areas aligned to the key market megatrends driving customer demand. I will focus my commentary today on our full-year fiscal year 2023 results and allow Jeremy to expand on the fourth quarter and segment results. I'm very proud of all that HPE delivered in fiscal year 2023 for our shareholders, our customers, and our team members. Our performance demonstrates the relevance of our strategy, our portfolio differentiation, and our strong execution. We delivered extraordinary innovation to customers, resulting in share gains in key markets and profitable growth for our company. HPE generated our highest gross margin and highest operating profits since I became CEO, and our highest annual revenue in four years. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow were the largest ever in our company's history. We saw healthy, sustained growth in revenue at $29.1 billion for the full-year, an increase of 5.5% year-over-year in constant currency, a third straight year of revenue [Technical Difficulty] point of our full fiscal year 2023 guidance of 5%. Gross margins exceeded 35%. We also added substantially to our annualized revenue run rate closing fiscal year 2023 with more than $1.3 billion in ARR. That represents a nearly $370 million increase from this time last year. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was up 20 basis points year-over-year to end the year at 10.8%. We have executed well on our addressable market opportunities and exercised prudence with our expenses and obligations. Non-GAAP EPS increased 6.4% year-over-year to $2.15. Improved profitability also means that we have significantly boosted free cash flows, which rose by about $400 million this year to $2.2 billion, and nearly 25% year-over-year increase. Both non-GAAP, EPS, and free cash flow results are record-breaking and well above our fiscal year 2022 sum guidance. In summary, HPE delivered an impressive set of results in fiscal year 2023. With the progress we have made this year and are confidence in generating further value for our shareholders, we are raising our dividends in 2024. HPE is more relevant than ever to our customers. We have deliberately aligned our strategy over the last few years to significant trends in the market around edge, hybrid cloud, and AI. These growth engines align to our customers' interests and where they are targeting their IT spend. Even against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, we saw continued though uneven, demand across our HPE portfolio with a significant acceleration in AI orders. Demand in our AI solutions is exploding. We saw a significant uptick in customer demand in recent quarters for accelerated computing infrastructure and services. In Q4, orders for servers that include accelerated processing units or APUs represented 32% of our total server order mix, up more than 250% from the beginning of fiscal year 2023. APUs, which includes GPU-based servers orders across our business, represented 25% of our total server order mix in fiscal year 2023. Our HPC & AI segment revenue grew 25% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. We ended this fiscal year with the largest HPC & AI order book on record, driven by $3.6 billion in company-wide APU orders. This tops what has been an historically large order book in the third quarter, as demand accelerated for our supercomputing and AI solutions. We anticipate demand next fiscal year will remain very strong. We likely have a large order backlog and the GPU supply is less constrained. Two weeks ago at the Supercomputing Conference, we expanded our collaboration with NVIDIA to announce a turnkey pre-configured supercomputing solution for generative AI to streamline the model development process. The new solution speeds up the training and fine-tuning of AI models using [Indiscernible] data sets. Designed for large enterprises, research institutions, and government organizations, it comprises HPE AI software, our industry-leading supercomputing and storage solutions. Our HPE Slingshot Interconnect Fabric and HPE services, and the Quad NVIDIA Grace Hopper GH200 Superchip. Later this week at HPE Discover Barcelona, we will further expand our NVIDIA partnership with new solutions created for enterprise customers. Also this month, the University of Bristol announced that HPE has been selected to deliver the U.K.'s fastest supercomputer, thanks to our U.K. government investment of GPB225 million intended to make the nation a world leader in AI. The Japan National Institute of Information and Communications Technology recently turned to HPE Cray XD supercomputers to develop an AI-based multilingual communication tool to process, translate, and interpret text and images for 17 languages. And we just announced a partnership with Dark Bite a provider of next-generation high-performance computing green data centers to power its AI cloud service with HPE Cray supercomputers and our purpose-built machine learning software suite. With HPE built supercomputers consistently ranked among monthly top 10 within the top 500 most powerful and sustainable supercomputers, our clear leadership in this space continues to position us well in the AI market. Our Intelligent Edge segment was the largest driver of our revenue and profit growth in fiscal year 2023, making up 18% of our overall revenue and 39% of the segment operating profit. Fiscal year 2023 revenue in this segment increased by 45% to $5.2 billion, while operating margins expanded more than 1,200 basis points year-over-year to 27.3%, demonstrating the relevance of our offering and the payoff of investments over time. A critical part of our intelligent edge portfolio in the edge supply portfolio is to continue -- will continue to contribute meaningfully to profitable growth for our shareholders. The compute segment is going through a cyclical period where customers are consuming prior investments making this a price-competitive market for now. As we prepare to capture a greater share of AI linked inferencing opportunities, we saw overall demand improved moderately in the second-half and are encouraged in our outlook for this segment. Customer interest in service with ATUs is growing. We are investing in specialized sales resources that can enhance future growth. We also know we must keep our focus on capturing heavy unit in this business, while keeping balancing our operating margin performance. The overall storage market has been sluggish this year. And on our -- even our uneven performance in this segment is in line with most of our peers. However, we are encouraged with three quarters of stable demand. We saw sequential improvement in storage revenue in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in our sales execution capabilities. We recently deployed a large specialized store sales force, including a team devoted to growing our storage IP product mix. We expect our subscription-based offerings and differentiated IP problems like HP Electra will continue to be sources of strong growth to enhance the profitability of this business in the year ahead. We remain focused on advancing our position in Hybrid Cloud. We ended the year with 29,000 customers on our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Customers require a hybrid by design IT estate. They are attracted to our cloud platform because of its experience, flexibility and cost. In the fourth quarter, we closed our largest HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise deal to-date. In addition, we saw more customer demand around our HPE GreenLake SaaS offerings across data protection, observability and sustainability services. Finally, our HPE Financial Services segment continues to deliver strategic sustainable solutions for customers accelerating our strategy and helping to expand earnings for our shareholders. Financing volumes rose year-over-year with a major contribution from efforts to boost our other service volumes through HP GreenLake. Fiscal year 2023 was an important year for HP, one we advanced our strategy and delivered record financial performance for our shareholders through focused execution and operating discipline. I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders in fiscal year 2024 and beyond for three main reasons. First, the work we have done over the last several years to innovate and invest in the right places, places where we have the expertise and the ability to scale has given us a portfolio that I believe stands apart from any other. Second we have weathered cyclical dynamics well. While others have had much more severe shift to make, we have been able to stay the course in bringing our strategy to life because we have made operational improvements and have managed expenses in a disciplined way. And finally, we have been bold in undertaking transformation across the company. The changes we have made to our operating model to strengthen capabilities in our growth segment, focus on our road maps across the portfolio, create new customer experience and reach them in new ways will each pay off next year and beyond. We are set up very well to navigate the current climate with and for our customers and to add significantly to the long-term profitability and value we create for our shareholders. While headwinds remain in certain segments of the IT market, HPE is positioned very well to continue our momentum, and we are lesser focused in areas where we know we can do more to improve our performance. I hope you share my optimism in what HP can achieve in the year ahead. Let me now invite Jeremy to discuss the fourth quarter and specific same year results. So Jeremy, over to you.\nJeremy Cox: Thank you very much, Antonio. We closed FY '23 with another solid performance. Our Q4 results reflect our strategic focus to diversify our business towards higher growth, higher margin areas of the market. The company's transformation we have undertaken several years ago to pivot to edge and cloud is paying off. And with AI exploding in 2023, we see several promising indicators as we look further in 2024 and despite some unevenness in some areas of the IT market where we participate. Q4 performance was highlighted by healthy revenues and gross margins. Revenue grew 5% sequentially in constant currency to $7.4 billion. hitting the midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance range. Year-over-year revenue, however, was down 6% on a difficult compare to Q4 '22, during which significant order book consumption boosted our results. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 34.8%, which was up 170 basis points year-over-year, largely due to the increasing contribution of our Intelligent Edge segment. Let me remind you of the deliberate targeted investment decisions we made in Q4 that I flagged to SAM, which were funded with the better-than-expected OIE performance in the same period. The impact of this investment, along with the strong seasonal growth in HPC and AI resulted in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 9.7%. This is down 60 basis points sequentially and 180 basis points year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to quickly be over in Q1 '24. This led to GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.49 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.52, which was at the high end of our Q4 guidance range of $0.48 to $0.52. Our Q4 free cash flow of $2.3 billion was record-breaking for the company. HPE also delivered an impressive full year performance in FY '23. We delivered revenue growth of 5.5% in constant currency which was at the upper end of our guidance range of 4% to 6%. Currency was a 330 basis point headwind for the year. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2.15 and was also at the high end of our prior guidance and well above our initial guidance from SAM 2022 $1.96 to $2.04. FY '23 free cash flow of $2.2 billion was well above our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Let's now turn to our segment results. As a reminder, all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency and I will discuss the segments in our prior structure. The company is now operating according to our new structure. And as communicated at SAM, we plan to file restated historical financials for the new segments well before we report our Q1 '24 results. In Intelligent Edge, we grew revenue 40% year-over-year in Q4. Demand in our core product was down sequentially on customer digestion, but grew in our software-centric solutions such as our HP Aruba Central cloud management software and in our new TAM opportunities such as our SASE security software suite. Our operating margin of 29.5% was up more than 1,600 basis points year-over-year. While very pleased with this performance, we continue to expect a mid-20% operating margin over time as communicated at SAM 2023. And finally, we're making progress on our order book and expect to be back close to historical normal levels by midyear 2024. In HPC & AI, Q4 revenue grew 38% year-over-year and 41% sequentially. Q4 revenue results included only a modest amount of AI revenue. On a sequential basis, the continued strength in AI demand lifted our order book in the HPC & AI segment to more than $3 billion, despite our significant revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit revenue growth in the segment over the next three years, and we are increasingly confident we will be above trend in FY '24 with GPU supply or gating factor. Our Q4 operating margin was 4.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year and 550 basis points sequentially. While we have much more progress to make, this does illustrate the positive benefits of scale. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key accelerators and long lead times in this segment means that the HPC & AI margins will fluctuate. Storage revenues fell 12% year-over-year on a difficult compare, but rose 3% sequentially. Storage demand has now been flat to up for three straight quarters. HPE Electra revenue grew over 50% year-over-year and it will remain a robust growth contributor in FY '24, supported by growth in file and object storage. HPE Electra is shifting our mix within storage to higher-margin software subscription revenue, which is a key driver of our ARR growth. Q4 storage operating margin of 8.1% was down 730 basis points year-over-year. Headwinds included the deferred revenue impact of the HP Electro subscription software, accelerated investment outpacing year-over-year revenue performance and a high mix of third-party products this quarter. Our investments in product portfolio give us confidence storage will make progress through FY '24 toward our long-term operating profit margin target communicated at SAM 2023 of mid-teens. Compute revenue was down 30% year-over-year on a difficult compare and down 1% sequentially. De elongation and customer digestion, we discussed previously continued to be most prevalent in compute. Declining AUPs from a record high in Q1 '23 was also a meaningful driver. However, two straight quarters of sequential improvement in demand lends further confidence to our FY '24 outlook. Our full-year operating margin of 13.7% exceeded our target range of 11% to 13%, but the operating margin of 9.8% in Q4 was temporarily below the range. Given gross margins remain largely flat sequentially and the sequential demand increases, we continue to expect operating margins to be in the target range for FY '24. HPE Financial Services revenues were flat year-over-year and financing volume was $1.5 billion. Our operating margin of 8.9% was down 220 basis points year-over-year reflecting rapid intra sites that we are offsetting through pricing as well as asset management margins returning to normal as supply challenges ease. Our Q4 loss ratio remained steady at 0.5%. Let's double-click on our portfolio pivot to higher growth, higher margin recurring revenue and in particular, to Intelligent Edge. Even three years ago, the Intelligent Edge segment constituted just 10% of segment revenue. This year, it represented 18%. The operating profit trajectory is even more telling. The Intelligent Edge segment contributed approximately 14% of the segment's operating profit three years ago and was nearly 40% in FY '23. In FY '24, we intend to give you a similar view combining our growth pillars of HPC and AI, hybrid cloud and intelligent edge segments. Within that, we expect the Intelligent Edge segment growth to moderate in the HPC & AI segment growth to accelerate. Robust demand in our hybrid cloud and as-a-service offerings illustrates the durability of our portfolio shift. ARR exceeded $1.3 billion in Q4. This represented 37% year-over-year growth, which is in line with our long-term CAGR target of 35% to 45%. Storage and Intelligent Edge software and services are the fastest-growing components of ARR. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin recurring software and services revenue. Our software and services mix was 68% in the quarter. We expect this mix to increase into the upper 70% range by FY '26. This expansion is driven by the growth of subscription-based software with our products and the increased attach of our HPE operational services, which rose double-digits in Q4. The rising software and services mix is expanding our as-a-service margins. Our as-a-service orders grew 11% year-over-year in Q4 and finished the year up a solid 23% after 68% growth in FY '22. Our cumulative as-a-service TCV has now increased to nearly $13 billion. As ARR is now on a clear path to meaningful scale, we will simplify our as-a-service disclosure from ARR as-a-service orders in TCV to only ARR in FY \u201824. The explosion in AI demand is driving robust growth in our APU orders. Total APU orders, which include APUs in our compute, Cray EX and Cray XD businesses totaled $3.6 billion in FY '23, which is up from the over $3 billion we disclosed at SAM 2023. HPE Cray XD APU orders accelerated in Q3 and in Q4, reaching $2.4 billion for the year. The impressive APU server demand is also evident in our total server demand. APUs represented 25% of total server order dollars in FY '23, up from 10% in the prior year. We will continue to disclose APU orders. However, orders can be easily north of $100 million each, therefore, orders may be lumpy. But the key point is that we are capturing AI demand now and are well positioned for coming demand across the entire AI life cycle from training to tuning to inferencing. Our strategy is delivering top line growth and gross margin expansion. Despite the challenging macro ongoing product digestion and currency headwinds, we still produced one of our highest quarterly revenue figures since 2018, while sustaining our expanded gross margin profile. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin rose 170 basis points year-over-year to 34.8%. And our full year non-GAAP gross margin rose 140 basis points to 35.3%. That's a more than 500 basis point improvement from FY '18. Moving to free cash flow. In Q4, we generated $2.8 billion in cash flow from operations and $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Our $2.2 billion in free cash flow in FY '23 was above the high end of our guidance and up meaningfully from $1.8 billion in FY '22, primarily on improved earnings and net income conversion. We exited FY '23 with a cash conversion cycle of negative four days, which exceeded our expectation for neutral we communicated at SAM. Strong working capital management in Q4 and reduced transformation costs in FY '23 drove an improvement in our conversion of non-GAAP net earnings to free cash flow to approximately 80% in FY '23. Continued progress in FY \u201824 and beyond leads us to expect to reach 90% by FY '26. We reiterate our FY \u201824 free cash flow guidance from SAM of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And we returned over $1 billion in capital to shareholders in FY \u201823, including $421 million in share repurchases. While certain price and volume parameters of our trading program limited us to below our $500 million target in FY \u201823, we reiterate our goal of returning 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders between FY '24 and FY '26. Before we dive into our outlook, let me remind you that we will exclude H3C earnings and gain on sale from our non-GAAP results in FY '24 as we noted at SAM. We continue to expect the process to conclude and the receipt of the cash proceeds in the first-half of calendar 2024. For Q1, we expect revenues in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.3 billion. This incorporates historical seasonality in our overall business, including in the HPC & AI segment after its strong Q4. We expect AI revenue acceleration to drive sequential growth in HPC & AI and total HPE revenue in Q2 '24. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.24 and $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.42 and $0.50. We're reiterating our prior year 2024 guidance of 2% to 4% revenue growth in constant currency. We expect OI&E, which as noted, excludes HCC going forward to be a headwind of approximately $300 million and our non-GAAP structural tax rate to be 15%. Our full-year GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.81 to $2.01 is $0.02 lower than our prior view as a bit of transformation costs slipped into FY '24. We are reiterating our full-year non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.82 to $2.02. We also reiterate free cash flow guidance of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. We continue to believe our FY '24 performance will be weighted to the second-half of the year as GPU supply improves. We are increasing our dividend by 8% in FY '24 and intend to return 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. So to conclude, while there continues to be unevenness in some areas of the IT market, our investment in growing areas of our portfolio is paying off. We are confident in our ability to continue to capture the AI explosion in demand. AI also opens broader customer discussions about the benefits of AI inferencing at the edge and the need to be hybrid by design. Our HPE GreenLake Cloud platform, our AI native portfolio, and our services expertise are perfectly aligned to the needs of our customers that we believe will turn into profitable growth for our shareholders. Now let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just have one on the APU orders of $3.6 billion. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mix between compute, supercomputing and Cray XD. And if you could offer any color on the type of customers that are making this order? Is this your typical enterprise customer? Is it more of a Tier 2 or AI CSP? Any thoughts there would be great.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thanks, Mike. This is Antonio. So pretty much all the orders are in the HPC and AI segment, the vast majority. We saw now in Q4 some uptick in demand in the what I call the traditional compute. But what you have to think about it is AI is a life cycle, right? training to tuning to inferencing. And the products we talk here, whether it's HPE Cray, XD or EX really are on the training side and the tuning side. And so when I think about the type of customers, I think about the model builders, right? So these are unique customers that in the past with generally, we have talk about it. Think about companies like Recussion, Pharmaceutical, Cruso energy, obviously, large language models like Aleph Alpha, Tiger Data or Northern Data, Geo Research and the like. These are big mobile builders, and they need a large amount of computational power. Now when we start seeing as an uptick in the tuning side with enterprises, because generally, they don't tend to build models. They tend to leverage foundation models in the open source or some of these companies provide and then they tune those models with their data, but they want to do it in a private secure and obviously sustainable way. And that's why we have made announcements with NVIDIA, and you can see further announcements later in the week. And then AI inferencing, I call it for using a sport analogy, singles and the doubles, right? So these are maybe a server with eight GPUs or accelerated resorts where they start deploying these models, they have been trained attuned into production and think about where their real-time processing data happen where business transformation takes place or maybe doing some sort of POC or pretraining experiments. And so now we start seeing that increasing. But the vast majority of compute is still CPU centric, and we saw some uptick in the GPUs. But the vast majority of all the APUs that we talked about are in the traditional high density for training and tuning, and that's where our HPE Cray set of platforms plays a big role. And obviously, they also find its way to supercomputing at large scale that we have talked about from TRL Capital and in Aurora, [Indiscernible] and Norsk and the like. Anything you want to add?\nJeremy Cox: The only thing I would just add to that is the supercomputing piece, specific to your question, is less than 10% in the total APU orders in FY '23. The other interesting point to add on to the journey towards inferencing that Antonio mentioned is within compute, although against a very small base, we did see non-Tier 1 customer orders around GPU or APUs for compute increased about 100% in the quarter. So again, against a small base, but an interesting point to see the focus start moving towards that realm.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. And again, only 10% of the POs were consumed in Supercompute rest was all in AI. Okay, thank you, Mike.\nJeffrey Kvaal: Thanks, Mike. Gary, the next question please?\nOperator: The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Antonio, we've seen some networking companies talk about a slowdown and some inventory digestion. You're still delivering very strong growth in edge high 30s. I know you called out a more front-end loaded performance for Edge. But curious how you're thinking about the weight and pace of that business trajectory both on revenue and margin terms as you go through the course of the year?\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. I'm going to talk about demand and then Jeremy can talk about revenue margin, which we were very clear that right, what to expect. Obviously, we have driven a significant growth over the last two years. I think it was the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. That's very impressive, we added $2 billion of revenue in the last 2 years. And obviously, that came with an expanded set of gross margins because of our software and subscription-based models that we have been driving. Traditionally, we think about that has been in the campus and branch, where in our switching or Wi-Fi. But more and more lately, obviously, it's all software-driven and as well as expansion into the new times we discussed at the Security Analyst Meeting, including SD1 and security to create the SSC framework or the SASE framework we talked about it. And going forward, we are also going to add the private 5G, which we discussed. And let's not forget, we have been also gaining momentum in the data center with our offers, which are an extension of our switching portfolio in the data center. So definitely was a quarter-over-quarter slight decline in orders for demand for products in the campus and branch, but we saw strong demand in the software in the security space. And that's why at the securities and analyst meeting with Phil, we talked about this multiple ad adjacency we have add to the platform, and they are all incorporated into the HPE Aruba Central platform, which is part of HPE GreenLake. So again, we are committed to grow revenues next year on the higher pace that we created, again, on the $5.2 billion we just delivered. Albeit you should not expect a 40% growth, obviously. And that's why I want to have Jeremy talk about what we are affirming here in terms of revenue and as well as margins.\nJeremy Cox: Right. Yes. We -- as Antonio mentioned, we did, as Sam mentioned, a slight growth we're expecting year-over-year on a full year basis for Edge. As I think about that, I'd almost break that down into two halves. The first-half, as we mentioned, we do still benefit from a backlog position or an order book position that will go into the first half and help support that revenue performance. And then the second half will be more dependent on demand improvements. and in the areas that Antonio mentioned and the investment areas that were helping drive that expectation. From an operating margin perspective, I would say that I would expect the first half to still benefit from higher operating margins as again, the order book consumption has been at higher price with lower cost. So that's helped drive our operating margin performance, which again this quarter at 29.5% is exceptional. But we would expect to probably more in the second-half, you'll start seeing that operating margin rate get more back towards the mid-20s that we had mentioned at SAM is our expectation for the long-term in this business.\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks very much, Wamsi. Gary, could we have the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. If I look at your -- take the midpoint of your first quarter revenue guide, and I run out normal seasonality I get revenues down about 5% for the year. You've just stated that the edge business is going to be weaker in the second-half, so below normal seasonality. So clearly, you're expecting a huge ramp in HPC in AI over the course of the year? And I'm wondering if you can dimension that or -- are you expecting greater than normal seasonality in the traditional server business? And why would that be? And then finally, can you just comment on total backlog for HPC and AI exiting the quarter, you said it was $3 billion exiting last quarter or greater than $3 billion. What is it today? Thank you.\nJeremy Cox: Toni, this is Jeremy. I'll take those two for you. So you're spot on as we think about next year, we will have a seasonal drop in HPC and AI. That's largely as Q4 really benefited from a meaningful amount of Cray Ex acceptances. And as you know, the time between order and acceptance can be a long period of time and Q4 saw a larger number of acceptances, which helped drive the revenue performance. We'll see a bit of a dip back down in Q1 and then Q2 and the second-half really benefiting from the acceleration in AI, as well as some additional supercomputing business. And so you'll see a pretty significant ramp as we go from Q1 to Q2 and then sustaining at or ramping beyond that in the second-half of the year. And HPC and AI will be a big part of the revenue growth story for FY '24. Your question on the order book total, it landed at just over $3.2 billion, which was slightly above where we landed in Q3. And that really came off the back, though of Q4 revenue performance in HPC & AI up about $350 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And so what happened is you had a runoff of order book from revenue performance in Q4 and then how to rebuild of that order book coming largely from AI demand in Q4 that took it back up to its historical high level of just over $3.2 billion.\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks very much, Toni. Gary?\nOperator: The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess in your prepared remarks, you did make it a point to highlight the uneven demand backdrop that you're seeing. I was wondering if you can flesh that out a bit more in terms of what you're seeing between the different product groups. And particularly when I look at that in contrast to the strong AI demand you're seeing, would you really sort of then see some of the AI demand from enterprises cannibalizing their own spend towards the other product groups? Or is the uneven demand more of inventory correction? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes, sure. I mean no question, we see an explosion in demand in AI. Jeremy just comment on that. And I will say, of that order book that Jeremy just talked about in Q4, [Indiscernible] little was converted in AI. And to the point he made the growth we had in Q4 was driven by the supercomputer acceptances. But we have a very, very large pipeline in front of us, which is very exciting but ultimately it's going to come down to time to revenue based on the GPU availability. But I will say that business is going to continue to be super strong. And clearly, when I speak to customers, which I do more than 50% of my time there is a huge amount of interest in AI and how to accelerate the deployment of a higher cost enterprise, understand that there are challenges, whether it's sustainability challenges, where there are data center capacity, power and cooling and others. And that's why HPE went bold on that front last June to basically make the announcement we're going to offer supercomputing as a public cloud instance so customers can use it as a virtual private cloud. So that we feel very good about it. Green Lake continued to be very strong. Just to be in a context, we added $1 billion in TCV quarter-over-quarter. We added 2,000 customers, and ARR obviously, is a function of the deferred revenue that we materialize over time, but what customers really love about our experience is that it's hybrid by design. They can consume anything from Edge to cloud to HPE GreenLake, where they pay CapEx or OpEx, it doesn't really matter in the end. But they really love the experience. And that's why we're building the AI components into the same platform. So those are two very strong. Edge obviously had tremendous momentum. I think we're going to have the typical adjustments, but that's why we spend a lot of energy and time on adding more capabilities to the edge platform security as one private 5G data center networking, which adds to the momentum, understanding there will be potentially some digestion in the campus and branch. But as Jeremy said, we have very well covered for the first half of 2024. So we have to see that. And then compute, right, is a typical business that goes through this cyclicality, right? So last year, obviously, we had a huge amount of orders we converted the order faster than people expected. And in the back half of this year, we saw sequential demand improvements in units and stable AUPs. And now we start seeing upticks in the mix with AI inferencing, which has these accelerators. But Q3 demand was higher than Q2 and Q4 was higher than Q3. So I think it's fair to say we are stabilized, and we are improving. I would not call it yet a recovery. And on storage, I believe we're going to see some improvements over time because of AI demand, which require file and object and we have a great portfolio with HPE Eletra, and we intend to capitalize on that. But for three consecutive quarters now, we have seen stability and improvement. And in Q4, we saw revenue improvements on a sequential basis. So customers are prioritizing the spend where it makes sense, but ultimately we have a portfolio that can meet their needs, wherever they are and HPE GreenLake is the way we deliver all of this which ultimately for shareholders drives higher margins and higher reported revenues and profit. Sorry?\nJeff Kvaal: Cannibalization.\nAntonio Neri: Cannibalization. Sorry, Jeff, remind me, cannibalization. We have no evidence of that yet. I think that will become clear when the traditional compute CPU-driven returned to some normal levels. But remember, not every customer has deployed cloud across that enterprise. Still quite a bit of journey to go. And there are clear customers assessing what is the best place to deploy that, whether it's in a power cloud or whether it's repatriating on-prem because of the cost or because of data. I think AI is a huge driver of repatriation in my mind because if you have data distributed across multiple states, it's very hard to really train and fine-tune the models when you have data everywhere. And our focus there is really providing them an automated data pipeline with our unified analytics platform. So fundamentally, it's early to say. But so far, in the traditional compute business, we have not seen evidence of cannibalization at this point in time.\nJeff Kvaal: Samik, thank you, Gary.\nOperator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could talk a bit about the trends you're seeing in compute for the non-accelerated platforms. And really, the thing I'm trying to tease out here is sort of this issue of a projects, pulling budget or sucking oxygen on the room versus organizations buying up compute platforms to prepare for AI inferencing and embracing AI as an inferencing element, not just training?\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Simon. Again, maybe I will elaborate a little more to the comments I made before. So we saw Q4 over Q3 and Q3 over Q2 improvement in demand in units. And a lot of that was CPU-driven. Although there is a small base of AI accelerated kind of APUs, if you will, that we saw an increase in Q4. But I will say the unit growth in Q4 was not driven by the APUs, it was driven by a combination of CPUs, the vast majority and some APUs because the base is still very, very small. So definitely, customers are preparing for that. Again, they are all assessing what is the best place to deploy this model. That's why I do believe the inferencing side will accelerate over time, where we have to do some pre-training or POCs or really deploying in production. And I think many customers also will accelerate deployments of tuning solutions on-prem because of the data aspect I talked before. No question is still digesting what they bought last time on the CPU side of the house. But again, we saw some improvements in demand sequentially in units. And then let's remind ourselves that we also, for us, in the industry. We are going to the transition of Sapphire Rapids. And ultimately, we call that the Gen 11 platform. That became now, what, Jeremy? 25% of the mix which...\nJeremy Cox: 53% of orders in Q4.\nAntonio Neri: 53% of the orders in Q4, 25% of the revenue mix. And so that's good for us because, obviously, it drives higher density and obviously, we can attach more options to the same platform. And customers like the sustainability piece of that and the hybrid by design nature of that, which is actually well optimized. And Gen 11, by the way, was conceived to accept any type of processing unit, whether it's a CPU, but it's an APU, including ARM-based solutions or GPU-based solutions. Whether it's in tail on the X86. So that gives us tremendous amount of flexibility. But ultimately, it's not just about the server. It's the software that comes with it. And this is where we spend a lot of time building the partnerships and relationships with NVIDIA. So now you can deploy a tuning or inferencing with the NVIDIA stack and our software as well, all part of HPE GreenLake.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you very much, Simon. Gary?\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Can you just touch on the storage business a little bit. It's been kind of challenged like some of the other businesses on macro. Could you talk a little bit about the outlook for recovery there? And also, if you could just touch on the third-party business there that's kind of impacted gross margin profitability, how does that look to be trending as we look out over the next year or two? Thank you.\nJeremy Cox: Sure. I can take that particularly towards the latter part of that. I think Antonio already hit on some of the demand dynamics, again, where we've seen three quarters of flat to increasing demand, and so some positive trends from that perspective. I think from an operating margin perspective, certainly, we saw a reduction in Q4. That was driven off a combination of several things, including a higher third-party mix that you mentioned. As well as the fact that we see -- we saw some incremental OpEx in this segment and that OpEx as a comparison to the revenue performance in the quarter also put pressure onto that operating margin. However, we do expect a pretty quick recovery there. We -- as we look into Q1, in particular, revenue is not expected to accelerate meaningfully, but we think the mix will improve as far as towards our IP product. And the -- we should see some OpEx moderation and favorability as we go into the quarter coming out of Q4 and some of the investments that we made there. And so I expect to see that get back into a low double-digit kind of area. And then as we work through the quarter, and that IP mix starts to improve more on demand acceleration, then we should start seeing us working back towards our mid-teen target that we identified at SAM for this segment.\nAntonio Neri: I will say also, if you look at our HP Electra product, it's the fastest ramp we ever had in the history of the company. This quarter, this past quarter grew another 50%. But also there is some short-term impact because a portion of that revenue gets deferred because the subscription is softer on the platform. And so that was an intentional strategy because ultimately, the infrastructure is one piece of it, but the operating system and the cloud services that comes with it are actually a subscription to HPE GreenLake. So while we're growing 50%, we are not materializing the full revenue because a portion of that gets deferred at least to over three years. And that's good because ultimately it comes to a significant higher margins for us. But our strategy is to dramatically improve the mix to IT. And you will see more announcement this week in the storage portfolio, all geared to the AI opportunity. We file an object and that will accelerate some of the momentum we have in the storage portfolio.\nOperator: The next question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: I want to ask about ARR, and it was flat quarter-over-quarter, but still up very strongly, 39% year-over-year. Can you walk us through the dynamics why it didn't change in the quarter? You just talked about GreenLake being very strong multiple times. Are there some negatives maybe some cancellations offsetting the growth? Or is that more a pause of the two very, very strong quarters? And lastly, was there much contribution from AI servers in the AR number at this point?\nJeremy Cox: I'll take that. So just on the last point, no, there wasn't any meaningful AI impact, but we do expect that to be an accelerator, particularly in FY '24 as we go to Q2 and towards the second half. That will be a big part of our ARR story, and we expect that to be an accelerator for us in FY '24. On the quarter-over-quarter, this business, similar to what I mentioned on the supercomputing area does have some time between order to revenue recognition. In this case, when ARR begins to be reported. And so I think the sequential story was more about. Early in the year, we had seen more as the backlog had been burning down and some of those deals that have been waiting in the pipeline turning into -- and converting that helped drive and accelerate the ARR through the first 3 quarters. We saw a little bit less of that in Q4. But I don't think that it all as an indication of a slowdown in this space. In fact, between the 35% and 45% kind of CAGR or annual growth, I expect us in FY '24 to see the higher end of that range.\nJeff Kvaal: Sidney, there's some rounding in there that we can talk through. But thank you. Gary, this should be our last question, I think.\nOperator: And our final question will be from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Mary on for Meta Marshall. I just had a question on demand trends. Can you speak to linearity within the quarter and whether pockets of weakness you saw during the quarter changed as the quarter went on?\nAntonio Neri: Yes. I think overall it was more back ended, I would say, in the quarter, we saw strengthening as we went through the weeks. As always said, we have 13 weeks in the quarter, and we saw stronger momentum as we built along the way. And remember what we said the same, right? So as SAM as said year-to-date to October '19, I think, was the sun date. We had $3 billion in cumulative orders both between supercomputer and AI specifically and we ended the year at 3.6%. So in the last 12 days with $600 million in incremental AI orders. That tells you the strong. It was through also for compute and storage. By the way, the last few weeks, call it, three, four, five weeks were stronger than the beginning of the quarter. So I would not make much out of that. Sometimes customers take the time. We still actually live in elongated flow cycles. That's for sure. Customers taking more time to make those decisions. and ultimately issue the POs. But what really is giving me the confidence is the strong pipeline we have ahead of us. That's obvious. And clearly, in AI is significantly stronger than we ever imagined. And the only challenge we have there, then as Jeremy said, right, so it's time to revenue. We really recognize very little revenue in AI in Q4. That's why we expect the acceleration starting in Q2 and beyond as lead times improve and some of the supercomputing also gets accepted. But the reality, 2024 will be the year of AI revenue growth. And then in the edge, obviously, we have the momentum that we talked about in the subscription, the scale of our software and the incremental engines that we have. So overall, it was a typical quarter, but stronger on the back versus the front. Yes. I think we have time for one more.\nAntonio Neri: Let's do one more. Thanks Gary, please. Maybe just one more question.\nOperator: Thanks for the final question. will be from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you guys. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron I just want to ask around AI software. Can you just help us appreciate or understand how your own AI software solutions that you guys talked about at SAM compared to NVIDIA's own AI software suite. I'm just trying to understand is yourself for a complementary or is it more of a substitute? Just how to think about that overall. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: No, great question. And I will say, overall, there is a lot of complementary and there are some places overlap, obviously. But with Jens and the team, we have a clear joint plan to win together in different segments of the market. But let me break it out because we talk about software in general terms, but let's start first at the infrastructure level. we have unique software that allows us to run these supercomputers and AI system, which are cloud native by nature at massive scale. Think about when you run a model you need to start and complete the mobile training. And you have to have unique technologies for checkpoints and making sure that all the compute power is acting as unified system because unlike the public cloud or the cloud, as we know it, you are multiple loads on multiple nodes. In this case, you run one world nodes on multiple nodes. And that's parallel computing as we know it. And ultimately, you need the software to run this at scale. The magic around that is that checkpoint. And then the second piece of that is our networking interconnect fabric which allows us to really connect every accelerated unit to every accelerated unit in a cohesive approach. And that's our Slingshot contingent fabric as we know it. And then on top of that, we have our machine learning development environment. This is where developers and the like use our machine learning development services. to prepare the models to automate the data pipeline. One of the biggest challenges customers have is to prepare the data, data is everywhere, but ultimate bringing in terms sort of one place so you can use data to train the models. And then with NVIDIA, we use their AI enterprise software, including some of the foundation models that they provide order to provide a complete solution. And obviously, we leverage their APUs, call it, GPUs, whether it's H-100-L40-OL4S, A100s in the past and going forward as the announcement we made a supercomputing 2023 in Denver, we are leveraging the grace over Edge 200. So it's a combination, depending on the use case. And we feel pretty good about what we're doing and stay tuned because Thursday, we're going to make further announcements about our partnership with NVIDIA. But it's RAP and IP that makes us together unique and differentiated in the AI space. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. I will appreciate always the time. I know you're busy cover in all the earnings, but I will say just to wrap in fiscal year 2023. Clearly, we demonstrated our strategic investments and the extraordinary innovation across the growth areas of edge, hybrid cloud and even compute for the matter are really resonating with customers. and is helping us tolerate revenue growth and profit diversification. That's why you see the growth in gross margin and profit. And I believe we will continue to capitalize on this growing market opportunities. And I'm confident to continue to increase the returns to our shareholders. And that's why we are raising the dividend for 2024. So thank you for your time today. I wish you all fulfilling end of the calendar year and a special holiday season. Talk to you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today.

Well thanks Jeff and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. In fiscal year 2023, HPE delivered record performance against non-GAAP financial metrics by capitalizing on strong momentum across our portfolio. Our steady execution has resulted in higher revenue, further gross margin expansion, larger operating profit, and record-breaking non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. Our growth engines in Intelligent Edge and HPC and AI, as well as our HPE GreenLake platform, are helping to accelerate our revenue and profit diversification. Importantly, HPE has achieved demonstrable success this year in our ongoing portfolio pivot to higher growth, higher margin areas aligned to the key market megatrends driving customer demand. I will focus my commentary today on our full-year fiscal year 2023 results and allow Jeremy to expand on the fourth quarter and segment results. I'm very proud of all that HPE delivered in fiscal year 2023 for our shareholders, our customers, and our team members. Our performance demonstrates the relevance of our strategy, our portfolio differentiation, and our strong execution. We delivered extraordinary innovation to customers, resulting in share gains in key markets and profitable growth for our company. HPE generated our highest gross margin and highest operating profits since I became CEO, and our highest annual revenue in four years. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow were the largest ever in our company's history. We saw healthy, sustained growth in revenue at $29.1 billion for the full-year, an increase of 5.5% year-over-year in constant currency, a third straight year of revenue [Technical Difficulty] point of our full fiscal year 2023 guidance of 5%. Gross margins exceeded 35%. We also added substantially to our annualized revenue run rate closing fiscal year 2023 with more than $1.3 billion in ARR. That represents a nearly $370 million increase from this time last year. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was up 20 basis points year-over-year to end the year at 10.8%. We have executed well on our addressable market opportunities and exercised prudence with our expenses and obligations. Non-GAAP EPS increased 6.4% year-over-year to $2.15. Improved profitability also means that we have significantly boosted free cash flows, which rose by about $400 million this year to $2.2 billion, and nearly 25% year-over-year increase. Both non-GAAP, EPS, and free cash flow results are record-breaking and well above our fiscal year 2022 sum guidance. In summary, HPE delivered an impressive set of results in fiscal year 2023. With the progress we have made this year and are confidence in generating further value for our shareholders, we are raising our dividends in 2024. HPE is more relevant than ever to our customers. We have deliberately aligned our strategy over the last few years to significant trends in the market around edge, hybrid cloud, and AI. These growth engines align to our customers' interests and where they are targeting their IT spend. Even against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, we saw continued though uneven, demand across our HPE portfolio with a significant acceleration in AI orders. Demand in our AI solutions is exploding. We saw a significant uptick in customer demand in recent quarters for accelerated computing infrastructure and services. In Q4, orders for servers that include accelerated processing units or APUs represented 32% of our total server order mix, up more than 250% from the beginning of fiscal year 2023. APUs, which includes GPU-based servers orders across our business, represented 25% of our total server order mix in fiscal year 2023. Our HPC & AI segment revenue grew 25% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. We ended this fiscal year with the largest HPC & AI order book on record, driven by $3.6 billion in company-wide APU orders. This tops what has been an historically large order book in the third quarter, as demand accelerated for our supercomputing and AI solutions. We anticipate demand next fiscal year will remain very strong. We likely have a large order backlog and the GPU supply is less constrained. Two weeks ago at the Supercomputing Conference, we expanded our collaboration with NVIDIA to announce a turnkey pre-configured supercomputing solution for generative AI to streamline the model development process. The new solution speeds up the training and fine-tuning of AI models using [Indiscernible] data sets. Designed for large enterprises, research institutions, and government organizations, it comprises HPE AI software, our industry-leading supercomputing and storage solutions. Our HPE Slingshot Interconnect Fabric and HPE services, and the Quad NVIDIA Grace Hopper GH200 Superchip. Later this week at HPE Discover Barcelona, we will further expand our NVIDIA partnership with new solutions created for enterprise customers. Also this month, the University of Bristol announced that HPE has been selected to deliver the U.K.'s fastest supercomputer, thanks to our U.K. government investment of GPB225 million intended to make the nation a world leader in AI. The Japan National Institute of Information and Communications Technology recently turned to HPE Cray XD supercomputers to develop an AI-based multilingual communication tool to process, translate, and interpret text and images for 17 languages. And we just announced a partnership with Dark Bite a provider of next-generation high-performance computing green data centers to power its AI cloud service with HPE Cray supercomputers and our purpose-built machine learning software suite. With HPE built supercomputers consistently ranked among monthly top 10 within the top 500 most powerful and sustainable supercomputers, our clear leadership in this space continues to position us well in the AI market. Our Intelligent Edge segment was the largest driver of our revenue and profit growth in fiscal year 2023, making up 18% of our overall revenue and 39% of the segment operating profit. Fiscal year 2023 revenue in this segment increased by 45% to $5.2 billion, while operating margins expanded more than 1,200 basis points year-over-year to 27.3%, demonstrating the relevance of our offering and the payoff of investments over time. A critical part of our intelligent edge portfolio in the edge supply portfolio is to continue -- will continue to contribute meaningfully to profitable growth for our shareholders. The compute segment is going through a cyclical period where customers are consuming prior investments making this a price-competitive market for now. As we prepare to capture a greater share of AI linked inferencing opportunities, we saw overall demand improved moderately in the second-half and are encouraged in our outlook for this segment. Customer interest in service with ATUs is growing. We are investing in specialized sales resources that can enhance future growth. We also know we must keep our focus on capturing heavy unit in this business, while keeping balancing our operating margin performance. The overall storage market has been sluggish this year. And on our -- even our uneven performance in this segment is in line with most of our peers. However, we are encouraged with three quarters of stable demand. We saw sequential improvement in storage revenue in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in our sales execution capabilities. We recently deployed a large specialized store sales force, including a team devoted to growing our storage IP product mix. We expect our subscription-based offerings and differentiated IP problems like HP Electra will continue to be sources of strong growth to enhance the profitability of this business in the year ahead. We remain focused on advancing our position in Hybrid Cloud. We ended the year with 29,000 customers on our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Customers require a hybrid by design IT estate. They are attracted to our cloud platform because of its experience, flexibility and cost. In the fourth quarter, we closed our largest HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise deal to-date. In addition, we saw more customer demand around our HPE GreenLake SaaS offerings across data protection, observability and sustainability services. Finally, our HPE Financial Services segment continues to deliver strategic sustainable solutions for customers accelerating our strategy and helping to expand earnings for our shareholders. Financing volumes rose year-over-year with a major contribution from efforts to boost our other service volumes through HP GreenLake. Fiscal year 2023 was an important year for HP, one we advanced our strategy and delivered record financial performance for our shareholders through focused execution and operating discipline. I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders in fiscal year 2024 and beyond for three main reasons. First, the work we have done over the last several years to innovate and invest in the right places, places where we have the expertise and the ability to scale has given us a portfolio that I believe stands apart from any other. Second we have weathered cyclical dynamics well. While others have had much more severe shift to make, we have been able to stay the course in bringing our strategy to life because we have made operational improvements and have managed expenses in a disciplined way. And finally, we have been bold in undertaking transformation across the company. The changes we have made to our operating model to strengthen capabilities in our growth segment, focus on our road maps across the portfolio, create new customer experience and reach them in new ways will each pay off next year and beyond. We are set up very well to navigate the current climate with and for our customers and to add significantly to the long-term profitability and value we create for our shareholders. While headwinds remain in certain segments of the IT market, HPE is positioned very well to continue our momentum, and we are lesser focused in areas where we know we can do more to improve our performance. I hope you share my optimism in what HP can achieve in the year ahead. Let me now invite Jeremy to discuss the fourth quarter and specific same year results. So Jeremy, over to you. Well, thanks, Mike. This is Antonio. So pretty much all the orders are in the HPC and AI segment, the vast majority. We saw now in Q4 some uptick in demand in the what I call the traditional compute. But what you have to think about it is AI is a life cycle, right? training to tuning to inferencing. And the products we talk here, whether it's HPE Cray, XD or EX really are on the training side and the tuning side. And so when I think about the type of customers, I think about the model builders, right? So these are unique customers that in the past with generally, we have talk about it. Think about companies like Recussion, Pharmaceutical, Cruso energy, obviously, large language models like Aleph Alpha, Tiger Data or Northern Data, Geo Research and the like. These are big mobile builders, and they need a large amount of computational power. Now when we start seeing as an uptick in the tuning side with enterprises, because generally, they don't tend to build models. They tend to leverage foundation models in the open source or some of these companies provide and then they tune those models with their data, but they want to do it in a private secure and obviously sustainable way. And that's why we have made announcements with NVIDIA, and you can see further announcements later in the week. And then AI inferencing, I call it for using a sport analogy, singles and the doubles, right? So these are maybe a server with eight GPUs or accelerated resorts where they start deploying these models, they have been trained attuned into production and think about where their real-time processing data happen where business transformation takes place or maybe doing some sort of POC or pretraining experiments. And so now we start seeing that increasing. But the vast majority of compute is still CPU centric, and we saw some uptick in the GPUs. But the vast majority of all the APUs that we talked about are in the traditional high density for training and tuning, and that's where our HPE Cray set of platforms plays a big role. And obviously, they also find its way to supercomputing at large scale that we have talked about from TRL Capital and in Aurora, [Indiscernible] and Norsk and the like. Anything you want to add? Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. And again, only 10% of the POs were consumed in Supercompute rest was all in AI. Okay, thank you, Mike. Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. I'm going to talk about demand and then Jeremy can talk about revenue margin, which we were very clear that right, what to expect. Obviously, we have driven a significant growth over the last two years. I think it was the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. That's very impressive, we added $2 billion of revenue in the last 2 years. And obviously, that came with an expanded set of gross margins because of our software and subscription-based models that we have been driving. Traditionally, we think about that has been in the campus and branch, where in our switching or Wi-Fi. But more and more lately, obviously, it's all software-driven and as well as expansion into the new times we discussed at the Security Analyst Meeting, including SD1 and security to create the SSC framework or the SASE framework we talked about it. And going forward, we are also going to add the private 5G, which we discussed. And let's not forget, we have been also gaining momentum in the data center with our offers, which are an extension of our switching portfolio in the data center. So definitely was a quarter-over-quarter slight decline in orders for demand for products in the campus and branch, but we saw strong demand in the software in the security space. And that's why at the securities and analyst meeting with Phil, we talked about this multiple ad adjacency we have add to the platform, and they are all incorporated into the HPE Aruba Central platform, which is part of HPE GreenLake. So again, we are committed to grow revenues next year on the higher pace that we created, again, on the $5.2 billion we just delivered. Albeit you should not expect a 40% growth, obviously. And that's why I want to have Jeremy talk about what we are affirming here in terms of revenue and as well as margins. Yes, sure. I mean no question, we see an explosion in demand in AI. Jeremy just comment on that. And I will say, of that order book that Jeremy just talked about in Q4, [Indiscernible] little was converted in AI. And to the point he made the growth we had in Q4 was driven by the supercomputer acceptances. But we have a very, very large pipeline in front of us, which is very exciting but ultimately it's going to come down to time to revenue based on the GPU availability. But I will say that business is going to continue to be super strong. And clearly, when I speak to customers, which I do more than 50% of my time there is a huge amount of interest in AI and how to accelerate the deployment of a higher cost enterprise, understand that there are challenges, whether it's sustainability challenges, where there are data center capacity, power and cooling and others. And that's why HPE went bold on that front last June to basically make the announcement we're going to offer supercomputing as a public cloud instance so customers can use it as a virtual private cloud. So that we feel very good about it. Green Lake continued to be very strong. Just to be in a context, we added $1 billion in TCV quarter-over-quarter. We added 2,000 customers, and ARR obviously, is a function of the deferred revenue that we materialize over time, but what customers really love about our experience is that it's hybrid by design. They can consume anything from Edge to cloud to HPE GreenLake, where they pay CapEx or OpEx, it doesn't really matter in the end. But they really love the experience. And that's why we're building the AI components into the same platform. So those are two very strong. Edge obviously had tremendous momentum. I think we're going to have the typical adjustments, but that's why we spend a lot of energy and time on adding more capabilities to the edge platform security as one private 5G data center networking, which adds to the momentum, understanding there will be potentially some digestion in the campus and branch. But as Jeremy said, we have very well covered for the first half of 2024. So we have to see that. And then compute, right, is a typical business that goes through this cyclicality, right? So last year, obviously, we had a huge amount of orders we converted the order faster than people expected. And in the back half of this year, we saw sequential demand improvements in units and stable AUPs. And now we start seeing upticks in the mix with AI inferencing, which has these accelerators. But Q3 demand was higher than Q2 and Q4 was higher than Q3. So I think it's fair to say we are stabilized, and we are improving. I would not call it yet a recovery. And on storage, I believe we're going to see some improvements over time because of AI demand, which require file and object and we have a great portfolio with HPE Eletra, and we intend to capitalize on that. But for three consecutive quarters now, we have seen stability and improvement. And in Q4, we saw revenue improvements on a sequential basis. So customers are prioritizing the spend where it makes sense, but ultimately we have a portfolio that can meet their needs, wherever they are and HPE GreenLake is the way we deliver all of this which ultimately for shareholders drives higher margins and higher reported revenues and profit. Sorry? Cannibalization. Sorry, Jeff, remind me, cannibalization. We have no evidence of that yet. I think that will become clear when the traditional compute CPU-driven returned to some normal levels. But remember, not every customer has deployed cloud across that enterprise. Still quite a bit of journey to go. And there are clear customers assessing what is the best place to deploy that, whether it's in a power cloud or whether it's repatriating on-prem because of the cost or because of data. I think AI is a huge driver of repatriation in my mind because if you have data distributed across multiple states, it's very hard to really train and fine-tune the models when you have data everywhere. And our focus there is really providing them an automated data pipeline with our unified analytics platform. So fundamentally, it's early to say. But so far, in the traditional compute business, we have not seen evidence of cannibalization at this point in time. Yes. Thanks, Simon. Again, maybe I will elaborate a little more to the comments I made before. So we saw Q4 over Q3 and Q3 over Q2 improvement in demand in units. And a lot of that was CPU-driven. Although there is a small base of AI accelerated kind of APUs, if you will, that we saw an increase in Q4. But I will say the unit growth in Q4 was not driven by the APUs, it was driven by a combination of CPUs, the vast majority and some APUs because the base is still very, very small. So definitely, customers are preparing for that. Again, they are all assessing what is the best place to deploy this model. That's why I do believe the inferencing side will accelerate over time, where we have to do some pre-training or POCs or really deploying in production. And I think many customers also will accelerate deployments of tuning solutions on-prem because of the data aspect I talked before. No question is still digesting what they bought last time on the CPU side of the house. But again, we saw some improvements in demand sequentially in units. And then let's remind ourselves that we also, for us, in the industry. We are going to the transition of Sapphire Rapids. And ultimately, we call that the Gen 11 platform. That became now, what, Jeremy? 25% of the mix which... 53% of the orders in Q4, 25% of the revenue mix. And so that's good for us because, obviously, it drives higher density and obviously, we can attach more options to the same platform. And customers like the sustainability piece of that and the hybrid by design nature of that, which is actually well optimized. And Gen 11, by the way, was conceived to accept any type of processing unit, whether it's a CPU, but it's an APU, including ARM-based solutions or GPU-based solutions. Whether it's in tail on the X86. So that gives us tremendous amount of flexibility. But ultimately, it's not just about the server. It's the software that comes with it. And this is where we spend a lot of time building the partnerships and relationships with NVIDIA. So now you can deploy a tuning or inferencing with the NVIDIA stack and our software as well, all part of HPE GreenLake. I will say also, if you look at our HP Electra product, it's the fastest ramp we ever had in the history of the company. This quarter, this past quarter grew another 50%. But also there is some short-term impact because a portion of that revenue gets deferred because the subscription is softer on the platform. And so that was an intentional strategy because ultimately, the infrastructure is one piece of it, but the operating system and the cloud services that comes with it are actually a subscription to HPE GreenLake. So while we're growing 50%, we are not materializing the full revenue because a portion of that gets deferred at least to over three years. And that's good because ultimately it comes to a significant higher margins for us. But our strategy is to dramatically improve the mix to IT. And you will see more announcement this week in the storage portfolio, all geared to the AI opportunity. We file an object and that will accelerate some of the momentum we have in the storage portfolio. Yes. I think overall it was more back ended, I would say, in the quarter, we saw strengthening as we went through the weeks. As always said, we have 13 weeks in the quarter, and we saw stronger momentum as we built along the way. And remember what we said the same, right? So as SAM as said year-to-date to October '19, I think, was the sun date. We had $3 billion in cumulative orders both between supercomputer and AI specifically and we ended the year at 3.6%. So in the last 12 days with $600 million in incremental AI orders. That tells you the strong. It was through also for compute and storage. By the way, the last few weeks, call it, three, four, five weeks were stronger than the beginning of the quarter. So I would not make much out of that. Sometimes customers take the time. We still actually live in elongated flow cycles. That's for sure. Customers taking more time to make those decisions. and ultimately issue the POs. But what really is giving me the confidence is the strong pipeline we have ahead of us. That's obvious. And clearly, in AI is significantly stronger than we ever imagined. And the only challenge we have there, then as Jeremy said, right, so it's time to revenue. We really recognize very little revenue in AI in Q4. That's why we expect the acceleration starting in Q2 and beyond as lead times improve and some of the supercomputing also gets accepted. But the reality, 2024 will be the year of AI revenue growth. And then in the edge, obviously, we have the momentum that we talked about in the subscription, the scale of our software and the incremental engines that we have. So overall, it was a typical quarter, but stronger on the back versus the front. Yes. I think we have time for one more. Let's do one more. Thanks Gary, please. Maybe just one more question. No, great question. And I will say, overall, there is a lot of complementary and there are some places overlap, obviously. But with Jens and the team, we have a clear joint plan to win together in different segments of the market. But let me break it out because we talk about software in general terms, but let's start first at the infrastructure level. we have unique software that allows us to run these supercomputers and AI system, which are cloud native by nature at massive scale. Think about when you run a model you need to start and complete the mobile training. And you have to have unique technologies for checkpoints and making sure that all the compute power is acting as unified system because unlike the public cloud or the cloud, as we know it, you are multiple loads on multiple nodes. In this case, you run one world nodes on multiple nodes. And that's parallel computing as we know it. And ultimately, you need the software to run this at scale. The magic around that is that checkpoint. And then the second piece of that is our networking interconnect fabric which allows us to really connect every accelerated unit to every accelerated unit in a cohesive approach. And that's our Slingshot contingent fabric as we know it. And then on top of that, we have our machine learning development environment. This is where developers and the like use our machine learning development services. to prepare the models to automate the data pipeline. One of the biggest challenges customers have is to prepare the data, data is everywhere, but ultimate bringing in terms sort of one place so you can use data to train the models. And then with NVIDIA, we use their AI enterprise software, including some of the foundation models that they provide order to provide a complete solution. And obviously, we leverage their APUs, call it, GPUs, whether it's H-100-L40-OL4S, A100s in the past and going forward as the announcement we made a supercomputing 2023 in Denver, we are leveraging the grace over Edge 200. So it's a combination, depending on the use case. And we feel pretty good about what we're doing and stay tuned because Thursday, we're going to make further announcements about our partnership with NVIDIA. But it's RAP and IP that makes us together unique and differentiated in the AI space. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. I will appreciate always the time. I know you're busy cover in all the earnings, but I will say just to wrap in fiscal year 2023. Clearly, we demonstrated our strategic investments and the extraordinary innovation across the growth areas of edge, hybrid cloud and even compute for the matter are really resonating with customers. and is helping us tolerate revenue growth and profit diversification. That's why you see the growth in gross margin and profit. And I believe we will continue to capitalize on this growing market opportunities. And I'm confident to continue to increase the returns to our shareholders. And that's why we are raising the dividend for 2024. So thank you for your time today. I wish you all fulfilling end of the calendar year and a special holiday season. Talk to you soon."

            "name": "Jeremy Cox",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. We closed FY '23 with another solid performance. Our Q4 results reflect our strategic focus to diversify our business towards higher growth, higher margin areas of the market. The company's transformation we have undertaken several years ago to pivot to edge and cloud is paying off. And with AI exploding in 2023, we see several promising indicators as we look further in 2024 and despite some unevenness in some areas of the IT market where we participate. Q4 performance was highlighted by healthy revenues and gross margins. Revenue grew 5% sequentially in constant currency to $7.4 billion. hitting the midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance range. Year-over-year revenue, however, was down 6% on a difficult compare to Q4 '22, during which significant order book consumption boosted our results. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 34.8%, which was up 170 basis points year-over-year, largely due to the increasing contribution of our Intelligent Edge segment. Let me remind you of the deliberate targeted investment decisions we made in Q4 that I flagged to SAM, which were funded with the better-than-expected OIE performance in the same period. The impact of this investment, along with the strong seasonal growth in HPC and AI resulted in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 9.7%. This is down 60 basis points sequentially and 180 basis points year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to quickly be over in Q1 '24. This led to GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.49 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.52, which was at the high end of our Q4 guidance range of $0.48 to $0.52. Our Q4 free cash flow of $2.3 billion was record-breaking for the company. HPE also delivered an impressive full year performance in FY '23. We delivered revenue growth of 5.5% in constant currency which was at the upper end of our guidance range of 4% to 6%. Currency was a 330 basis point headwind for the year. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2.15 and was also at the high end of our prior guidance and well above our initial guidance from SAM 2022 $1.96 to $2.04. FY '23 free cash flow of $2.2 billion was well above our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Let's now turn to our segment results. As a reminder, all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency and I will discuss the segments in our prior structure. The company is now operating according to our new structure. And as communicated at SAM, we plan to file restated historical financials for the new segments well before we report our Q1 '24 results. In Intelligent Edge, we grew revenue 40% year-over-year in Q4. Demand in our core product was down sequentially on customer digestion, but grew in our software-centric solutions such as our HP Aruba Central cloud management software and in our new TAM opportunities such as our SASE security software suite. Our operating margin of 29.5% was up more than 1,600 basis points year-over-year. While very pleased with this performance, we continue to expect a mid-20% operating margin over time as communicated at SAM 2023. And finally, we're making progress on our order book and expect to be back close to historical normal levels by midyear 2024. In HPC & AI, Q4 revenue grew 38% year-over-year and 41% sequentially. Q4 revenue results included only a modest amount of AI revenue. On a sequential basis, the continued strength in AI demand lifted our order book in the HPC & AI segment to more than $3 billion, despite our significant revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit revenue growth in the segment over the next three years, and we are increasingly confident we will be above trend in FY '24 with GPU supply or gating factor. Our Q4 operating margin was 4.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year and 550 basis points sequentially. While we have much more progress to make, this does illustrate the positive benefits of scale. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key accelerators and long lead times in this segment means that the HPC & AI margins will fluctuate. Storage revenues fell 12% year-over-year on a difficult compare, but rose 3% sequentially. Storage demand has now been flat to up for three straight quarters. HPE Electra revenue grew over 50% year-over-year and it will remain a robust growth contributor in FY '24, supported by growth in file and object storage. HPE Electra is shifting our mix within storage to higher-margin software subscription revenue, which is a key driver of our ARR growth. Q4 storage operating margin of 8.1% was down 730 basis points year-over-year. Headwinds included the deferred revenue impact of the HP Electro subscription software, accelerated investment outpacing year-over-year revenue performance and a high mix of third-party products this quarter. Our investments in product portfolio give us confidence storage will make progress through FY '24 toward our long-term operating profit margin target communicated at SAM 2023 of mid-teens. Compute revenue was down 30% year-over-year on a difficult compare and down 1% sequentially. De elongation and customer digestion, we discussed previously continued to be most prevalent in compute. Declining AUPs from a record high in Q1 '23 was also a meaningful driver. However, two straight quarters of sequential improvement in demand lends further confidence to our FY '24 outlook. Our full-year operating margin of 13.7% exceeded our target range of 11% to 13%, but the operating margin of 9.8% in Q4 was temporarily below the range. Given gross margins remain largely flat sequentially and the sequential demand increases, we continue to expect operating margins to be in the target range for FY '24. HPE Financial Services revenues were flat year-over-year and financing volume was $1.5 billion. Our operating margin of 8.9% was down 220 basis points year-over-year reflecting rapid intra sites that we are offsetting through pricing as well as asset management margins returning to normal as supply challenges ease. Our Q4 loss ratio remained steady at 0.5%. Let's double-click on our portfolio pivot to higher growth, higher margin recurring revenue and in particular, to Intelligent Edge. Even three years ago, the Intelligent Edge segment constituted just 10% of segment revenue. This year, it represented 18%. The operating profit trajectory is even more telling. The Intelligent Edge segment contributed approximately 14% of the segment's operating profit three years ago and was nearly 40% in FY '23. In FY '24, we intend to give you a similar view combining our growth pillars of HPC and AI, hybrid cloud and intelligent edge segments. Within that, we expect the Intelligent Edge segment growth to moderate in the HPC & AI segment growth to accelerate. Robust demand in our hybrid cloud and as-a-service offerings illustrates the durability of our portfolio shift. ARR exceeded $1.3 billion in Q4. This represented 37% year-over-year growth, which is in line with our long-term CAGR target of 35% to 45%. Storage and Intelligent Edge software and services are the fastest-growing components of ARR. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin recurring software and services revenue. Our software and services mix was 68% in the quarter. We expect this mix to increase into the upper 70% range by FY '26. This expansion is driven by the growth of subscription-based software with our products and the increased attach of our HPE operational services, which rose double-digits in Q4. The rising software and services mix is expanding our as-a-service margins. Our as-a-service orders grew 11% year-over-year in Q4 and finished the year up a solid 23% after 68% growth in FY '22. Our cumulative as-a-service TCV has now increased to nearly $13 billion. As ARR is now on a clear path to meaningful scale, we will simplify our as-a-service disclosure from ARR as-a-service orders in TCV to only ARR in FY \u201824. The explosion in AI demand is driving robust growth in our APU orders. Total APU orders, which include APUs in our compute, Cray EX and Cray XD businesses totaled $3.6 billion in FY '23, which is up from the over $3 billion we disclosed at SAM 2023. HPE Cray XD APU orders accelerated in Q3 and in Q4, reaching $2.4 billion for the year. The impressive APU server demand is also evident in our total server demand. APUs represented 25% of total server order dollars in FY '23, up from 10% in the prior year. We will continue to disclose APU orders. However, orders can be easily north of $100 million each, therefore, orders may be lumpy. But the key point is that we are capturing AI demand now and are well positioned for coming demand across the entire AI life cycle from training to tuning to inferencing. Our strategy is delivering top line growth and gross margin expansion. Despite the challenging macro ongoing product digestion and currency headwinds, we still produced one of our highest quarterly revenue figures since 2018, while sustaining our expanded gross margin profile. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin rose 170 basis points year-over-year to 34.8%. And our full year non-GAAP gross margin rose 140 basis points to 35.3%. That's a more than 500 basis point improvement from FY '18. Moving to free cash flow. In Q4, we generated $2.8 billion in cash flow from operations and $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Our $2.2 billion in free cash flow in FY '23 was above the high end of our guidance and up meaningfully from $1.8 billion in FY '22, primarily on improved earnings and net income conversion. We exited FY '23 with a cash conversion cycle of negative four days, which exceeded our expectation for neutral we communicated at SAM. Strong working capital management in Q4 and reduced transformation costs in FY '23 drove an improvement in our conversion of non-GAAP net earnings to free cash flow to approximately 80% in FY '23. Continued progress in FY \u201824 and beyond leads us to expect to reach 90% by FY '26. We reiterate our FY \u201824 free cash flow guidance from SAM of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And we returned over $1 billion in capital to shareholders in FY \u201823, including $421 million in share repurchases. While certain price and volume parameters of our trading program limited us to below our $500 million target in FY \u201823, we reiterate our goal of returning 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders between FY '24 and FY '26. Before we dive into our outlook, let me remind you that we will exclude H3C earnings and gain on sale from our non-GAAP results in FY '24 as we noted at SAM. We continue to expect the process to conclude and the receipt of the cash proceeds in the first-half of calendar 2024. For Q1, we expect revenues in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.3 billion. This incorporates historical seasonality in our overall business, including in the HPC & AI segment after its strong Q4. We expect AI revenue acceleration to drive sequential growth in HPC & AI and total HPE revenue in Q2 '24. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.24 and $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.42 and $0.50. We're reiterating our prior year 2024 guidance of 2% to 4% revenue growth in constant currency. We expect OI&E, which as noted, excludes HCC going forward to be a headwind of approximately $300 million and our non-GAAP structural tax rate to be 15%. Our full-year GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.81 to $2.01 is $0.02 lower than our prior view as a bit of transformation costs slipped into FY '24. We are reiterating our full-year non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.82 to $2.02. We also reiterate free cash flow guidance of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. We continue to believe our FY '24 performance will be weighted to the second-half of the year as GPU supply improves. We are increasing our dividend by 8% in FY '24 and intend to return 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. So to conclude, while there continues to be unevenness in some areas of the IT market, our investment in growing areas of our portfolio is paying off. We are confident in our ability to continue to capture the AI explosion in demand. AI also opens broader customer discussions about the benefits of AI inferencing at the edge and the need to be hybrid by design. Our HPE GreenLake Cloud platform, our AI native portfolio, and our services expertise are perfectly aligned to the needs of our customers that we believe will turn into profitable growth for our shareholders. Now let's open it up for questions. The only thing I would just add to that is the supercomputing piece, specific to your question, is less than 10% in the total APU orders in FY '23. The other interesting point to add on to the journey towards inferencing that Antonio mentioned is within compute, although against a very small base, we did see non-Tier 1 customer orders around GPU or APUs for compute increased about 100% in the quarter. So again, against a small base, but an interesting point to see the focus start moving towards that realm. Right. Yes. We -- as Antonio mentioned, we did, as Sam mentioned, a slight growth we're expecting year-over-year on a full year basis for Edge. As I think about that, I'd almost break that down into two halves. The first-half, as we mentioned, we do still benefit from a backlog position or an order book position that will go into the first half and help support that revenue performance. And then the second half will be more dependent on demand improvements. and in the areas that Antonio mentioned and the investment areas that were helping drive that expectation. From an operating margin perspective, I would say that I would expect the first half to still benefit from higher operating margins as again, the order book consumption has been at higher price with lower cost. So that's helped drive our operating margin performance, which again this quarter at 29.5% is exceptional. But we would expect to probably more in the second-half, you'll start seeing that operating margin rate get more back towards the mid-20s that we had mentioned at SAM is our expectation for the long-term in this business. Toni, this is Jeremy. I'll take those two for you. So you're spot on as we think about next year, we will have a seasonal drop in HPC and AI. That's largely as Q4 really benefited from a meaningful amount of Cray Ex acceptances. And as you know, the time between order and acceptance can be a long period of time and Q4 saw a larger number of acceptances, which helped drive the revenue performance. We'll see a bit of a dip back down in Q1 and then Q2 and the second-half really benefiting from the acceleration in AI, as well as some additional supercomputing business. And so you'll see a pretty significant ramp as we go from Q1 to Q2 and then sustaining at or ramping beyond that in the second-half of the year. And HPC and AI will be a big part of the revenue growth story for FY '24. Your question on the order book total, it landed at just over $3.2 billion, which was slightly above where we landed in Q3. And that really came off the back, though of Q4 revenue performance in HPC & AI up about $350 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And so what happened is you had a runoff of order book from revenue performance in Q4 and then how to rebuild of that order book coming largely from AI demand in Q4 that took it back up to its historical high level of just over $3.2 billion. 53% of orders in Q4. Sure. I can take that particularly towards the latter part of that. I think Antonio already hit on some of the demand dynamics, again, where we've seen three quarters of flat to increasing demand, and so some positive trends from that perspective. I think from an operating margin perspective, certainly, we saw a reduction in Q4. That was driven off a combination of several things, including a higher third-party mix that you mentioned. As well as the fact that we see -- we saw some incremental OpEx in this segment and that OpEx as a comparison to the revenue performance in the quarter also put pressure onto that operating margin. However, we do expect a pretty quick recovery there. We -- as we look into Q1, in particular, revenue is not expected to accelerate meaningfully, but we think the mix will improve as far as towards our IP product. And the -- we should see some OpEx moderation and favorability as we go into the quarter coming out of Q4 and some of the investments that we made there. And so I expect to see that get back into a low double-digit kind of area. And then as we work through the quarter, and that IP mix starts to improve more on demand acceleration, then we should start seeing us working back towards our mid-teen target that we identified at SAM for this segment. I'll take that. So just on the last point, no, there wasn't any meaningful AI impact, but we do expect that to be an accelerator, particularly in FY '24 as we go to Q2 and towards the second half. That will be a big part of our ARR story, and we expect that to be an accelerator for us in FY '24. On the quarter-over-quarter, this business, similar to what I mentioned on the supercomputing area does have some time between order to revenue recognition. In this case, when ARR begins to be reported. And so I think the sequential story was more about. Early in the year, we had seen more as the backlog had been burning down and some of those deals that have been waiting in the pipeline turning into -- and converting that helped drive and accelerate the ARR through the first 3 quarters. We saw a little bit less of that in Q4. But I don't think that it all as an indication of a slowdown in this space. In fact, between the 35% and 45% kind of CAGR or annual growth, I expect us in FY '24 to see the higher end of that range."

Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon. Thank you, everyone, for joining today. HPE delivered another solid quarter. We again increased our revenue, gross margin and earnings per share year-over-year and delivered strong free cash flow. Our results are being driven by our intentional ongoing mix shift to higher growth, higher margin parts of our portfolio that are critical priorities to customers. Our success in shifting the portfolio delivered a 120 basis points year-over-year non-GAAP gross margin expansion, driven by exceptional performance in areas like the Intelligent Edge, where revenue has set its fifth consecutive record quarter, and HPE GreenLake, which continue to accelerate our strategic pivot, generating higher recurring revenue and gross profit across our four product segments, driven by the increased mix of high margin software and services. In Q3, our Intelligent Edge business contributed 20% of our total company revenue. It is now the largest source of HPE's operating profit at 49% of our total segment operating profit. Our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform is accelerating our other service pivots, delivering an annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, of $1.3 billion, a 48% increase year-over-year. Our strategic shift towards edge, hybrid cloud and AI delivered through our HPE GreenLake cloud platform is working, and we are delivering on our financial commitments. Because of our momentum and strong execution throughout this fiscal year, and once again, we are raising our full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance. GAAP for full year diluted net earnings per share guidance will remain unchanged. For non-GAAP, diluted net earnings per share we are increasing to $2.30 at the midpoint, while maintaining both our full year constant currency revenue growth guidance of 4% to 6% and full year free cash flow guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. We will provide more details later in our call today, including on a GAAP basis. Our view of the macro environment remains unchanged from recent months. Customers continue to prioritize their data-first digital transformation, despite some reservations about the macroeconomic environment for the future. While the broader IT market is still pressured, demand for our products and services grew sequentially in the third quarter across all key segments of our business, driven by high-growth areas like AI and HPE GreenLake. We continue to see strong interest in our AI and supercomputing offerings from enterprise customers who are incorporating artificial intelligence into their businesses. This is translating into significantly higher demand for our HPC & AI business segment as customers discover HPE's unique capabilities to power unprecedented level of performance for AI at scale, including using our market-leading supercomputers built with sustainability in mind to train and tune their AI models. Total HPE revenue during the third quarter increased 3.5% year-over-year to $7 billion, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.9%, very close to the record level we achieved in the second quarter. Higher profitability in the third quarter compared to last year also corresponded to an increase in non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, which was $0.49, up 2% year-over-year. And we generated $955 million in free cash flow, an increase of nearly $370 million. The HPE GreenLake cloud platform is a key driver of financial performance, with our hybrid cloud offerings through the platform continue to attract new customers and compel existing customers to expand their contracts. HPE GreenLake orders rose 122% year-over-year, resulting in a nearly $1.5 billion increase in our as-a-service total contract value since last quarter. Our cumulative booked total contract value now stands at just under $12 billion. The scale and the strength of HPE GreenLake is evident; it supports 27,000 unique customer logos and 3.4 million connected devices, and more than 1,100 partners sell HPE GreenLake, one of the largest partner ecosystems selling as-a-service offerings in the industry. As we grow our ARR, we are also increasing the share of high-margin software and services. Software and services increased 2 percentage points sequentially to 68% of the total ARR mix, compared to 66% in the second quarter, with ongoing contributions from SaaS offerings tied to our HPE Ezmeral Software, storage and HPE Aruba Networking, our operational Services and OpsRamp, our recent acquisition. We are well-positioned to continue to grow the software and services mix within our ARR. For example, we saw a double-digit increase in demand with HPE operational services this quarter, which will contribute to future recurring revenues. The impressive gross margin in our as-a-service recurring revenues helped lift our already-strong overall company gross margin this quarter. These results demonstrate the relevance of our differentiated HPE GreenLake value proposition of providing one unified hybrid cloud experience to empower customers to access, analyze and extract value from their data, no matter where it lies, at the edge, in the colos or data center and in the public cloud. Now I would like to highlight a few important takeaways in our business segment results. First, as I said earlier, HPE's performance in the Intelligent Edge segment was particularly noteworthy in the quarter. Intelligent Edge revenue increased 53% year-over-year and operating profit more than doubled in another exceptional quarter for this business segment. I'm particularly pleased that our Intelligent Edge SaaS revenues continued to climb double-digits. We are gaining share, benefiting from improved availability of supply, high shipment volume and a strong response to our SaaS edge offerings in terms of both demand and revenue. Momentum in Intelligent Edge was consistent around the globe, with revenue increasing by double-digits in all regions in the third quarter. One example is the University of Maryland, which wanted a stronger cloud-based policy-driven wired and wireless network that could provide improved automation, better device visibility and easier and more secure access for students, faculty and staff as they are returning to campus. The University selected HPE Aruba Networking for a campus-wide refresh to enhance the flexibility, visibility and security of its network through HPE Aruba ClearPass, our SaaS platform to onboard new devices, grant varying access levels and keep network secure. The HPC & AI business segment saw a way for demand acceleration in the quarter, as we converted on AI deal opportunities and shipped orders that leverage our unique end-to-end AI value proposition, from training to tuning to inference. As a result, we exited the quarter with the largest HPC & AI order book we have ever had. Our AI momentum also helped grow our total HPE order book, which is now at more than 2 times pre-pandemic levels, driven by exceptional customer demand for our AI solutions and sequential demand improvements across our four product segments. Only HPE can combine our unique AI software and slingshot networking fabric. HPE services offerings and market-leading sustainable supercomputers. Our open ecosystem of AI suppliers is also an advantage for customers, who are turning to us for a full-spectrum of enterprise AI workloads and use cases, spanning large-scale model development, training, tune and inferencing. Through the UK's GW4 Alliance of four UK research universities, HPE won a contract from the UK Research and Innovation to develop Isambard 3, a supercomputer that leverages the latest HPE Cray XD supercomputers, HPE Slingshot Interconnect and NVIDIA Grace CPU -- GPU Superchip. The system will provide researchers engineers and data scientists purpose-built capabilities to train AI models and accelerate research in clean energy, drug discovery, medical diagnosis and astrophysics. In addition, we were selected by Tokyo Institute of Technology Global Scientific Information and Computing Center to build its next-generation supercomputer, which is called TSUBAME 4.0, which includes AMD CPUs and NVIDIA's GPUs to accelerate AI-driven scientific discovery in medicine, material science and climate research. Recursion Pharmaceuticals is a leading public tech-bio company that uses advancement in AI to accelerate and industrialize the discovery of new drugs. Recursion turned to HPE's AI software to scale its foundation model efforts, significantly speed up training across its more than 25 petabytes of biological and chemical data and improve team collaboration. We are seeing AI projects generate exciting results on our supercomputers. For example, the LUMI supercomputer built by HPE with AMD CPUs and GPUs is the fastest system in Europe and the third fastest in the world. It has enabled generative AI projects, such as creating the world's largest finished language model, and it has helped researchers apply AI for early detection of diagnosis of breast and prostate cancers. We continue to make progress in ushering in the area of exascale supercomputing, which enables unprecedented scale and performance for larger AI models, such as generative AI. This quarter, HPE in collaboration with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory started to build and test El Capitan, one of the largest upcoming exascale supercomputers. El Capitan, which uses AMD CPUs and GPUs is expected to reach two exaFLOPS of peak performance, will allow researchers to apply AI to advance U.S. national security and breakthroughs in medical and drug research initiatives. We are seeing demand improving in both our Storage and Compute segments. Storage demand was solid year-over-year with a cloud-native HPE Alletra portfolio recording triple-digit revenue growth. Storage SaaS revenue also increased double digits as we continue to intentionally drive more of HPE's Alletra own IP through HPE GreenLake. Compute performed well considering the sector ongoing cyclicality. We saw sequential unit demand increase in the quarter. One area where we anticipate demand picking up in the coming quarters is customers seeking a solution to run AI inference workloads. Our new HPE ProLiant Gen 11 servers optimized for AI workloads are well positioned for this growing customer need. During the third quarter, we started shipping these servers, which boosted AI inference performance by more than 5x over previous models. And just last week, we expanded our portfolio for enterprise tuning and inference solutions with NVIDIA and VMware to accelerate their customers' generative AI deployments. To round out our major segments, in HPE Financial Services, revenue climbed 7% year-over-year and financing volume ticked up 6%. HPE Financial Services continues to be strategically important as we continue to ramp up our as-a-service volumes through HPE GreenLake. We continue to strengthen our innovation from edge to cloud, position HPE well for the future. In June, we hosted more than 10,000 customers and partners at our annual HPE Discovery event, where we unveiled exciting new edge, hybrid cloud and AI solutions to help customers achieve their business goals and gain competitive advantage. At HPE Discover, we announced we have entered the AI public cloud market with HPE GreenLake for large language models. Available at the end of this calendar year, the offering will enable a wide variety of enterprise customers to privately train and tune their data, using our industry-leading AI sustainable supercomputer infrastructure and software. We also extended our hybrid cloud leadership at HPE Discover with new HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud services, including our new SaaS-based IT Operations Management solution from our recent acquisition of OpsRamp. And to drive faster, easier and more sustainable ways to deploy our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud solutions outside of the data center, we expanded our partnership with colo market leader Equinix, which enable customers to go from [quarter] (ph) production in days by using our HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise stack. Two new HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise customers are global logistics solutions leader, Swisslog, and global media -- global company [Media House] (ph). Swisslog chose HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise to help accelerate their automation of its warehouse centers with a cutting-edge on-premises private cloud that could provide rapid, secure and controlled service delivery. Media House, which owns more than 30 different news brands in Europe, wanted a modern on-premise private cloud to accelerate its digital transformation and better leverage data to attract and retain subscribers with a more personalized customer experience. HPE GreenLake will help the company achieve operational agility, mitigate risk and address IT skills gap and advance its digital priorities. At HPE Discover, we expanded our HPE GreenLake private cloud portfolio with HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business Edition, a new offering that allows customers to spin a virtual machine across hybrid clouds on demand. This new offer is an extension of a hyperconverged portfolio with automation and hybrid cloud software built into the private cloud solution. Early in the quarter, we previewed a new sustainability dashboard on the HPE GreenLake platform alongside a comprehensive portfolio of sustainability services designed to help organizations reduce the carbon footprint associated with the hybrid IT estate. Customers understand that the hybrid IT estate can be one of their biggest sources of operational emissions and have made measuring and reducing their carbon footprint business imperative. Driving the steady drumbeat of innovation strengthened our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud value proposition for customers to extend our industry leadership, expand our total addressable market and position us well to accelerate the momentum across edge, hybrid cloud and AI in the future. We have been advancing our strategy for the last several years and even a very dynamic market environment, it is clear that our strategy, combined with strong execution and a terrific team set us apart. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the progress we have made to shift our portfolio to higher growth, higher margin areas that they are the most critical to customers as they continue to transform. Our pivot to software and services-rich businesses has led to new customer logos, greater recurring revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow. This is why we are once again raising our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance. Despite a slowdown in some parts of the IT industry, our HPE team has executed our strategy, bringing differentiated innovation and a diverse portfolio to customers around the globe. This positions us to continue to win in the market and deliver for our shareholders. I'm very pleased to pursue these priorities more closely with Jeremy Cox, whom I appointed as our Interim Chief Financial Officer earlier this month. Jeremy is an experienced finance leader whose customer-centric approach, institutional knowledge and track record of operational excellence, sets him up well to serve in this role while we conduct an internal and external search for a permanent CFO. Jeremy will now discuss our quarter financial results in greater detail. So Jeremy, welcome. Over to you.\nJeremy Cox: Thank you very much, Antonio. I'm honored to take on the responsibility of Interim CFO as we go through the process. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of FY 2023. Antonio discussed key highlights on Slide 4. Let me begin with Slide 5, financial highlights. We're actively diversifying our business mix towards our higher-growth, higher-margin portfolio of Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI and HPE GreenLake solutions. This pivot is clearly visible in the 120 basis-point year-over-year expansion of non-GAAP gross margins. We delivered a solid quarter within an IT market still under some pressure. Cycle times remain elongated and digestion of prior orders will continue to have some near-term impact. This has been particularly true in Compute and, to a lesser extent, in Storage. Despite these challenges, we delivered 3.5% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency to $7 billion, which exceeded the midpoint of our Q3 revenue guidance. This figure included a modest amount of AI revenue. We do see several promising indicators that suggest stabilization. Antonio mentioned the sequential improvement in demand across our four product segments. We're starting to see indicators that our largest customers are returning to the market. Intelligent Edge continues to increase revenues rapidly, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis and robust AI demand is evident in our as-a-service orders. Our non-GAAP gross margin rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.9%. This is off just 30 basis points from our high watermark of 36.2% last quarter. Our margin structure reflects the pivot of our business mix to higher margin, software-intensive recurring revenue, such as Intelligent Edge. The edge mix was up 450 basis points year-over-year. Our Q3 '23 non-GAAP operating margin reached 10.3%, this is down 120 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, the driver was largely return of Compute operating margins to just below long-term target range of 11% to 13% after six consecutive quarters above the range. We expect the impact of Compute operating margin cyclicality on HPE's operating margins to decline over time, as our revenue mix shifts towards our higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. Our Intelligent Edge business reached a record-high 29.7% operating margin. We remain focused on productivity and continue to expect revenue growth to outpace OpEx growth over time. Our solid Q3 and margin -- revenue and margin performance led GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.35 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.49, which was up $0.01 year-over-year despite Compute cyclicality. It was also $0.01 above the high end of our Q3 guidance range of $0.44 to $0.48. Our Q3 free cash flow was $955 million. We continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders, paying $154 million in dividends and repurchasing $187 million in stock this quarter. We have now returned $831 million in capital to shareholders this year. Moving to Slide 6. Our as-a-service revenue pivot continues to show strong momentum. ARR reached $1.3 billion in Q3 '23. The benefits of as-a-service deals we won in prior quarters are now appearing in our results, though, the large AI-as-a-service deals booked in Q3 have yet to reach revenues. Year-over-year ARR growth in constant currency has accelerated from 25% in Q4 '22 to 31% -- 38% and now 48% in Q3 '23. The 48% growth is above our long-term 35% to 45% target and should be viewed as an indicator of our long-term momentum rather than as a new growth trajectory. The fastest-growing components within ARR year-over-year are Storage and Edge. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin, recurring software and services revenue. Antonio mentioned that in Q3, our software and services mix rose to 68% and should continue to increase. While this mix has traditionally tilted to services, software is now half of the total. In the future, we expect software growth to exceed services growth and for as-a-service margins to rise over time. To Slide 7. Our Q3 as-a-service order growth was robust. We're pleased to have delivered 122% year-over-year order growth which has raised our cumulative as-a-service TCV to nearly $12 billion. The driving factor was AI demand. A significant percentage of our AI orders have come under the as-a-service model and the strength this quarter should also provide confidence in our long-term 35% to 45% ARR growth outlook. Order growth will fluctuate given the volatility of large as-a-service deals. Now let's turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. And remember, all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In Intelligent Edge, we grew revenues 53% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, delivering record revenues for a fifth consecutive quarter. Customers are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as Edge Connect SD-WAN software and our Aruba Central management platform. We've expanded the Axis Security and SASE funnel to 6 times since the acquisition. Our operating margin of 29.7% was up more than 1,300 basis points year-over-year and 280 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from revenue scale and prior pricing actions, which are helping us build visibility into the durability of our mid-20% margin target over time. While we're making progress on our order book, we expect to carry an above-normal order book into FY '24. In HPC & AI, revenue grew 3% year-over-year. Customer discussions on large language models and generative AI that began in Q1 turned to wins in Q2 and are now showing up as as-a-service orders in Q3. AI, the predominant driver of our 122% year-over-year growth in as-a-service dollars has also driven sequential growth in our corporate total order book, which I'll discuss in a moment. We expect AI deals to provide gross margin rates above historical levels. We believe building and operating large AI models requires unique computational capabilities, including silicon and software that our HPE Cray supercomputers and HPC & AI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable. As for operating margin, our Q3 performance was just below breakeven. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key components and long lead times in this segment mean that operating margins in HPC & AI will continue to fluctuate. We'll discuss our outlook for revenue growth, investment and margin improvement at our Securities Analyst Meeting. Storage fell 2% year-over-year but rose 3% sequentially. HPE Alletra revenue grew triple digits in Q3 for the fifth consecutive quarter. It is now one of our higher revenue products and thus growth rates may normalize. This product is shifting our mix within Storage to higher-margin, software-intensive revenue and is a key driver of our ARR growth. We'll continue to invest in R&D and our owned IP products in this business unit, such as our new file-as-a-service and HPE Alletra MP offerings. Q3 '23 operating margin of 10.7% is down 360 basis points year-over-year as we transition to HPE Alletra. HP Alletra includes a meaningful component of ratable revenue, which pushes revenue recognition out into future periods. Compute revenue was down 10% year-over-year to $2.6 billion and down 5% sequentially. Deal elongation challenges we've discussed previously were most prevalent in the Compute business as some customers digest prior investments. Declining AUPs from a record high in Q1 '23 was also a significant driver. But, as previously noted, we did see sequential demand improvement. And after six quarters of above plan operating margins in Compute, this quarter's 10.9% was a shade below our long-term margin target of 11% to 13%. HPE Financial Services revenues rose 7% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.7 billion grew 6% in constant currency, driven by HPE GreenLake. Our operating margins were down 340 basis points year-over-year, reflecting rapid interest hikes and higher cost of funds that will gradually offset over time through pricing, as well as lower asset management margins as supply challenges ease. Time and time again, HPE FS has proven resilient in a downturn, thanks to the quality underwriting of our book of business. Throughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%, and our Q3 loss ratio of 0.48% was even lower than it was in the full year 2019 pre-pandemic. Slide 9 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. The progress we're making against our edge-to-cloud strategy is evident in the financial results we delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We've held our revenue steady this quarter and expanded non-GAAP diluted net EPS year-over-year despite an uneven spending environment, our transition towards a recurring revenue model and FX rates remaining a significant headwind. FX was a 280 basis point headwind to revenue growth in Q3. On Slide 10, we've included a new depiction of our portfolio shift, which illustrates just how significant the Intelligent Edge business has become for HPE. Even three years ago, Intelligent Edge constituted just 10% of revenue, and this quarter, it represents 20%. Operating profit trajectory is even more dramatic. Edge contributed just over 10% of operating profit three years ago and is now 49% of total segment operating profit. We will offer our forward-looking view at our Security Analyst Meeting. Slide 11 illustrates the progress we've made on our gross margin structure. Our Q3 non-GAAP gross margin is up 120 basis points year-over-year despite FX headwinds. Our year-over-year non-GAAP gross profit and margin growth show the success of our strategic portfolio pivot and the pricing actions HPE has taken. Slide 12 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margin, which was 10.3% in Q3. This is down 20 basis points year-over-year, also inclusive of FX headwinds, and 120 basis points sequentially. While the primary driver of the sequential decline was the return of Compute operating margins to near our target range, we also made certain targeted investments in the quarter to further enable our pivot. Our deliberate portfolio mix shift, pricing strategies and productivity focus put us on track to increase operating margin in FY '23. On Slide 13, as previously announced, we exercised the put option on our shares in H3C and signed a put share purchase agreement that values our 49% H3C stake at US$3.5 billion. The next step in the process is to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and to conclude certain conditions necessary for closing. We expect to conclude this process in the first half of calendar year 2024; although this time line could be further extended pursuant to the terms of our agreement. We intend to update our plans for the use of proceeds once the transaction closes. You can assume that we will use the same disciplined returns-based framework for evaluating investments, capital returns and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating that we've outlined in the past. Finally, we continue to benefit from H3C dividends in FY '23. We'll offer an update on our go-forward expectations for H3C dividend at SAM in October. Now to Slide 14. We generated $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations and $955 million in free cash flow. Our Q3 free cash flow improved by approximately $670 million sequentially and nearly $370 million year-over-year. Similar to our Q4 '22 performance, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of FY '23 and are reiterating our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in free cash flow in FY '23. The timing of receipts and payments plus inventory investments have held cash conversion cycle steady sequentially at 23 days. We expect to exit the year with a neutral cash conversion cycle. Now let's turn to outlook on Slide 15. As we've mentioned, the broader IT market is still pressured. Macro uncertainty is affecting some of our end markets, yet customer investment is rising in others, such as Edge and HPC & AI. We believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive share gains in key markets. We are also entering Q4 with an order book that is more than 2 times pre-pandemic levels. Our order book has increased from more than 1.5 times pre-pandemic levels entering Q3, primarily on the strength of AI orders. The assumptions in our guidance, which incorporate our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, demand, inflationary pressure, supply and FX rates remain relatively unchanged. We've indicated throughout the fiscal year that our financial performance is likely to be weighted to the first half of the year. We continue to view this as the proper framework for FY '23. For Q4, we expect revenues in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.36 and $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.48 and $0.52. We're reiterating our prior fiscal year 2023 guidance of 4% to 6% revenue growth in constant currency. We expect FX to be a 300 basis-point revenue headwind from our previously communicated 250 to 300 basis-point headwind. In parallel, we also reiterate our expectation that margin strength from our portfolio mix shift will deliver non-GAAP operating growth of 6% to 7%. We're reiterating our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of between $1.42 and $1.46 due to tax rate differences and additional amortization of intangibles from our recent acquisitions. We're raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from between $2.06 to $2.14 to between $2.11 and $2.15. We reiterate our guidance for free cash flow of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. For OI&E, we benefited this year from higher interest income and FX hedging costs lower than we originally forecasted. The combination of these and other anticipated benefits in the second half of this fiscal year leads us to expect OI&E to be a positive $50 million to $70 million on a full year basis. We had previously expected OI&E to be neutral for the full year. In terms of capital returns, we are maintaining our dividend and expect to return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. So to conclude, the uneven end market demand thus far in FY '23 is an opportunity for HPE to showcase our differentiated portfolio led by HPE GreenLake Hybrid Cloud, Intelligent Edge and HPC & AI, and we'll continue to take the steps required to further accelerate the pivot of our product portfolio and our company towards faster growth, higher margin recurring revenues. We look forward to updating you with HPE's outlook beyond FY '23 at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October. Now let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could put the AI wins in the same terms you did at the analyst section you had in June when you told us you had $1.6 billion in awards. That was a combination of CapEx and recurring deals that would be spread out over a number of years. So, what I'm looking for is an update on that and how much of the AI are you expecting in that fourth quarter? And sort of what's the timeframe for seeing the benefits? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Thanks, Simon. Well, all those deals we talked through came through. They were booked and the pipeline continues to be super strong. In fact, I will say the pipeline we came in, we exit is pretty much the same. So that means throughout the quarter, we booked those deals and we exit pretty much with the same pipeline we came in. So clearly, the momentum in the business is significant. But as you can see, our progress is showing up in as-a-service, which you saw the 122% as-a-service order growth, which is very significant, and that fuels our order book to be now more than 2 time than pre-pandemic levels, and we exit the HPC & AI quarter with the largest ever order book we ever had. Now we start now shipping some of those orders, those wins, but it's long ways to go. And remember that there's two components related to that. Number one is availability supply, which obviously in the AI space is constrained. Number two is the fact that when you deploy these deals, you have to install it and then drive acceptances, which means elongated times for revenue recognition. And then maybe in a specific win or two, there are other conditions related to the contractual agreements. So the net of this is that what we discussed at the end of Q2 and then during the HPE Discover came all through and then what I'm really pleased of is the quality of the deals we are getting. And I just referenced a half a dozen or so in my opening remarks to give a sense of the type of customers we're winning to make sure you understand the proof points associated with that. And so, as we go forward, we expect this momentum to accelerate, but the revenue recognition will be different than the what I call the demand bookings in our systems because, obviously, that takes time. In any case, the other thing I will say is that one of the reasons why customers are coming to us is because we have a complete life cycle of solutions from training to tuning to inferencing. So, on training side, obviously, these are companies that develop their own language models, whether it's startups or large unique customers. On the tuning side, which I believe will be -- one of the biggest opportunity will be when customers use these foundational models that you can get in the market we're going to offer over time, five unique of them in our AI public cloud instance. So they can tune those models with their data in a private, secure, responsible way. And then number three, which I'm really excited because it would be an accelerator of both Compute and Edge, is going to be the AI inferencing. And so all those three will move concurrently. And so you have to look at this not just the next quarter, but on a mid- to long-term basis, call it, two, four and then eight quarters.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you, Simon. Gary, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. I guess I wanted to build on Simon's question a little bit. I think in the context of last quarter and what you had disclosed at the analyst event, you had also alluded to within that pipeline, large hyperscale cloud opportunities. I'm curious what are you seeing in that vertical? Should we expect that to further expand? Just kind of any context around the positioning within cloud where HPE Enterprise hasn't really historically had a material footprint. Why are you winning in that -- in those opportunities if they're expanding?\nAntonio Neri: Yes, Aaron. So one of the opportunities we won in Q3 was a large hyperscaler. We haven't even started building and shipping that. So that tells you the size of it. And we have further opportunities down as I look at '24. The reason why they come to us is, number one, it's because we have a unique amount of intellectual property. Think about it as an open ecosystem with our networking fabric, which obviously supports NVIDIA. We have a fantastic relationship with NVIDIA, but also supports other type of accelerators. And depending on the AI workload, it can be a mix and match. If you hear my comments, right, in some cases, we have NVIDIA GPUs with potentially AMD CPUs. In some cases, all NVIDIA, in some cases -- in the case, for example, of the Aurora system, the Argonne Laboratory is actually all Intel. So that provides flexibility for customers whether it's performance driven or supply driven over time. And the other one is because we have unique expertise in AI. Remember, we have been in AI for a decade. It's just we have done it for unique discrete customers. That we're building this system on a purpose base. But now this is why we entered the AI public cloud to democratize the AI for every enterprise -- and that's why we saw the growth in the HPE GreenLake as-a-service AI bookings, because they cannot build that themselves. And the other piece of this is the ability to consume this in a sustainable way. I think sustainability is becoming a key component because customers deploy AI want to make sure they control the carbon footprint with it. And then the data center services, which are essential to run this massive at-scale AI solutions. And then for the large language model companies, one of the things that attract them to us it's not just all of the things I just said, it is the fact that working with us, they can get access to our route to market, so they can reach enterprises in ways potentially they couldn't by themselves. So it's a combination of multiple things. That they are all coming our way, I will say. But ultimately, our strategy is a software-led strategy using our supercomputer as a cloud kind of experience and then wrapping around all the services and the software needed to provide that level of capability.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you, Aaron. Gary, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe taking a second on the Intelligent Edge business. Can you just kind of give a sense of what is the biggest forward driver that you're seeing? I think people understand kind of the catch-up spend and the backlog release that has been done, but just what you're kind of seeing in ongoing kind of orders today? And is that Wi-Fi 6? Is it still kind of return to work? Just what are the biggest drivers that you're seeing to kind of help continue the growth of that business? Thanks.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thank you for the question. I'm incredibly proud of the work we have done in the Intelligent Edge business segment. This is the opportunity I highlighted in 2018, where I said we will invest over the next four years to build the right solutions that ultimately will allow customers to drive what I call a data-first digital transformation. So, it's a combination of things: number one, return to work, obviously, you need to have the right connectivity; number two, in order to process the data, you need to connect devices and things that are essential, right, in order to provide the right cloud experience on those types of workloads and applications. But our portfolio is unique because we provide edge to cloud networking capabilities. Our strength obviously has been always in the campus and branch. We see that to transition to Wi-Fi 6. In fact, we shipped more than $30 million ports so far with Wi-Fi 6. By number of access points and ports, we are one of the largest, if not the largest, I will say. And also now that drives the 26 million ports we drove in the switching side, which was the thesis when I acquired Aruba in 2015. Over time, we have made these all cloud native and we have added to it. And so, as we look forward, what I'm excited is that we are delivering more capabilities and expanding our time with the same experience. So, we added Software-Defined Wide Area Network. Three, four years ago was a niche market, now is a very large market more than $5 billion in the TAM, and that's why we did the acquisition of Silver Peak. Now that's integrating the same control plane with HPE GreenLake as a part of the Aruba experience. And now we just completed the acquisition of Axis Security. So it takes Axis Security and Silver Peak. Now we're going to offer the most comprehensive SSE framework at the edge. And then also we are integrating Athonet, which provide both core 5G software-defined solutions and private 5G at the edge. All of this comes under a cloud native model in a subscription based model, which will continue to fuel the growth as we think about '24 and '25. Bottom line, it is one of the most comprehensive portfolio out in the market and no surprise obviously with the growth we have, obviously, we are converting more of our order book. But we exited Q3 and we expect to exit Q4 with a significant elevated order book in -- as we enter '24. And you can see the results right now represent 20% of the company revenue and almost half of the company profit. And so, the mix shift had really worked for us in this particular part of the portfolio as it is now with GreenLake as well.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you, Meta. Gary?\nOperator: The next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. If you can -- storage was up sequentially, which was a positive and it seems like the HPE Alletra is getting traction. As you think about the fourth quarter -- the fiscal fourth quarter, if you can provide some guidelines on how you're thinking about your storage portfolio, both on the top-line as well as when you think margins kind of get back to, I think, the target margins, which are much higher than where they are right now? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: So, let me start and I will pass it to Jeremy. The team and I drove an intentional strategy to pivot that portfolio, which was a conglomerate of different offerings that we built over 15 years or so to one consistent architecture that allows customers to consume data services, both primary and secondary in a cloud-native way and a subscription-based model. So, HPE Alletra is our primary storage that now covers pretty much all the price segments of the price bands, if you will, of the traditional storage from general purpose to business critical to mission-critical. And we address block and file. And in the future, we're also going to address the object piece. So as a customer, you can now subscribe to HPE GreenLake, deploy one consistent back-end infrastructure, whether it's in a colo, or the edge, or in your own data center and consume hybrid cloud data services. And you can put block type of solutions or file and then eventually object, which is a significant CapEx reduction for customers because they don't have to buy three different ways to deploy it. And an OpEx reduction because obviously, it's very efficient to manage in a cloud type of experience. And so, this business went from zero to in excess of $1 billion very, very quickly. And it's amazing that it's one of the fastest-growing products in our portfolio, growing triple digits. But what I'm really pleased is that it comes with a significant subscription, which is growing double digits. So maybe, Jeremy, you want to take the second part of the question, how we see this evolve, in particular from a margin perspective.\nJeremy Cox: Sure. And that's where I'll pick up, Antonio, it was on Alletra. I think we've previously talked to you guys about how this product is really a combination now of a higher software component and that software component does have an element of taking what was prior product revenue and now deferring that onto the balance sheet, about 14% is deferred onto the balance sheet. And so, as we see that work off over time as that product is deployed out, we'll start seeing an inflection point, and that should positively impact revenue as we look forward, particularly into FY '24. And that also has an impact on the margin line, too, as that deferral is deferring software-based revenue that has a higher margin concentration to it. So we would expect to see our operating margins start to recover back to kind of historical levels as well as we look forward to '24.\nAntonio Neri: And as Jeremy said, right, so there is a specific component is ratable here. So, we are going through that transition. But for two consecutive quarters, we saw demand improving, Q1 to Q2 and Q2 to Q3, and that's very positive. And we expect that to show up as we go forward as we transition those orders into revenues.\nJeff Kvaal: Asiya, thank you. Gary?\nOperator: The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess you mentioned a couple of times in your prepared remarks about the cyclicality in the Compute business, which is a headwind. Maybe if you can outline your thoughts on where we are in the cycle? Is there more downside to revenue and margins as we move into fiscal fourth quarter? Or -- you did reference a demand improvement. So I'm just sort of curious, does it imply fiscal 3Q is sort of the near-term trough here in the business. And more broadly, if I can ask like questions that investors are asking us today is how much of the demand improvement that you're seeing going into fiscal '24 helps you offset the tailwind that you have this year from backlog and still enable you to grow in fiscal '24? If you can share any early thoughts on that? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. So first of all, I think it's important to recognize that the traditional general-purpose Compute business goes through these cycles, right? Last year, we obviously have got a significant demand uptick because of the supply chain challenges. Customers are absorbing that, in some cases, we still need to deploy some of those products and the like. But we saw signs of stabilization and we saw demand improvement at the unit level, which is super, super important because demand in the unit level also drives attach. And as I referenced in my remarks, that unit demand together with the storage demand and obviously, the acceleration we saw in HPE GreenLake drove double-digit growth in operational services, which obviously is important as we think about ratable revenue and profit as we look into the future. Now we have this unique expectation of the company because in the past, we wanted to give you visibility of what is general-purpose compute and what is HPC and supercomputers. But when you combine the two is what I refer to the server category. Because in the end, there is a server component associated with that. And there is different IP you bundle depending it's a general purpose or a supercomputer. And the combination of general-purpose compute, as you refer, and HPC and supercomputers demand clearly improved very nicely quarter-over-quarter. I think as I think about 2024 as a server category, I think you're going to see the continued improvement in demand on HPC & AI. I think the AI inference related to Compute will be announced to the rate for Compute. And then we have to see the evolution of price in the commodity space, which you will expect some time in '24. That curve will end up again because as demand stabilize and improves, cost of commodity will start going up. And remember, we also have a tradition in the making from what I call Gen 10 and Gen 10.5 to Gen 11. And Gen 11 also comes with a higher, we call it, product intensity. So as more options and the options come with larger memory and larger type of storage and obviously more GPU embedded in the traditional compute will drive, over time, AUPs up. I don't know if Jeremy, do you have anything to add.\nJeremy Cox: Maybe I'll pick up on the margin side of it, Antonio. Obviously, in these cycle times, we've -- I think we've proven that in down cycles where commodities are declining, causing declines in AUP. We've been able to hold pricing to drive margin. And then as it inflects back and turns back up, we've been able to be leading market leaders on pricing to make sure that we're catching it appropriately on that. So our expectation is as that changes throughout this process, on top of the point that Antonio made about Gen 11 really driving an AUP premium for us, which can also be an impact. We still expect that 11% to 13% operating profit, structural range to be reflective of what our longer-term expectations are.\nAntonio Neri: But let me reinforce one important point because if you go back two years or three years, whatever was the cyclicality at the time, we will have a different dynamic in our total company revenue and profit. I want to reemphasize that because of our mix shift to edge, hybrid cloud and now AI as we go forward, which always expect margins to improve. The strong performance we had in that mix shift more than offsets the cyclicality we saw in Compute, which is very evident in our Q3 results because our margins improved again, 120 basis points. If you go back two years ago, our margins at the company level were in the 33%-s, in 2022, we're in the 34%-s, and in 2023, we are in the high 35%-s. And so that tells you that structurally, our business composition is shifting, and we intend to continue to drive that mix shift. And that's why software and services with Intelligent Edge and hybrid cloud and now AI with our software-led strategy, we'll continue to sustain that. And we will be able to manage the cyclical Compute much, much better.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you, Samik. Gary, could we make this our last question, please?\nOperator: And our final question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Antonio, you're exiting this year with a high single-digit decline in revenues and Edge clearly is doing extremely well and some benefit from backlog. How confident are you that HPE can grow revenues in fiscal '24, given the current exit trajectory of the business? You also noted some stabilization. So curious to get just some high-level thoughts, not explicit guidance, maybe, but just some directional commentary on how you could see that playing out.\nAntonio Neri: I think your comment is related to Q4, right? So obviously, we are going to lap a very high quarter because last year in Q4, we were able to convert more of that order book related to the fact that supply started improving in Q4, and you saw that in Q1. So to me, it's just a lapping of the numbers. But that said, we're going to talk to this at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expect revenue to continue to improve in fiscal year '24. We're going to tell you exactly what that will look like. But I will say that while revenue will improve year-over-year, and remember, in Q1, we're also going to have a big lap because Q1 revenue was $7.8 billion, the fact of the matter on a yearly basis, right, this year, we are growing 4% to 6%. And Jeremy talked about the headwind we saw in the FX, which is now 300 basis points. So, we are growing faster than what we guided you at the beginning of the year, which was 2% to 4%. We are now growing 4% to 6%. And we expect our revenue to continue to improve because of these momentum we have in the businesses, but we'll guide you a specific percentage at the Security Analyst Meeting. But the other important part is that the mix of our revenue is changing, and the gross margin mix is changing, and also the way we generate free cash flow is changing. And so, more to come when we talk at the Security Analyst Meeting, okay? I know that, unfortunately, you have to cover a lot of companies today, and I understand HP Inc. is about to start the call. I hope you can see from this quarter results how our strategy is working. We are delivering on our commitments. We always do what we say. And we are shifting successfully our portfolio. And so, despite some aspects of the market, being a little bit more challenged than others, we continue to grow revenue, we continue to expand margins, and we'll continue to improve our net earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis. So, I'm looking forward to see you at the Security Analyst Meeting in October. We're going to have it in New York, so it's a little bit more accessible. So, I hope to see you soon. And if you have any questions, we'll follow up with you offline. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon. Thank you, everyone, for joining today. HPE delivered another solid quarter. We again increased our revenue, gross margin and earnings per share year-over-year and delivered strong free cash flow. Our results are being driven by our intentional ongoing mix shift to higher growth, higher margin parts of our portfolio that are critical priorities to customers. Our success in shifting the portfolio delivered a 120 basis points year-over-year non-GAAP gross margin expansion, driven by exceptional performance in areas like the Intelligent Edge, where revenue has set its fifth consecutive record quarter, and HPE GreenLake, which continue to accelerate our strategic pivot, generating higher recurring revenue and gross profit across our four product segments, driven by the increased mix of high margin software and services. In Q3, our Intelligent Edge business contributed 20% of our total company revenue. It is now the largest source of HPE's operating profit at 49% of our total segment operating profit. Our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform is accelerating our other service pivots, delivering an annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, of $1.3 billion, a 48% increase year-over-year. Our strategic shift towards edge, hybrid cloud and AI delivered through our HPE GreenLake cloud platform is working, and we are delivering on our financial commitments. Because of our momentum and strong execution throughout this fiscal year, and once again, we are raising our full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance. GAAP for full year diluted net earnings per share guidance will remain unchanged. For non-GAAP, diluted net earnings per share we are increasing to $2.30 at the midpoint, while maintaining both our full year constant currency revenue growth guidance of 4% to 6% and full year free cash flow guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. We will provide more details later in our call today, including on a GAAP basis. Our view of the macro environment remains unchanged from recent months. Customers continue to prioritize their data-first digital transformation, despite some reservations about the macroeconomic environment for the future. While the broader IT market is still pressured, demand for our products and services grew sequentially in the third quarter across all key segments of our business, driven by high-growth areas like AI and HPE GreenLake. We continue to see strong interest in our AI and supercomputing offerings from enterprise customers who are incorporating artificial intelligence into their businesses. This is translating into significantly higher demand for our HPC & AI business segment as customers discover HPE's unique capabilities to power unprecedented level of performance for AI at scale, including using our market-leading supercomputers built with sustainability in mind to train and tune their AI models. Total HPE revenue during the third quarter increased 3.5% year-over-year to $7 billion, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.9%, very close to the record level we achieved in the second quarter. Higher profitability in the third quarter compared to last year also corresponded to an increase in non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, which was $0.49, up 2% year-over-year. And we generated $955 million in free cash flow, an increase of nearly $370 million. The HPE GreenLake cloud platform is a key driver of financial performance, with our hybrid cloud offerings through the platform continue to attract new customers and compel existing customers to expand their contracts. HPE GreenLake orders rose 122% year-over-year, resulting in a nearly $1.5 billion increase in our as-a-service total contract value since last quarter. Our cumulative booked total contract value now stands at just under $12 billion. The scale and the strength of HPE GreenLake is evident; it supports 27,000 unique customer logos and 3.4 million connected devices, and more than 1,100 partners sell HPE GreenLake, one of the largest partner ecosystems selling as-a-service offerings in the industry. As we grow our ARR, we are also increasing the share of high-margin software and services. Software and services increased 2 percentage points sequentially to 68% of the total ARR mix, compared to 66% in the second quarter, with ongoing contributions from SaaS offerings tied to our HPE Ezmeral Software, storage and HPE Aruba Networking, our operational Services and OpsRamp, our recent acquisition. We are well-positioned to continue to grow the software and services mix within our ARR. For example, we saw a double-digit increase in demand with HPE operational services this quarter, which will contribute to future recurring revenues. The impressive gross margin in our as-a-service recurring revenues helped lift our already-strong overall company gross margin this quarter. These results demonstrate the relevance of our differentiated HPE GreenLake value proposition of providing one unified hybrid cloud experience to empower customers to access, analyze and extract value from their data, no matter where it lies, at the edge, in the colos or data center and in the public cloud. Now I would like to highlight a few important takeaways in our business segment results. First, as I said earlier, HPE's performance in the Intelligent Edge segment was particularly noteworthy in the quarter. Intelligent Edge revenue increased 53% year-over-year and operating profit more than doubled in another exceptional quarter for this business segment. I'm particularly pleased that our Intelligent Edge SaaS revenues continued to climb double-digits. We are gaining share, benefiting from improved availability of supply, high shipment volume and a strong response to our SaaS edge offerings in terms of both demand and revenue. Momentum in Intelligent Edge was consistent around the globe, with revenue increasing by double-digits in all regions in the third quarter. One example is the University of Maryland, which wanted a stronger cloud-based policy-driven wired and wireless network that could provide improved automation, better device visibility and easier and more secure access for students, faculty and staff as they are returning to campus. The University selected HPE Aruba Networking for a campus-wide refresh to enhance the flexibility, visibility and security of its network through HPE Aruba ClearPass, our SaaS platform to onboard new devices, grant varying access levels and keep network secure. The HPC & AI business segment saw a way for demand acceleration in the quarter, as we converted on AI deal opportunities and shipped orders that leverage our unique end-to-end AI value proposition, from training to tuning to inference. As a result, we exited the quarter with the largest HPC & AI order book we have ever had. Our AI momentum also helped grow our total HPE order book, which is now at more than 2 times pre-pandemic levels, driven by exceptional customer demand for our AI solutions and sequential demand improvements across our four product segments. Only HPE can combine our unique AI software and slingshot networking fabric. HPE services offerings and market-leading sustainable supercomputers. Our open ecosystem of AI suppliers is also an advantage for customers, who are turning to us for a full-spectrum of enterprise AI workloads and use cases, spanning large-scale model development, training, tune and inferencing. Through the UK's GW4 Alliance of four UK research universities, HPE won a contract from the UK Research and Innovation to develop Isambard 3, a supercomputer that leverages the latest HPE Cray XD supercomputers, HPE Slingshot Interconnect and NVIDIA Grace CPU -- GPU Superchip. The system will provide researchers engineers and data scientists purpose-built capabilities to train AI models and accelerate research in clean energy, drug discovery, medical diagnosis and astrophysics. In addition, we were selected by Tokyo Institute of Technology Global Scientific Information and Computing Center to build its next-generation supercomputer, which is called TSUBAME 4.0, which includes AMD CPUs and NVIDIA's GPUs to accelerate AI-driven scientific discovery in medicine, material science and climate research. Recursion Pharmaceuticals is a leading public tech-bio company that uses advancement in AI to accelerate and industrialize the discovery of new drugs. Recursion turned to HPE's AI software to scale its foundation model efforts, significantly speed up training across its more than 25 petabytes of biological and chemical data and improve team collaboration. We are seeing AI projects generate exciting results on our supercomputers. For example, the LUMI supercomputer built by HPE with AMD CPUs and GPUs is the fastest system in Europe and the third fastest in the world. It has enabled generative AI projects, such as creating the world's largest finished language model, and it has helped researchers apply AI for early detection of diagnosis of breast and prostate cancers. We continue to make progress in ushering in the area of exascale supercomputing, which enables unprecedented scale and performance for larger AI models, such as generative AI. This quarter, HPE in collaboration with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory started to build and test El Capitan, one of the largest upcoming exascale supercomputers. El Capitan, which uses AMD CPUs and GPUs is expected to reach two exaFLOPS of peak performance, will allow researchers to apply AI to advance U.S. national security and breakthroughs in medical and drug research initiatives. We are seeing demand improving in both our Storage and Compute segments. Storage demand was solid year-over-year with a cloud-native HPE Alletra portfolio recording triple-digit revenue growth. Storage SaaS revenue also increased double digits as we continue to intentionally drive more of HPE's Alletra own IP through HPE GreenLake. Compute performed well considering the sector ongoing cyclicality. We saw sequential unit demand increase in the quarter. One area where we anticipate demand picking up in the coming quarters is customers seeking a solution to run AI inference workloads. Our new HPE ProLiant Gen 11 servers optimized for AI workloads are well positioned for this growing customer need. During the third quarter, we started shipping these servers, which boosted AI inference performance by more than 5x over previous models. And just last week, we expanded our portfolio for enterprise tuning and inference solutions with NVIDIA and VMware to accelerate their customers' generative AI deployments. To round out our major segments, in HPE Financial Services, revenue climbed 7% year-over-year and financing volume ticked up 6%. HPE Financial Services continues to be strategically important as we continue to ramp up our as-a-service volumes through HPE GreenLake. We continue to strengthen our innovation from edge to cloud, position HPE well for the future. In June, we hosted more than 10,000 customers and partners at our annual HPE Discovery event, where we unveiled exciting new edge, hybrid cloud and AI solutions to help customers achieve their business goals and gain competitive advantage. At HPE Discover, we announced we have entered the AI public cloud market with HPE GreenLake for large language models. Available at the end of this calendar year, the offering will enable a wide variety of enterprise customers to privately train and tune their data, using our industry-leading AI sustainable supercomputer infrastructure and software. We also extended our hybrid cloud leadership at HPE Discover with new HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud services, including our new SaaS-based IT Operations Management solution from our recent acquisition of OpsRamp. And to drive faster, easier and more sustainable ways to deploy our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud solutions outside of the data center, we expanded our partnership with colo market leader Equinix, which enable customers to go from [quarter] (ph) production in days by using our HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise stack. Two new HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise customers are global logistics solutions leader, Swisslog, and global media -- global company [Media House] (ph). Swisslog chose HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise to help accelerate their automation of its warehouse centers with a cutting-edge on-premises private cloud that could provide rapid, secure and controlled service delivery. Media House, which owns more than 30 different news brands in Europe, wanted a modern on-premise private cloud to accelerate its digital transformation and better leverage data to attract and retain subscribers with a more personalized customer experience. HPE GreenLake will help the company achieve operational agility, mitigate risk and address IT skills gap and advance its digital priorities. At HPE Discover, we expanded our HPE GreenLake private cloud portfolio with HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business Edition, a new offering that allows customers to spin a virtual machine across hybrid clouds on demand. This new offer is an extension of a hyperconverged portfolio with automation and hybrid cloud software built into the private cloud solution. Early in the quarter, we previewed a new sustainability dashboard on the HPE GreenLake platform alongside a comprehensive portfolio of sustainability services designed to help organizations reduce the carbon footprint associated with the hybrid IT estate. Customers understand that the hybrid IT estate can be one of their biggest sources of operational emissions and have made measuring and reducing their carbon footprint business imperative. Driving the steady drumbeat of innovation strengthened our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud value proposition for customers to extend our industry leadership, expand our total addressable market and position us well to accelerate the momentum across edge, hybrid cloud and AI in the future. We have been advancing our strategy for the last several years and even a very dynamic market environment, it is clear that our strategy, combined with strong execution and a terrific team set us apart. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the progress we have made to shift our portfolio to higher growth, higher margin areas that they are the most critical to customers as they continue to transform. Our pivot to software and services-rich businesses has led to new customer logos, greater recurring revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow. This is why we are once again raising our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance. Despite a slowdown in some parts of the IT industry, our HPE team has executed our strategy, bringing differentiated innovation and a diverse portfolio to customers around the globe. This positions us to continue to win in the market and deliver for our shareholders. I'm very pleased to pursue these priorities more closely with Jeremy Cox, whom I appointed as our Interim Chief Financial Officer earlier this month. Jeremy is an experienced finance leader whose customer-centric approach, institutional knowledge and track record of operational excellence, sets him up well to serve in this role while we conduct an internal and external search for a permanent CFO. Jeremy will now discuss our quarter financial results in greater detail. So Jeremy, welcome. Over to you. Thanks, Simon. Well, all those deals we talked through came through. They were booked and the pipeline continues to be super strong. In fact, I will say the pipeline we came in, we exit is pretty much the same. So that means throughout the quarter, we booked those deals and we exit pretty much with the same pipeline we came in. So clearly, the momentum in the business is significant. But as you can see, our progress is showing up in as-a-service, which you saw the 122% as-a-service order growth, which is very significant, and that fuels our order book to be now more than 2 time than pre-pandemic levels, and we exit the HPC & AI quarter with the largest ever order book we ever had. Now we start now shipping some of those orders, those wins, but it's long ways to go. And remember that there's two components related to that. Number one is availability supply, which obviously in the AI space is constrained. Number two is the fact that when you deploy these deals, you have to install it and then drive acceptances, which means elongated times for revenue recognition. And then maybe in a specific win or two, there are other conditions related to the contractual agreements. So the net of this is that what we discussed at the end of Q2 and then during the HPE Discover came all through and then what I'm really pleased of is the quality of the deals we are getting. And I just referenced a half a dozen or so in my opening remarks to give a sense of the type of customers we're winning to make sure you understand the proof points associated with that. And so, as we go forward, we expect this momentum to accelerate, but the revenue recognition will be different than the what I call the demand bookings in our systems because, obviously, that takes time. In any case, the other thing I will say is that one of the reasons why customers are coming to us is because we have a complete life cycle of solutions from training to tuning to inferencing. So, on training side, obviously, these are companies that develop their own language models, whether it's startups or large unique customers. On the tuning side, which I believe will be -- one of the biggest opportunity will be when customers use these foundational models that you can get in the market we're going to offer over time, five unique of them in our AI public cloud instance. So they can tune those models with their data in a private, secure, responsible way. And then number three, which I'm really excited because it would be an accelerator of both Compute and Edge, is going to be the AI inferencing. And so all those three will move concurrently. And so you have to look at this not just the next quarter, but on a mid- to long-term basis, call it, two, four and then eight quarters. Yes, Aaron. So one of the opportunities we won in Q3 was a large hyperscaler. We haven't even started building and shipping that. So that tells you the size of it. And we have further opportunities down as I look at '24. The reason why they come to us is, number one, it's because we have a unique amount of intellectual property. Think about it as an open ecosystem with our networking fabric, which obviously supports NVIDIA. We have a fantastic relationship with NVIDIA, but also supports other type of accelerators. And depending on the AI workload, it can be a mix and match. If you hear my comments, right, in some cases, we have NVIDIA GPUs with potentially AMD CPUs. In some cases, all NVIDIA, in some cases -- in the case, for example, of the Aurora system, the Argonne Laboratory is actually all Intel. So that provides flexibility for customers whether it's performance driven or supply driven over time. And the other one is because we have unique expertise in AI. Remember, we have been in AI for a decade. It's just we have done it for unique discrete customers. That we're building this system on a purpose base. But now this is why we entered the AI public cloud to democratize the AI for every enterprise -- and that's why we saw the growth in the HPE GreenLake as-a-service AI bookings, because they cannot build that themselves. And the other piece of this is the ability to consume this in a sustainable way. I think sustainability is becoming a key component because customers deploy AI want to make sure they control the carbon footprint with it. And then the data center services, which are essential to run this massive at-scale AI solutions. And then for the large language model companies, one of the things that attract them to us it's not just all of the things I just said, it is the fact that working with us, they can get access to our route to market, so they can reach enterprises in ways potentially they couldn't by themselves. So it's a combination of multiple things. That they are all coming our way, I will say. But ultimately, our strategy is a software-led strategy using our supercomputer as a cloud kind of experience and then wrapping around all the services and the software needed to provide that level of capability. Well, thank you for the question. I'm incredibly proud of the work we have done in the Intelligent Edge business segment. This is the opportunity I highlighted in 2018, where I said we will invest over the next four years to build the right solutions that ultimately will allow customers to drive what I call a data-first digital transformation. So, it's a combination of things: number one, return to work, obviously, you need to have the right connectivity; number two, in order to process the data, you need to connect devices and things that are essential, right, in order to provide the right cloud experience on those types of workloads and applications. But our portfolio is unique because we provide edge to cloud networking capabilities. Our strength obviously has been always in the campus and branch. We see that to transition to Wi-Fi 6. In fact, we shipped more than $30 million ports so far with Wi-Fi 6. By number of access points and ports, we are one of the largest, if not the largest, I will say. And also now that drives the 26 million ports we drove in the switching side, which was the thesis when I acquired Aruba in 2015. Over time, we have made these all cloud native and we have added to it. And so, as we look forward, what I'm excited is that we are delivering more capabilities and expanding our time with the same experience. So, we added Software-Defined Wide Area Network. Three, four years ago was a niche market, now is a very large market more than $5 billion in the TAM, and that's why we did the acquisition of Silver Peak. Now that's integrating the same control plane with HPE GreenLake as a part of the Aruba experience. And now we just completed the acquisition of Axis Security. So it takes Axis Security and Silver Peak. Now we're going to offer the most comprehensive SSE framework at the edge. And then also we are integrating Athonet, which provide both core 5G software-defined solutions and private 5G at the edge. All of this comes under a cloud native model in a subscription based model, which will continue to fuel the growth as we think about '24 and '25. Bottom line, it is one of the most comprehensive portfolio out in the market and no surprise obviously with the growth we have, obviously, we are converting more of our order book. But we exited Q3 and we expect to exit Q4 with a significant elevated order book in -- as we enter '24. And you can see the results right now represent 20% of the company revenue and almost half of the company profit. And so, the mix shift had really worked for us in this particular part of the portfolio as it is now with GreenLake as well. So, let me start and I will pass it to Jeremy. The team and I drove an intentional strategy to pivot that portfolio, which was a conglomerate of different offerings that we built over 15 years or so to one consistent architecture that allows customers to consume data services, both primary and secondary in a cloud-native way and a subscription-based model. So, HPE Alletra is our primary storage that now covers pretty much all the price segments of the price bands, if you will, of the traditional storage from general purpose to business critical to mission-critical. And we address block and file. And in the future, we're also going to address the object piece. So as a customer, you can now subscribe to HPE GreenLake, deploy one consistent back-end infrastructure, whether it's in a colo, or the edge, or in your own data center and consume hybrid cloud data services. And you can put block type of solutions or file and then eventually object, which is a significant CapEx reduction for customers because they don't have to buy three different ways to deploy it. And an OpEx reduction because obviously, it's very efficient to manage in a cloud type of experience. And so, this business went from zero to in excess of $1 billion very, very quickly. And it's amazing that it's one of the fastest-growing products in our portfolio, growing triple digits. But what I'm really pleased is that it comes with a significant subscription, which is growing double digits. So maybe, Jeremy, you want to take the second part of the question, how we see this evolve, in particular from a margin perspective. And as Jeremy said, right, so there is a specific component is ratable here. So, we are going through that transition. But for two consecutive quarters, we saw demand improving, Q1 to Q2 and Q2 to Q3, and that's very positive. And we expect that to show up as we go forward as we transition those orders into revenues. Sure. So first of all, I think it's important to recognize that the traditional general-purpose Compute business goes through these cycles, right? Last year, we obviously have got a significant demand uptick because of the supply chain challenges. Customers are absorbing that, in some cases, we still need to deploy some of those products and the like. But we saw signs of stabilization and we saw demand improvement at the unit level, which is super, super important because demand in the unit level also drives attach. And as I referenced in my remarks, that unit demand together with the storage demand and obviously, the acceleration we saw in HPE GreenLake drove double-digit growth in operational services, which obviously is important as we think about ratable revenue and profit as we look into the future. Now we have this unique expectation of the company because in the past, we wanted to give you visibility of what is general-purpose compute and what is HPC and supercomputers. But when you combine the two is what I refer to the server category. Because in the end, there is a server component associated with that. And there is different IP you bundle depending it's a general purpose or a supercomputer. And the combination of general-purpose compute, as you refer, and HPC and supercomputers demand clearly improved very nicely quarter-over-quarter. I think as I think about 2024 as a server category, I think you're going to see the continued improvement in demand on HPC & AI. I think the AI inference related to Compute will be announced to the rate for Compute. And then we have to see the evolution of price in the commodity space, which you will expect some time in '24. That curve will end up again because as demand stabilize and improves, cost of commodity will start going up. And remember, we also have a tradition in the making from what I call Gen 10 and Gen 10.5 to Gen 11. And Gen 11 also comes with a higher, we call it, product intensity. So as more options and the options come with larger memory and larger type of storage and obviously more GPU embedded in the traditional compute will drive, over time, AUPs up. I don't know if Jeremy, do you have anything to add. But let me reinforce one important point because if you go back two years or three years, whatever was the cyclicality at the time, we will have a different dynamic in our total company revenue and profit. I want to reemphasize that because of our mix shift to edge, hybrid cloud and now AI as we go forward, which always expect margins to improve. The strong performance we had in that mix shift more than offsets the cyclicality we saw in Compute, which is very evident in our Q3 results because our margins improved again, 120 basis points. If you go back two years ago, our margins at the company level were in the 33%-s, in 2022, we're in the 34%-s, and in 2023, we are in the high 35%-s. And so that tells you that structurally, our business composition is shifting, and we intend to continue to drive that mix shift. And that's why software and services with Intelligent Edge and hybrid cloud and now AI with our software-led strategy, we'll continue to sustain that. And we will be able to manage the cyclical Compute much, much better. I think your comment is related to Q4, right? So obviously, we are going to lap a very high quarter because last year in Q4, we were able to convert more of that order book related to the fact that supply started improving in Q4, and you saw that in Q1. So to me, it's just a lapping of the numbers. But that said, we're going to talk to this at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expect revenue to continue to improve in fiscal year '24. We're going to tell you exactly what that will look like. But I will say that while revenue will improve year-over-year, and remember, in Q1, we're also going to have a big lap because Q1 revenue was $7.8 billion, the fact of the matter on a yearly basis, right, this year, we are growing 4% to 6%. And Jeremy talked about the headwind we saw in the FX, which is now 300 basis points. So, we are growing faster than what we guided you at the beginning of the year, which was 2% to 4%. We are now growing 4% to 6%. And we expect our revenue to continue to improve because of these momentum we have in the businesses, but we'll guide you a specific percentage at the Security Analyst Meeting. But the other important part is that the mix of our revenue is changing, and the gross margin mix is changing, and also the way we generate free cash flow is changing. And so, more to come when we talk at the Security Analyst Meeting, okay? I know that, unfortunately, you have to cover a lot of companies today, and I understand HP Inc. is about to start the call. I hope you can see from this quarter results how our strategy is working. We are delivering on our commitments. We always do what we say. And we are shifting successfully our portfolio. And so, despite some aspects of the market, being a little bit more challenged than others, we continue to grow revenue, we continue to expand margins, and we'll continue to improve our net earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis. So, I'm looking forward to see you at the Security Analyst Meeting in October. We're going to have it in New York, so it's a little bit more accessible. So, I hope to see you soon. And if you have any questions, we'll follow up with you offline. Thank you for your time today."

            "name": "Jeremy Cox",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. I'm honored to take on the responsibility of Interim CFO as we go through the process. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of FY 2023. Antonio discussed key highlights on Slide 4. Let me begin with Slide 5, financial highlights. We're actively diversifying our business mix towards our higher-growth, higher-margin portfolio of Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI and HPE GreenLake solutions. This pivot is clearly visible in the 120 basis-point year-over-year expansion of non-GAAP gross margins. We delivered a solid quarter within an IT market still under some pressure. Cycle times remain elongated and digestion of prior orders will continue to have some near-term impact. This has been particularly true in Compute and, to a lesser extent, in Storage. Despite these challenges, we delivered 3.5% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency to $7 billion, which exceeded the midpoint of our Q3 revenue guidance. This figure included a modest amount of AI revenue. We do see several promising indicators that suggest stabilization. Antonio mentioned the sequential improvement in demand across our four product segments. We're starting to see indicators that our largest customers are returning to the market. Intelligent Edge continues to increase revenues rapidly, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis and robust AI demand is evident in our as-a-service orders. Our non-GAAP gross margin rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.9%. This is off just 30 basis points from our high watermark of 36.2% last quarter. Our margin structure reflects the pivot of our business mix to higher margin, software-intensive recurring revenue, such as Intelligent Edge. The edge mix was up 450 basis points year-over-year. Our Q3 '23 non-GAAP operating margin reached 10.3%, this is down 120 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, the driver was largely return of Compute operating margins to just below long-term target range of 11% to 13% after six consecutive quarters above the range. We expect the impact of Compute operating margin cyclicality on HPE's operating margins to decline over time, as our revenue mix shifts towards our higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. Our Intelligent Edge business reached a record-high 29.7% operating margin. We remain focused on productivity and continue to expect revenue growth to outpace OpEx growth over time. Our solid Q3 and margin -- revenue and margin performance led GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.35 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.49, which was up $0.01 year-over-year despite Compute cyclicality. It was also $0.01 above the high end of our Q3 guidance range of $0.44 to $0.48. Our Q3 free cash flow was $955 million. We continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders, paying $154 million in dividends and repurchasing $187 million in stock this quarter. We have now returned $831 million in capital to shareholders this year. Moving to Slide 6. Our as-a-service revenue pivot continues to show strong momentum. ARR reached $1.3 billion in Q3 '23. The benefits of as-a-service deals we won in prior quarters are now appearing in our results, though, the large AI-as-a-service deals booked in Q3 have yet to reach revenues. Year-over-year ARR growth in constant currency has accelerated from 25% in Q4 '22 to 31% -- 38% and now 48% in Q3 '23. The 48% growth is above our long-term 35% to 45% target and should be viewed as an indicator of our long-term momentum rather than as a new growth trajectory. The fastest-growing components within ARR year-over-year are Storage and Edge. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin, recurring software and services revenue. Antonio mentioned that in Q3, our software and services mix rose to 68% and should continue to increase. While this mix has traditionally tilted to services, software is now half of the total. In the future, we expect software growth to exceed services growth and for as-a-service margins to rise over time. To Slide 7. Our Q3 as-a-service order growth was robust. We're pleased to have delivered 122% year-over-year order growth which has raised our cumulative as-a-service TCV to nearly $12 billion. The driving factor was AI demand. A significant percentage of our AI orders have come under the as-a-service model and the strength this quarter should also provide confidence in our long-term 35% to 45% ARR growth outlook. Order growth will fluctuate given the volatility of large as-a-service deals. Now let's turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. And remember, all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In Intelligent Edge, we grew revenues 53% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, delivering record revenues for a fifth consecutive quarter. Customers are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as Edge Connect SD-WAN software and our Aruba Central management platform. We've expanded the Axis Security and SASE funnel to 6 times since the acquisition. Our operating margin of 29.7% was up more than 1,300 basis points year-over-year and 280 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from revenue scale and prior pricing actions, which are helping us build visibility into the durability of our mid-20% margin target over time. While we're making progress on our order book, we expect to carry an above-normal order book into FY '24. In HPC & AI, revenue grew 3% year-over-year. Customer discussions on large language models and generative AI that began in Q1 turned to wins in Q2 and are now showing up as as-a-service orders in Q3. AI, the predominant driver of our 122% year-over-year growth in as-a-service dollars has also driven sequential growth in our corporate total order book, which I'll discuss in a moment. We expect AI deals to provide gross margin rates above historical levels. We believe building and operating large AI models requires unique computational capabilities, including silicon and software that our HPE Cray supercomputers and HPC & AI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable. As for operating margin, our Q3 performance was just below breakeven. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key components and long lead times in this segment mean that operating margins in HPC & AI will continue to fluctuate. We'll discuss our outlook for revenue growth, investment and margin improvement at our Securities Analyst Meeting. Storage fell 2% year-over-year but rose 3% sequentially. HPE Alletra revenue grew triple digits in Q3 for the fifth consecutive quarter. It is now one of our higher revenue products and thus growth rates may normalize. This product is shifting our mix within Storage to higher-margin, software-intensive revenue and is a key driver of our ARR growth. We'll continue to invest in R&D and our owned IP products in this business unit, such as our new file-as-a-service and HPE Alletra MP offerings. Q3 '23 operating margin of 10.7% is down 360 basis points year-over-year as we transition to HPE Alletra. HP Alletra includes a meaningful component of ratable revenue, which pushes revenue recognition out into future periods. Compute revenue was down 10% year-over-year to $2.6 billion and down 5% sequentially. Deal elongation challenges we've discussed previously were most prevalent in the Compute business as some customers digest prior investments. Declining AUPs from a record high in Q1 '23 was also a significant driver. But, as previously noted, we did see sequential demand improvement. And after six quarters of above plan operating margins in Compute, this quarter's 10.9% was a shade below our long-term margin target of 11% to 13%. HPE Financial Services revenues rose 7% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.7 billion grew 6% in constant currency, driven by HPE GreenLake. Our operating margins were down 340 basis points year-over-year, reflecting rapid interest hikes and higher cost of funds that will gradually offset over time through pricing, as well as lower asset management margins as supply challenges ease. Time and time again, HPE FS has proven resilient in a downturn, thanks to the quality underwriting of our book of business. Throughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%, and our Q3 loss ratio of 0.48% was even lower than it was in the full year 2019 pre-pandemic. Slide 9 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. The progress we're making against our edge-to-cloud strategy is evident in the financial results we delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We've held our revenue steady this quarter and expanded non-GAAP diluted net EPS year-over-year despite an uneven spending environment, our transition towards a recurring revenue model and FX rates remaining a significant headwind. FX was a 280 basis point headwind to revenue growth in Q3. On Slide 10, we've included a new depiction of our portfolio shift, which illustrates just how significant the Intelligent Edge business has become for HPE. Even three years ago, Intelligent Edge constituted just 10% of revenue, and this quarter, it represents 20%. Operating profit trajectory is even more dramatic. Edge contributed just over 10% of operating profit three years ago and is now 49% of total segment operating profit. We will offer our forward-looking view at our Security Analyst Meeting. Slide 11 illustrates the progress we've made on our gross margin structure. Our Q3 non-GAAP gross margin is up 120 basis points year-over-year despite FX headwinds. Our year-over-year non-GAAP gross profit and margin growth show the success of our strategic portfolio pivot and the pricing actions HPE has taken. Slide 12 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margin, which was 10.3% in Q3. This is down 20 basis points year-over-year, also inclusive of FX headwinds, and 120 basis points sequentially. While the primary driver of the sequential decline was the return of Compute operating margins to near our target range, we also made certain targeted investments in the quarter to further enable our pivot. Our deliberate portfolio mix shift, pricing strategies and productivity focus put us on track to increase operating margin in FY '23. On Slide 13, as previously announced, we exercised the put option on our shares in H3C and signed a put share purchase agreement that values our 49% H3C stake at US$3.5 billion. The next step in the process is to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and to conclude certain conditions necessary for closing. We expect to conclude this process in the first half of calendar year 2024; although this time line could be further extended pursuant to the terms of our agreement. We intend to update our plans for the use of proceeds once the transaction closes. You can assume that we will use the same disciplined returns-based framework for evaluating investments, capital returns and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating that we've outlined in the past. Finally, we continue to benefit from H3C dividends in FY '23. We'll offer an update on our go-forward expectations for H3C dividend at SAM in October. Now to Slide 14. We generated $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations and $955 million in free cash flow. Our Q3 free cash flow improved by approximately $670 million sequentially and nearly $370 million year-over-year. Similar to our Q4 '22 performance, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of FY '23 and are reiterating our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in free cash flow in FY '23. The timing of receipts and payments plus inventory investments have held cash conversion cycle steady sequentially at 23 days. We expect to exit the year with a neutral cash conversion cycle. Now let's turn to outlook on Slide 15. As we've mentioned, the broader IT market is still pressured. Macro uncertainty is affecting some of our end markets, yet customer investment is rising in others, such as Edge and HPC & AI. We believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive share gains in key markets. We are also entering Q4 with an order book that is more than 2 times pre-pandemic levels. Our order book has increased from more than 1.5 times pre-pandemic levels entering Q3, primarily on the strength of AI orders. The assumptions in our guidance, which incorporate our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, demand, inflationary pressure, supply and FX rates remain relatively unchanged. We've indicated throughout the fiscal year that our financial performance is likely to be weighted to the first half of the year. We continue to view this as the proper framework for FY '23. For Q4, we expect revenues in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.36 and $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.48 and $0.52. We're reiterating our prior fiscal year 2023 guidance of 4% to 6% revenue growth in constant currency. We expect FX to be a 300 basis-point revenue headwind from our previously communicated 250 to 300 basis-point headwind. In parallel, we also reiterate our expectation that margin strength from our portfolio mix shift will deliver non-GAAP operating growth of 6% to 7%. We're reiterating our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of between $1.42 and $1.46 due to tax rate differences and additional amortization of intangibles from our recent acquisitions. We're raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from between $2.06 to $2.14 to between $2.11 and $2.15. We reiterate our guidance for free cash flow of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. For OI&E, we benefited this year from higher interest income and FX hedging costs lower than we originally forecasted. The combination of these and other anticipated benefits in the second half of this fiscal year leads us to expect OI&E to be a positive $50 million to $70 million on a full year basis. We had previously expected OI&E to be neutral for the full year. In terms of capital returns, we are maintaining our dividend and expect to return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. So to conclude, the uneven end market demand thus far in FY '23 is an opportunity for HPE to showcase our differentiated portfolio led by HPE GreenLake Hybrid Cloud, Intelligent Edge and HPC & AI, and we'll continue to take the steps required to further accelerate the pivot of our product portfolio and our company towards faster growth, higher margin recurring revenues. We look forward to updating you with HPE's outlook beyond FY '23 at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October. Now let's open it up for questions. Sure. And that's where I'll pick up, Antonio, it was on Alletra. I think we've previously talked to you guys about how this product is really a combination now of a higher software component and that software component does have an element of taking what was prior product revenue and now deferring that onto the balance sheet, about 14% is deferred onto the balance sheet. And so, as we see that work off over time as that product is deployed out, we'll start seeing an inflection point, and that should positively impact revenue as we look forward, particularly into FY '24. And that also has an impact on the margin line, too, as that deferral is deferring software-based revenue that has a higher margin concentration to it. So we would expect to see our operating margins start to recover back to kind of historical levels as well as we look forward to '24. Maybe I'll pick up on the margin side of it, Antonio. Obviously, in these cycle times, we've -- I think we've proven that in down cycles where commodities are declining, causing declines in AUP. We've been able to hold pricing to drive margin. And then as it inflects back and turns back up, we've been able to be leading market leaders on pricing to make sure that we're catching it appropriately on that. So our expectation is as that changes throughout this process, on top of the point that Antonio made about Gen 11 really driving an AUP premium for us, which can also be an impact. We still expect that 11% to 13% operating profit, structural range to be reflective of what our longer-term expectations are."

Finally, after Antonio provides his high-level remarks, Tarek will be referencing the slides and our earnings presentation throughout his prepared remarks. With that, let me turn it over to you, Antonio.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thanks, Kirt, and good afternoon. Thank you everyone for joining today. In the second quarter, HPE increased total revenues, drove larger contributions from recurring revenues, and expanded overall profitability. I attribute this   two primary factors: First, our strategy to build our portfolio to higher growth, higher margin areas is working. And second, we are operating with strong discipline. In a market that continues to be dynamic, we grew our revenue 9% year-over-year to $7 billion. Our annualized revenue run rate or ARR increased 38% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. We grew year-over-year revenue across our key segments except in compute. With our Intelligent Edge and High Performance Computing and AI segments delivering particularly standout growth even though the potential in our HPC and AI segment was somewhat impacted by customer acceptance of certain large deals. HPE achieved exceptional profitability in the second quarter, increasing our non-GAAP gross margins a full 200 basis points to 36.2%, a new record. Our deliberate portfolio mix shift strategy supported by our operating discipline helped us generate a non-GAAP operating margin of 11.5%, up 220 basis points from a year ago. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share rose 18% year-over-year to $0.52 at the high-end of our second quarter outlook. Free cash flow generated in the quarter was nearly $290 million, an increase of about $500 million from the prior year. As a result of our second quarter performance and our expectations of profitability will increase this fiscal year, we are raising our full-year GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance. Tarek will share further details about our full-year updated guidance, including operating profit expectations later in our call. Our portfolio diversification is a clear strength in winning the business of customers who are taking a data first approach to modernize their IT estates. The relevance of our strategy at the edge in hybrid cloud and in AI delivered through our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform is enabling us to navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. In the second quarter, we saw some decline in the health of macroeconomic conditions, causing unevenness in customer demand, particularly in general purpose compute. We also see unevenness when comparing customer size, industry, or geography. European, Asian, and mid-sized company deals are holding up better than expected, while large enterprise businesses and customers in certain sectors such as financial services and manufacturing in North America have been more conservative with their spend. In the last few months, sales cycles have elongated because customers are more reluctant to quickly commit to large projects or some will seek additional internal approvals at the time of the order. We continue to focus on our soft processes to accelerate closing deals wherever possible. Our order book at the end of Q2 remains elevated at more than 1.5x the size of normalized historical levels. In the area of high growth, Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI, and HPE GreenLake business, order books are especially large. Before I provide some business highlights, I want to be sure you saw the announcement we made last Friday related to our relationship with H3C Technologies. After successfully closing negotiations, we announced that UNIS will purchase all our shares in H3C for $3.5 billion in cash, subject to certain required regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Importantly, from the China market perspective, we are pleased that we have agreed to the terms of a new go forward commercial agreement that we will enter with H3C. Tarek will share more in his remarks. Our HPE GreenLake platform continues to power the growth of our software infrastructure and services, capturing more than $10 billion in total contract value for the first time this quarter. HPE GreenLake also drove our ARR to $1.1 billion in the second quarter with an increasing portion coming from margin rich software and services, which now is 66% over total ARR mix. Our other service business continue to expand our opportunities pipeline though orders this quarter dipped slightly 8% year-over-year. This was driven by a very tough competition to fiscal year Q2 2022 when orders more than doubled. We have had a great ramp with our HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise offering, which advances customers hybrid cloud environments with a consistent intuitive cloud operating experience. Global engineering company Danfoss selected HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise as a part of an effort to transform its global IT strategy. With HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise, the company bought its IT to an agile  environment that aligns the right workload on the right platform, all while significantly reducing the carbon footprint. We continue to innovate on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. To complement our organic innovation early this month we completed our acquisition of OpsRamp, whose hybrid digital operations management solutions have enhanced our HPE GreenLake platform by providing visibility, observability, and control across multi-vendor and multi-cloud IT environments. We are already getting very positive feedback from customers and partners. With the integration of OpsRamp technology into the HPE GreenLake in Q3, we enter a $39 billion IT operations management market. HPE GreenLake is a performance driver across our portfolio and we are seeing its value across our business segments. Let me provide a few segment highlights. Intelligent Edge had a standout quarter. HPE Aruba networking has exceeded our expectations in revenue and margin terms. In part because customers are adding more cloud software services to recently deliver infrastructure, which will add to recurring revenue in future quarters. This is the second consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion in revenue in this segment and the eleventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to drive innovation and expand our addressable market at the edge. Through our acquisition of cloud security provider Axis Security, we have expanded our SASE, Secure Access Service Edge offering. And with a soon to close purchase of Athonet, we are doubling down on private 5G. The combination of Axis Security, Athonet, and our world-class HPE Aruba Network and Intelligent Edge capabilities gives HPE one of the most comprehensive connected edge portfolios in the market. We expect this business to continue to grow in the quarters ahead. In our HPC & AI\u2019s business, we saw a significant sequential increase in orders this quarter, with a noteworthy uptick across customer segments from Fortune 500 companies including a large cloud provider to digital native start-ups looking for optimized AI supercomputing solutions. HP is winning in AI because we deliver an end-to-end portfolio designed for the full spectrum of enterprise   and used cases spanning large scale model development, training, and inferencing. Customers are attracted to HPE's market leading super computing capabilities, differentiated Interconnect IP, AI specific software, and services expertise. Since the start of the second quarter, we have won multiple large contracts, totaling more than $800 million from large cloud providers and enterprise customers that will develop, train, and run AI models. Most of these contracts exceed $100 million each. We expect this pipeline to continue to grow and anticipate these deals will generate significant revenue in later quarters. For example, in Q2,  (ph) and AI focused deal with Crusoe Energy, a cloud provider pioneered in infrastructure that taps into stranded energy like wasted methane or tractor renewable energy to power compute resources. Using HPE Cray supercomputers as a generative AI foundation, Crusoe will enable customers to train and  scale AI models in a sustainable way. Crusoe's mission is to align the future of computing with the future of the climate and this deal enables a significant offering of a climate aligned supercomputer service solution. Just last week, the Top 500 supercomputer list was released. And HPE Systems comprised more than one-third of the Top 100 most powerful systems in the world, including Frontier in the number one spot. In this latest evaluation, the performance of Frontier, the world\u2019s first exascale supercomputer jumped by another 8%. In the quarter, we recognized a portion of the total revenue of our second exascale system called Aurora for Argonne National Laboratory. Aurora will develop a series of generative AI models to run on HPE Cray EX supercomputer, which includes HPE Slingshot, a proven Ethernet interconnect that can scale to the systems more than 60,000 GPUs and more than 21,000 CPUs. Aurora is expected to deliver more than two exaflops of peak performance computing. Argonne plans to open the generative AI models to scientific community for a range of research, including an initial focus on accelerating drug discovery and cancer research. AI is a significant profitable growth opportunity for HPE and our shareholders in a space where HPE has unique differentiation evident in the momentum of our business.  In just few weeks, we will host our annual customer event HPE Discover, where we will make breakthrough announcements in HPE GreenLake, hybrid cloud NAI solutions that we anticipate will accelerate the demand for a differentiated portfolio. We hope many of you will join us in Las Vegas to see our strategy and diverse offerings come to life firsthand. In our storage segment, our pivotal IP-owned products continue to get traction in the market, shown by the impressive ramp of HPE Alletra offerings. HPE Alletra revenue increased more than 100% year-over-year. In April, we announced new storage services HPE GreenLake for block storage and HPE GreenLake for file storage. The new services leverage HPE Alletra storage simplified data lifecycle management with an intuitive cloud operations to store manage and protect customer's data wherever it resides. In the month between launch and the close of the quarter, customer orders for the solutions were strong. For example, the Dallas Cowboys selected HPE GreenLake for block storage because they believe the simple management, efficient scale, and high performance delivered by a new solution will add even more value to their IT operations that customer experience. In compute, our continued focus on pricing discipline has added to the segment's profit contribution. We continue to see some sluggishness from large accounts, many of which have placed large orders with industry supply was more constrained. As we look ahead, we are focused on unit growth in other segment of the market. We are executing our strategy and delivering strong results, including year-over-year revenue growth, record gross margin, and expanded earnings. HPE's year-over-year revenue growth, earnings per share expansion, and consistent increase in ARR contribution over the last two-plus years demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and shift in our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-margin areas, rich in software and services. Our strong operational discipline continues to drive operating leverage across the company. I'm personally proud of the 60,000 team members for its commitment to both think and innovation is helping our customers achieve their goals. Our customers are counting on HPE as a key partner to help them capture opportunities ahead from the edge to hybrid cloud to AI. While the macroeconomic environment may introduce more uncertainty in the short-term, I am confident that our winning strategy, diverse portfolio, and continued innovation position us well to deliver for our customers and shareholders. I now would like Tarek to provide business segment details and specifics about our progress. So Tarek, over to you.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. I will start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. As usual, I will reference slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q2 2023 on Slide 4. Let me discuss our Q2 performance details, starting with Slide 5. I would characterize this quarter as solid overall despite the uneven demand indicators across our portfolio, particularly in Compute, with continued demand and outstanding performance in our Intelligent Edge business as a standout. We are very pleased that we are successfully driving further diversification of our business mix towards our higher-growth, higher-margin portfolio of Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI, and HPE GreenLake solutions. During the quarter, net revenues grew 56% year-over-year in Edge, 22% year-over-year in HPC & AI, and the HPE GreenLake ARR grew 38% year-over-year, all in constant currency. The pivot of our portfolio towards higher-growth, higher-margin markets is clearly visible in the expansion of gross margins and our strategy is working. While we remain confident about our fiscal year 2023 and beyond, we are also realistic. Demand through much of the past two years has been above trend as attested by our growing order book over the fiscal year 2020 to 2022 period throughout our business, including Compute, which is very cyclical in nature. Demand shifted from fiscal year 2022 and to uneven in Q1 and was even more uneven in Q2 across our portfolio. While Q2 revenue of $7 billion equates to a healthy 4% year-over-year growth and 9% year-over-year growth in constant currency, revenues were below our prior guidance range of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion. Deal velocity has slowed, particularly in North America and in Compute, and to a lesser extent in Storage. Deal cycles have elongated as customers primarily are larger compute customers digest their investments over the past two years. This trend has been particularly pronounced for compute in the manufacturing and financial services verticals in North America, in part as a result of the loss of confidence in the banking sector. In addition, HPC & AI was affected by several customer acceptances that slipped out of Q2. Despite this, we see several promising indicators. Demand in Q2 grew sequentially, led by HPC & AI and our Intelligent Edge business, Aruba. Aruba continues to grow revenues, both on a year-over-year and on a sequential basis. Overall demand in Compute in the mid-market is stable, including direct enterprise and the channel. Our overall order book at the start of Q3 remains elevated at more than 1.5x normalized historical levels, and we expect a strong momentum in Intelligent Edge to continue. And finally, AI demand is very solid, as you heard from Antonio, and materializing in our pipeline and our order book with several very large deals. More on that later. We also continue to take action to strengthen the portfolio mix shift inorganically across our businesses. We have closed the acquisitions of Axis Security and OpsRamp and are already winning deals with these assets as part of a broader HPE. I am particularly proud that we have finalized an agreement with our partners at UNIS for the sale of our 49% stake through the exercise of our put option for an amount of $3.5 billion. More on that later. In recognition of the Compute weakness, we are adjusting our previously communicated guidance of 5% to 7% revenue growth to 4% to 6% in constant currency. Nevertheless, the combination of our order book, ongoing strength and momentum in Edge and HPC & AI gives us confidence that we will deliver solid FY 2023 revenue growth and remain confident in the 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the FY 2022 to FY 2025 period that we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting in October. Our non-GAAP gross margin reached a high watermark of 36.2%. This is up 200 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. Our margin structure reflects the pivot of our business mix to higher-margin and software-intensive recurring revenue. Our Intelligent Edge business, Aruba was 19% of total revenue in Q2, up 580 basis points year-over-year. And with Q2 sequential revenue growth in Aruba at 15%, we expect Aruba to represent a larger portion of the company's gross and operating profits by the end of fiscal year 2023. As a result, our Q2 2023 non-GAAP operating margin reached 11.5%. This is 220 basis points ahead of Q2 2022 and down just  (ph) from a record performance in Q1 2023. In addition to the portfolio mix shift towards high-margin businesses, we remain focused on cost control and productivity. Antonio and I remain determined to maintain this focus and to grow revenues faster than OpEx over time. Our Q2 margin strength drove GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.52, at the high-end of our guidance range of $0.44 to $0.52. Q2 2023 free cash flow was positive $288 million, an improvement of nearly $500 million over Q2 2022 and $1.6 billion over Q1 2023. We will discuss cash flow in more details later. Having said that, we remain on track to generate between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year. Finally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $155 million in dividends and repurchased $106 million in stock this quarter and are on track to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023. Our year-to-date total capital returns are  (ph), which reflects our confidence in future cash flow generation. Moving to Slide 6. We are very pleased to announce our pivot to as-a-service revenue continues to show strong momentum as ARR surpassed $1.1 billion in Q2 2023. The benefits of easing supply challenges are appearing in our results as ARR growth in constant currency accelerated from 25% in Q4 2022 to 31% in Q1 2023 and now 38% in Q2 2023. Our edge and storage SaaS offerings are the fastest growth components of our as-a-service portfolio. Our as-a-service order decline of 8% in Q2 2023 is a function of a tough compare to Q2 2022, in which orders grew 107% on strength of several large deals. We are comfortable with our robust pipeline, which includes very large enterprise AI wins we recently closed and reiterate our three-year ARR target of a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2025. Most importantly, we continue to make our as-a-service business more valuable with a growing mix of higher-margin software and services recurring revenue. In Q2 2023, our mix of software and services increased another 220 basis points year-over-year to 66%. And we have attained a total TCV well in excess of $10 billion. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. I would like to remind you that all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we grew our revenue 56% year-over-year and exceeded the Rule of 40 for a second consecutive quarter. Most importantly, we grew revenues 15% sequentially and delivered record revenues for a fourth consecutive quarter. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share in some of the largest enterprise customers who are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as Edge Connect SD-WAN software and our Aruba Central management platform. We have now closed our acquisition of Axis Security and are already generating SD-WAN and SASE wins in combination. Our acquisition of private 5G player Athonet is still pending, but already contributing to our pipeline of business. Our operating margin of 26.9% was up more than 1,400 basis points year-over-year and 500 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from scale and a solid order book that continues to grow. And as a result, we are optimistic about the prospects of our Intelligent Edge business in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. In HPC & AI, revenue grew 22% year-over-year. The emergence of large language models and generative AI has prompted many inquiries from our customer base during the past quarter, which are turning into pipeline and orders. In the past few months, we have multiple large enterprise AI wins totaling more than $800 million and counting. This includes large AI as-a-service deals under the GreenLake model. We believe building and operating large AI models requires unique computational capabilities, including silicon and software that our great supercomputers and HPC & AI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable. We expect the AI demand to drive healthy revenue growth in the future and intend to invest organically and inorganically to fully grasp this opportunity as our acquisitions of Determined AI and Pachyderm attest. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key components and non-linked times in this business means that operating margins in the business unit will continue to fluctuate. Storage revenue grew 2% year-over-year. HPE Alletra revenue grew triple digits in Q2 for the fourth consecutive quarter, lifting our total all-flash array growth to 20% year-over-year. HPE Alletra is driving a long-term mix shift to higher-margin, software-intensive as-a-service revenue. We will continue to invest in R&D for our own IP products in this business unit such as our new file-as-a-service and Alletra MP offerings. Our Q2 2023 operating margin of 7.9% is down 390 basis points year-over-year as we navigate uneven demand and migrate to our software-defined HPE Alletra, which includes a significant component of SaaS ratable revenue. Compute revenue was down 3% year-over-year to $2.8 billion and down 20% sequentially. The  and demand softness I discussed previously was most prevalent in the Compute business as our large customers, particularly in manufacturing and financial services in North America, digest the investments they have made in recent years. Our Compute operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our long-term outlook of 11% to 13% for the sixth consecutive quarter, which attests to the quality of our historical book of business. While we are seeing decreasing commodities costs leading to increased competitive price pressure, we are selling three differentiated platforms in the market, Gen10, Gen10+, and Gen11, which should allow a gradual management of margins over time. In HPE Services, which is within our Compute, HPC & AI and Storage segments and excluding HPE GreenLake, orders were down low single digits and revenues were flat year-over-year. HPE Financial Services revenues rose 7% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.7 billion grew 17% in constant currency, driven by HPE GreenLake. Our operating margins were down 280 basis points year-over-year, reflecting rapid interest rate hikes and higher cost of funds that we will gradually offset over time through pricing. Time and time again, this business has proven resilient in a downturn, thanks to the quality of the underlying of the book of business. Throughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our Q2 loss ratio of 50 basis points was below full-year 2019 or pre-pandemic levels. Slide 8 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. We are very pleased with the progress we are making against our edge-to-cloud strategy is evident in the financial results we have delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We have again grown both our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS in Q2 2023 year-over-year, despite our transition towards a recurring revenue model, an uneven spending environment and FX rates remaining a significant headwind that impacted revenue growth by 480 basis points in Q2 2023. Slide 9 illustrates the progress we have made in our gross margin structure. Our Q2 2023 non-GAAP gross margin is up 200 basis points year-over-year. Our growing gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of the strategic pivot of our portfolio and the pricing actions we have taken. With 56% year-over-year growth in constant currency, our Intelligent Edge business was a standout and is now representing 19% of total sales in Q2 2023, up 580 basis points from a year ago. Slide 10 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margin progress, which reached 11.5% in Q2 2023. This is up 220 basis points year-over-year, and it also represents a high watermark for non-GAAP operating profit margin for a Q2 in any year. Again, our portfolio mix shift, pricing strategies, and productivity focus are the primary drivers of our operating margin expansion. The Intelligent Edge business not only represented 19% of revenue in the quarter but did so with a record 26.9% operating margin. Turning to the next slide. As you know, we have chosen to exercise our put options on our shares in H3C. We are pleased to have announced earlier that we and our partner, Unisplendour, have come to an agreement and signed a put share purchase agreement that values our 49% stake in H3C at USD 3.5 billion. The next step in the process is to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and to complete certain conditions necessary for closing. We anticipate that the process to close will require a further 6 to 12 months to complete. However, this time line could be further extended pursuant to the terms of our agreement. We intend to update our plans for the use of proceeds once the transaction closes. You can assume that we will use the same disciplined return-based framework for evaluating investments, capital returns, and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating we have outlined in the past. As part of this framework, we may consider a range of allocation activities, including but not limited to, both organic and strategic investments, return of capital to shareholders, repayment and/or redemption of outstanding debt and general corporate purposes. We have also negotiated the terms of a new go-forward strategic sale agreement to be entered into with H3C that covers the commercial sales, service, and reseller arrangements between the companies. We're firmly committed to serving our customers and to continuing to do business in China through both direct sales and our partner, H3C. Finally, as you see on this slide, we are continuing to benefit from H3C dividends in fiscal year 2023 and we'll provide a more detailed update at SAM in October 2023 as to our go-forward expectations in this area. In Q2 2023, we are pleased to have generated a positive $889 million in cash flow from operations and $288 million in free cash flow. Our free cash flow improved by $1.6 billion sequentially from a seasonally low Q1 2023 and was also nearly $500 million above our Q2 2022 free cash flow. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of fiscal year 2023 and reiterate our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Net income was the primary driver of our positive free cash flow. Working capital continued to be a use of cash in the quarter. The timing of receipts and payments plus continuing inventory investments have lifted our cash conversion cycle to a positive 24 days in Q2 2023. We expect to exit the year with a neutral cash conversion cycle. Also, please remember we have made significant CapEx investments in HPFS volumes to drive future revenue growth in subsequent quarters. Now, let's turn to our outlook on Slide 13. As we have mentioned, demand for our products and services was more uneven in Q2 2023 across our business than it was in Q1 2023. Macro uncertainty is affecting some of our end markets, yet customer investment is rising in other end markets such as Edge and HPC & AI. We believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive market share gains in key markets. We're also entering Q3 2023 still carrying a substantial order book relative to pre-pandemic levels. Let me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure, and FX risk, which represented a 480 basis point headwind to revenue growth in Q2 2023. I would like to remind you that approximately 50% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies. We had indicated at our last earnings announcement that our financial performance in fiscal year 2023 is likely to be more weighted to the first half of the year than is typical. We continue to view that as the proper lens for fiscal year 2023. For Q3 2023, we expect revenues in the range of $6.7 billion to $7.2 billion. At the midpoint of the range, this represents revenues that are stable year-over-year and most importantly, flat sequentially in reported dollars. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.34 to $0.38 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.48. This outlook assumes the current levels of demand we have been experiencing remain relatively unchanged, that we continue to make progress on the delivery of our order book and no further deterioration from FX rates. Given the weakness in Compute demand, we are adjusting our previously communicated fiscal year 2023 guidance of 5% to 7% revenue growth to 4% to 6% in constant currency and expect FX to be a 250 basis point to 300 basis point revenue headwind. In parallel, we also expect our margin strength from portfolio mix shift to deliver non-GAAP operating profit growth of 6% to 7%, which is up from our prior 5% to 6% view. We are lifting our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from $1.40 to $1.48 to a new range of $1.42 to $1.50 and raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from $2.02 to $2.10 to a new range of $2.06 to $2.14. We reiterate our guidance for free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. For I&E, we have benefited in the first half 2023 from FX hedging costs lower than we originally forecasted. The combination of this plus other anticipated benefits in the second half of 2023 now leads us to expect to why I need to be neutral on a full year basis versus our prior expectation of a $20 million to $40 million expense. In terms of capital returns, we expect to return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. And we are maintaining our dividend and expect to repurchase at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023. So to conclude, we see the uneven end market demand in FY 2023 as an opportunity for HPE to accelerate our portfolio pivot to faster growth, higher-margin recurring revenues. Antonio and I look forward to continuing our execution momentum through fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Now with that, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator:  And our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Antonio, can you dig a bit more into the significant outperformance you continue to see in Intelligent Edge? You're gaining share. The market remains strong. I know there's some backlog but it seems as if end demand is also remaining pretty solid. So, as you look at this business, how should we think about seasonality over the coming quarters because it's been so strong in the first half? How do you think about a more normalized growth rate in the business? And just any more color you can give because it has been such a strong performer. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thank you, Shannon. We are incredibly pleased about the performance of Intelligent Edge. If you recall, this has been a story in the making since the acquisition of Aruba in 2015, which I completed. And then in 2018, I committed to invest $4 billion over the next four years. And the result of this growth is a combination of many things: number one, a very differentiated portfolio, which is cloud driven; a lot of what we do is SaaS subscription, which drives a lot of infrastructure in the campus and branch, but now more and more at the edge of the data center. Second is the fact that our team has executed extremely well in targeting growth areas in the market by customer segment and verticals and used cases. And then after that, I will say, the cloud AI experience that we built in the portfolio with the simplicity of use is one of the reasons why customers prefer the HPE Intelligent Edge now delivered to HPE GreenLake offering. And over time, we have added more and more functionality, both organic and inorganically.  I think organically, the AIOps is a point of differentiation for us. We talk about AI these days, but we embedded AI in our HPE Aruba Central, now part of the GreenLake several years ago. We added, obviously, the SD-WAN component of our portfolio through the acquisition of Silver Peak. And now as Tarek said, we have closed the Axis Security. And think about it this way, for every $1 of SD-WAN, it should be $1 of SASE attached to it. That's why it was fundamental for us to bolster that type of capability. And then we are very bullish about the opportunity to provide private 5G as an extension of the connectivity layer with Wi-Fi, LAN, and SD-WAN. And then over time, we're going to continue to grow our data center footprint because of the organic investments we've made over a number of years, which actually, the differentiation comes from the silicon side and, as well as from the software side. 80% plus of our portfolio in the campus and branch has our own silicon. We use our own chipsets. And obviously, the software we deliver to ArubaOS-CX, is programmable to the silicon. So those are the reasons. I think the use cases continue to be very evident in hospitality. Obviously, as the services sector continue to do well, customers want a connected experience. We see that in health care, I see that as a part of my engagement in the health care, since I'm a director in an insurance company. We see that in manufacturing through automation and robotics. If you're not connected, obviously, you can't deliver any of that. But in the end, it's all about the digitization of enterprise and the first step to digitize in a data-first approach is the connectivity. So that's why we are very bullish about this. I think the business will continue to grow double-digits. That's why we laid out a few quarters back the Rule of 40 whatever is the mix of growth and profit. But so far, we have blown through the Rule of 40. If you add 56 and the 27, that's pretty much a Rule of 80-plus. And so that obviously is not sustainable, but we're gaining share and that's what really matters.\nShannon Cross : Great. Thank you.\nKirt Karros: Thank you Shannon. We\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe I can ask you on the AI pipeline that you discussed a few times on the call. How are you thinking about the land and expand opportunities as you sort of engage with these customers? I know you referenced a $800 million pipeline that you booked recently. And any insights into how competitive are these deals versus some of your sort of traditional supercomputer wins that you have, sort of completed for wins around? And just finally a quick follow-up, Slingshot and interconnect technology, how do you see that sort of evolving as becoming maybe a secondary, sort of source to NVIDIA in sort of the interconnect technology? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Thank you. Obviously, what have been experienced in AI is simply amazing, breathtaking in some cases. I consider AI a massive inflection point, no different than Web 1.0 or mobile in different decades. But obviously, the potential to disrupt every industry, to advance many of the challenges we all face every day through data insights, it's just astonishing. And HPE has a unique opportunity in that market because ultimately, you need a what I call a hybrid AI strategy. You need strong inference at the edge. And that really comped by being able to connect and process data, whatever is created with very efficient and low carbon footprint, meaning sustainable solutions with lower power consumption. And then on the other side, you need a training environment where you take some part of the data, where you can train for different needs, different models for different type of used cases. And HPE has a unique portfolio from the inference side all the way to the training side. So, our HPE ProLiant has already some very powerful cost-efficient solutions at the inference. The amount of computational power, now we can put in one of these, what I call,  (ph) servers. It's simply amazing. And there are different types of configurations that we need to go through to accelerate the GPUs and the like and sometimes, CPUs, by the way.  And on the other side, obviously on the training side, you need a scale type of models with very specialized stacks, and that's where HPE, through organic and inorganic acquisition, really excel because delivering this large amount of GPUs as a coherent system requires enormous expertise. And that's where HPE has unique differentiation in delivering AI at scale through supercomputing. Think about the old tech become the new tech in many ways. Second is unique IP and you named HPE Slingshot. HPE Slingshot is the true Ethernet fabric that's very efficient from both cost and power consumption to chain up to, in this case, like Aurora, 60,000 GPUs. And by the way, it's open because we can support any type of GPUs. Obviously, NVIDIA right now is a hot commodity, but think about Frontier, it was all AMD. And in the case of Aurora, it's all Intel. And we are building a lot of NVIDIA systems in partnership with NVIDIA. So, we can support that in an open environment. The other piece of this is the fact that HP has unique software. In order to present the system in a coherent way, you need software to manage contention of resources because the most important metric for developers is the starting and the completion of the model. And many developers we have been working with, not the traditional run type, but people are developing these large language models are telling us, \u2018sometimes, we try systems in an open cloud environment, it doesn't start for us. Sometimes we can't complete the model.\u2019 Is that's the unique expertise that we bring, because we now have to do that at scale. And then last, but not least, it's very important. Our aspiration is not just AI in the system infrastructure level. We already have, through the acquisition of HPE Cray today, a lot of software that actually provides the packages to train these models. And then in addition to the acquisition of Pachyderm and Determined AI, where we focus on the simplicity to prepare the data, to automate the data pipeline and eventually to train that data. And I think you will hear more about this in a couple of weeks when we go to HPE Discovery in Las Vegas. So, I would recommend you follow us because you will see some breakthrough announcements in the way we provide this AI solution from edge or inference all the way to the training model in a way that every type of customer can get access to our HPE GreenLake platform.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nKirt Karros: Thank you, Samik. We\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: The next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just get a better understanding about how you're thinking about the server cycle. And what I'm pondering here is, some of the third-party market researchers are predicting a rebound in server sales in calendar 2024, particularly coming from enterprise and telco operators. And that's been, I think, strong verticals for you. How are you thinking about how this cycle that you're \u2013 you highlighted the demand absorption that's occurring now, how do you see this playing out over multiple quarters?\nAntonio Neri: Well, Simon, we will be there. I mean, obviously, we have a large footprint. We participate in many of the verticals you described. In the short-term, obviously, we see a significant challenge in Financial Services. Tarek talked about that, called it the crisis of the Financial Services where the large deals that normally happen are now elongated or waiting to get longer approvals and the like. But there is also a lot of digestion and deflationary that's taking place on the commodity space as well, but there is no supply chain challenges. So, maybe just in time, orders works fine because now we can deliver servers in what I call pre-pandemic SLAs, right? So, that's a positive news. Now, it's hard to predict, to be honest with you. We commented that Europe and Asia and mid-market, things seems to be holding up. I agree with you the telco should be a growing opportunity. And listen, we have a very optimized compute platform for virtualization and round deployments. We have very strong partnerships with the equipment providers. We have a platform called HPE ProLiant 110 that's really very specialized for the virtualization of the brand. And as 5G deployments take hold, we expect to capture a size of that. But right now, it's a little bit blurry, and that's why with Tarek, we felt prudent and pragmatic, in many ways, to readjust that guidance for the short term. Ultimately, I think, I believe long term, there is a growth opportunity driven by the growth of data we see in the market. That data needs to be processed. The world is hybrid, so the balance between the public cloud and on-prem of colocations and now the edge continues to be there. I think form factors are evolving at the same time. But I think it comes down to the unit growth and the unit growth of what average unit price. These systems are becoming well more dense and more intelligent in any way. But at the same time, think about units and then attach rates and then what happened with the cost of commodity. So, there will be unit growth. I think there will be segments that will drive unit growth, but we have to see a little bit more before we can call that growth at this point in time.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nKirt Karros: Thank you, Simon. We\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: The next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the Intelligent Edge discussion, if I may. And I think your growth and margin are both obviously very impressive here. I think the growth rate is higher than what Arista is doing. So, maybe just spend a little bit of time on you. How much of this growth is really end demand-driven versus perhaps backlog liquidation-driven? Just anything on the backlog and what's happening over there would be helpful? And then I guess, Antonio, as you think about Intelligent Edge, your stock price clearly is not reflecting all the value that this segment is creating for your customers. So, I'm wondering, have you looked at a thought about different ways to unlock the potential value over time? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thank you for the question. I hope you will be writing about this because to your point, right, we are not getting credit for the stellar performance. And honestly, a story in the making for a number of quarters, right? So, this was the 11th consecutive quarters of growth for that business, which is very impressive in my mind. And I think Tarek had a little bit of challenge saying 1,400 basis points. I mean, normally, 100-plus or 200-plus, but 1,400, it was a little bit awkward to say it. And I think it's because A, we have that unique differentiation and the software that makes the portfolio so special in many ways, and that's what customers are attracted to. Now, as I think about what is driving, I think it's basically demand rolling through that very large order book. And as I said in my remarks, the order book for both the Intelligent Edge and AI remains very, very large, and that demand improved sequentially, as Tarek said. And so, we keep trying to work that order book, but we keep feeding our order book with sequential growth in that demand. We don't believe the demand is poised to go down significantly from here. In fact, we believe it's going to be somewhat steady. But that's why we need to keep innovating and keep adding functionalities and capability to that portfolio. As Tarek said, 19%, almost of the revenue now is coming from this portfolio. And this portfolio enable us to build scale, also and allows us to build the as-a-service model because a lot of what we have done with GreenLake came from the extraction of the cloud coming from this business that we expanded in the rest of the portfolio in hybrid cloud and AI. So, it's a very important critical business. I think the market is starting to see a sizing increase before they give us credit, but I think now everybody has to take notice of that.\nTarek Robbiati: And Amit, if I can add to what Antonio said. I mean, this market is healthy, and it will continue to grow in the upper single digits for several years to come. We're very comfortable with this. We're also investing in adjacent TAMs. Antonio spoke about SASE, private 5G, but also data center networking, for us is a massive opportunity that we're going after. We're generating already a lot of revenues in there. Aruba today represented 19% of total revenues in Q2. If you really look at where we were at the end of fiscal year 2022, to put things in perspective, we were only at 13% of total revenues. So, we believe we now will be stably in the high teens as a percentage of revenues for the whole of the company. And then I'll let you do the math with regards to how much Aruba will represent as a percentage of total operating profit of the company.  So, Aruba is absolutely core. And you know that when we pass the 15% mark of total revenue, the stock market should take notice about that. And by way of comparison, if you compare Aruba in size to its next competitor, Juniper, it has roughly the same revenue at the end of the second quarter, but Juniper has 14% operating profit margin and Aruba is at 26.9%. That speaks volumes about the performance of Aruba.\nAntonio Neri: And I would say, you asked a question, how you consider unlocking the value? I mean, as you can expect, I mean, we really review with our Board strategy to maximize value for our shareholder. But we believe the edge is critical to our strategy because it's aligned to the customer need. You need the connectivity to drive the digital transformation. Without that is incomplete. At the same time, I know I talked about the leverage of the edge portfolio and the cloud for the rest of the company. And also, let's remind ourselves, we have cross-selling opportunities because once we land the customer on HPE GreenLake, whether it's through the edge or through the hybrid cloud and now through the AI as we go forward, you will see the opportunity to cross-sell, which benefit Aruba and the Intelligent Edge as a whole and the rest of the company as well.\nKirt Karros: Thank you, Amit. We\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could maybe share some color on your comments regarding deal velocity slowdown both in Compute and Storage, and you noted manufacturing and financial services verticals, in particular for Compute. Can you share some color on how linearity was in the quarter? And are you baking in an increased deceleration in other verticals as you look at your back half of the year? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Thanks, Wamsi. I think Tarek mentioned that we assume in our guidance current level of demand and no further deterioration. Demand on Compute was slightly down from the previous quarter, compared to everything else that was up sequentially. And so from our vantage point, we believe we have covered this in the guidance. I think from the deterioration, I think it was clear when the financial crisis started sometime in March. We saw a deceleration and that was very evident in the financial sector, right, so the financial vertical, I will say. But that said, it is the most uneven parts of the portfolio, as we commented. I think it's driven by the digestion of our customers' order last year. The fact that today, they are maybe prioritizing investments in the edge or prioritizing investment in AI, which clearly we are a benefactor of it from that perspective. I think customers are looking for resilience as well, considering everything that's happening around the globe. And then also understanding what's happening with the cost of the commodities as we go to this transition. And ultimately, at some point, right, we see what the consumer market is going to do because the consumer is a driver of data as well. And so, we need to understand those trends. But I will say from that vantage point, I think clearly the Compute market as a whole, and this is important we segment this because sometimes people refer to Compute as servers. We don't refer that as servers. We refer that as a specific general purpose compute. The servers include, obviously, high-performance computing and other form factors. But in that space, clearly, is the most uneven at this time.\nKirt Karros: Thank you, Wamsi. And operator, we have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you for taking my question. I'm just wondering if you can just help triangulate some of the numbers around backlog that were highlighted on the call. So, I think backlog exiting last quarter was 2x normal. Exiting this quarter was 1.5x normal so it came down quite a bit, but you added $800 million in orders in the Intelligent Edge business. So that would suggest there was like really dramatic drawdown, like $1 billion-plus of backlog, in other businesses. So is that the right way to think about it or am I triangulating it incorrectly? And also how do \u2013 you keep saying that demand improved this quarter versus last quarter, but revenue was down and you drew down a lot of backlog. So, I'm also just trying to reconcile that. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. So, a couple of things I'll correct. So, last quarter, right, we exited with an order book that was 2x historical levels, and we refer to historical levels to pre-pandemic, Toni. And then this quarter, we're exiting 1.5x. What is different is that the mix of that order book is different, right? Because obviously, the growth we have in Intelligent Edge and AI is substantial, obviously. But the 800 million, I want to clarify that for you, Toni. The 800 million was just in the AI space. And every segment grew sequentially orders, except Compute, which was very  (ph) single-digits demand decline. And so clearly, when you want to isolate, it's Compute, it's Compute particularly in North America, it's Compute particularly in these two segments we described, financial services and manufacturing. But the mix of the order book has shifted because now the larger of the book is actually in the Intelligent Edge and it is in AI. And the 800 million I described earlier are all 100% orders that we got in the AI space because we saw a significant uptick, and that came from Fortune 500 companies, some of these digital-native large language models companies and a large cloud provider. But ultimately, that's what's happening. And the Compute \u2013 that's why we are readjusting that guidance on revenue because of the unevenness in Compute. But overall, we are, as a total company, 1.5x where normally we should be.\nToni Sacconaghi: Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Well, thank you for all your comments, and we appreciate you attending today the call. I mean, I will leave with a simple message, right. So, I think overall, HPE had a very solid quarter. Obviously, we were not at the total revenue consensus as people put out there. But the fact of the matter, we grew revenues. We significantly grew our recurring revenues, and we had an exceptional profitability for the quarter. And this was driven by our pivot, and you can see the pivot and the meaningful impact that Intelligent Edge and AI is having to our business. We didn't spoke a lot about Storage, but Storage grew 2%. And at the same time, the Alletra platform, which is a software-defined platform, grew in excess of 100% and a big portion of that revenue is actually deferred. So, I think in the short-term, we're going to navigate this uneven demand in Compute, but we are very pleased about the momentum we have in hybrid cloud with GreenLake, AI and which is a massive, massive opportunity for the company with a unique differentiation and obviously, the Intelligent Edge, which is delivering a standout performance this quarter after quarter after quarter. So, with that, I hope to see you at HPE Discovery in Vegas in three weeks because we have some amazing announcements that we want to share with you that will continue to drive momentum in our business. So, thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Kirt, and good afternoon. Thank you everyone for joining today. In the second quarter, HPE increased total revenues, drove larger contributions from recurring revenues, and expanded overall profitability. I attribute this   two primary factors: First, our strategy to build our portfolio to higher growth, higher margin areas is working. And second, we are operating with strong discipline. In a market that continues to be dynamic, we grew our revenue 9% year-over-year to $7 billion. Our annualized revenue run rate or ARR increased 38% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. We grew year-over-year revenue across our key segments except in compute. With our Intelligent Edge and High Performance Computing and AI segments delivering particularly standout growth even though the potential in our HPC and AI segment was somewhat impacted by customer acceptance of certain large deals. HPE achieved exceptional profitability in the second quarter, increasing our non-GAAP gross margins a full 200 basis points to 36.2%, a new record. Our deliberate portfolio mix shift strategy supported by our operating discipline helped us generate a non-GAAP operating margin of 11.5%, up 220 basis points from a year ago. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share rose 18% year-over-year to $0.52 at the high-end of our second quarter outlook. Free cash flow generated in the quarter was nearly $290 million, an increase of about $500 million from the prior year. As a result of our second quarter performance and our expectations of profitability will increase this fiscal year, we are raising our full-year GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance. Tarek will share further details about our full-year updated guidance, including operating profit expectations later in our call. Our portfolio diversification is a clear strength in winning the business of customers who are taking a data first approach to modernize their IT estates. The relevance of our strategy at the edge in hybrid cloud and in AI delivered through our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform is enabling us to navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. In the second quarter, we saw some decline in the health of macroeconomic conditions, causing unevenness in customer demand, particularly in general purpose compute. We also see unevenness when comparing customer size, industry, or geography. European, Asian, and mid-sized company deals are holding up better than expected, while large enterprise businesses and customers in certain sectors such as financial services and manufacturing in North America have been more conservative with their spend. In the last few months, sales cycles have elongated because customers are more reluctant to quickly commit to large projects or some will seek additional internal approvals at the time of the order. We continue to focus on our soft processes to accelerate closing deals wherever possible. Our order book at the end of Q2 remains elevated at more than 1.5x the size of normalized historical levels. In the area of high growth, Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI, and HPE GreenLake business, order books are especially large. Before I provide some business highlights, I want to be sure you saw the announcement we made last Friday related to our relationship with H3C Technologies. After successfully closing negotiations, we announced that UNIS will purchase all our shares in H3C for $3.5 billion in cash, subject to certain required regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Importantly, from the China market perspective, we are pleased that we have agreed to the terms of a new go forward commercial agreement that we will enter with H3C. Tarek will share more in his remarks. Our HPE GreenLake platform continues to power the growth of our software infrastructure and services, capturing more than $10 billion in total contract value for the first time this quarter. HPE GreenLake also drove our ARR to $1.1 billion in the second quarter with an increasing portion coming from margin rich software and services, which now is 66% over total ARR mix. Our other service business continue to expand our opportunities pipeline though orders this quarter dipped slightly 8% year-over-year. This was driven by a very tough competition to fiscal year Q2 2022 when orders more than doubled. We have had a great ramp with our HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise offering, which advances customers hybrid cloud environments with a consistent intuitive cloud operating experience. Global engineering company Danfoss selected HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise as a part of an effort to transform its global IT strategy. With HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise, the company bought its IT to an agile  environment that aligns the right workload on the right platform, all while significantly reducing the carbon footprint. We continue to innovate on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. To complement our organic innovation early this month we completed our acquisition of OpsRamp, whose hybrid digital operations management solutions have enhanced our HPE GreenLake platform by providing visibility, observability, and control across multi-vendor and multi-cloud IT environments. We are already getting very positive feedback from customers and partners. With the integration of OpsRamp technology into the HPE GreenLake in Q3, we enter a $39 billion IT operations management market. HPE GreenLake is a performance driver across our portfolio and we are seeing its value across our business segments. Let me provide a few segment highlights. Intelligent Edge had a standout quarter. HPE Aruba networking has exceeded our expectations in revenue and margin terms. In part because customers are adding more cloud software services to recently deliver infrastructure, which will add to recurring revenue in future quarters. This is the second consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion in revenue in this segment and the eleventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to drive innovation and expand our addressable market at the edge. Through our acquisition of cloud security provider Axis Security, we have expanded our SASE, Secure Access Service Edge offering. And with a soon to close purchase of Athonet, we are doubling down on private 5G. The combination of Axis Security, Athonet, and our world-class HPE Aruba Network and Intelligent Edge capabilities gives HPE one of the most comprehensive connected edge portfolios in the market. We expect this business to continue to grow in the quarters ahead. In our HPC & AI's business, we saw a significant sequential increase in orders this quarter, with a noteworthy uptick across customer segments from Fortune 500 companies including a large cloud provider to digital native start-ups looking for optimized AI supercomputing solutions. HP is winning in AI because we deliver an end-to-end portfolio designed for the full spectrum of enterprise   and used cases spanning large scale model development, training, and inferencing. Customers are attracted to HPE's market leading super computing capabilities, differentiated Interconnect IP, AI specific software, and services expertise. Since the start of the second quarter, we have won multiple large contracts, totaling more than $800 million from large cloud providers and enterprise customers that will develop, train, and run AI models. Most of these contracts exceed $100 million each. We expect this pipeline to continue to grow and anticipate these deals will generate significant revenue in later quarters. For example, in Q2,  (ph) and AI focused deal with Crusoe Energy, a cloud provider pioneered in infrastructure that taps into stranded energy like wasted methane or tractor renewable energy to power compute resources. Using HPE Cray supercomputers as a generative AI foundation, Crusoe will enable customers to train and  scale AI models in a sustainable way. Crusoe's mission is to align the future of computing with the future of the climate and this deal enables a significant offering of a climate aligned supercomputer service solution. Just last week, the Top 500 supercomputer list was released. And HPE Systems comprised more than one-third of the Top 100 most powerful systems in the world, including Frontier in the number one spot. In this latest evaluation, the performance of Frontier, the world's first exascale supercomputer jumped by another 8%. In the quarter, we recognized a portion of the total revenue of our second exascale system called Aurora for Argonne National Laboratory. Aurora will develop a series of generative AI models to run on HPE Cray EX supercomputer, which includes HPE Slingshot, a proven Ethernet interconnect that can scale to the systems more than 60,000 GPUs and more than 21,000 CPUs. Aurora is expected to deliver more than two exaflops of peak performance computing. Argonne plans to open the generative AI models to scientific community for a range of research, including an initial focus on accelerating drug discovery and cancer research. AI is a significant profitable growth opportunity for HPE and our shareholders in a space where HPE has unique differentiation evident in the momentum of our business.  In just few weeks, we will host our annual customer event HPE Discover, where we will make breakthrough announcements in HPE GreenLake, hybrid cloud NAI solutions that we anticipate will accelerate the demand for a differentiated portfolio. We hope many of you will join us in Las Vegas to see our strategy and diverse offerings come to life firsthand. In our storage segment, our pivotal IP-owned products continue to get traction in the market, shown by the impressive ramp of HPE Alletra offerings. HPE Alletra revenue increased more than 100% year-over-year. In April, we announced new storage services HPE GreenLake for block storage and HPE GreenLake for file storage. The new services leverage HPE Alletra storage simplified data lifecycle management with an intuitive cloud operations to store manage and protect customer's data wherever it resides. In the month between launch and the close of the quarter, customer orders for the solutions were strong. For example, the Dallas Cowboys selected HPE GreenLake for block storage because they believe the simple management, efficient scale, and high performance delivered by a new solution will add even more value to their IT operations that customer experience. In compute, our continued focus on pricing discipline has added to the segment's profit contribution. We continue to see some sluggishness from large accounts, many of which have placed large orders with industry supply was more constrained. As we look ahead, we are focused on unit growth in other segment of the market. We are executing our strategy and delivering strong results, including year-over-year revenue growth, record gross margin, and expanded earnings. HPE's year-over-year revenue growth, earnings per share expansion, and consistent increase in ARR contribution over the last two-plus years demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and shift in our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-margin areas, rich in software and services. Our strong operational discipline continues to drive operating leverage across the company. I'm personally proud of the 60,000 team members for its commitment to both think and innovation is helping our customers achieve their goals. Our customers are counting on HPE as a key partner to help them capture opportunities ahead from the edge to hybrid cloud to AI. While the macroeconomic environment may introduce more uncertainty in the short-term, I am confident that our winning strategy, diverse portfolio, and continued innovation position us well to deliver for our customers and shareholders. I now would like Tarek to provide business segment details and specifics about our progress. So Tarek, over to you. Well, thank you, Shannon. We are incredibly pleased about the performance of Intelligent Edge. If you recall, this has been a story in the making since the acquisition of Aruba in 2015, which I completed. And then in 2018, I committed to invest $4 billion over the next four years. And the result of this growth is a combination of many things: number one, a very differentiated portfolio, which is cloud driven; a lot of what we do is SaaS subscription, which drives a lot of infrastructure in the campus and branch, but now more and more at the edge of the data center. Second is the fact that our team has executed extremely well in targeting growth areas in the market by customer segment and verticals and used cases. And then after that, I will say, the cloud AI experience that we built in the portfolio with the simplicity of use is one of the reasons why customers prefer the HPE Intelligent Edge now delivered to HPE GreenLake offering. And over time, we have added more and more functionality, both organic and inorganically.  I think organically, the AIOps is a point of differentiation for us. We talk about AI these days, but we embedded AI in our HPE Aruba Central, now part of the GreenLake several years ago. We added, obviously, the SD-WAN component of our portfolio through the acquisition of Silver Peak. And now as Tarek said, we have closed the Axis Security. And think about it this way, for every $1 of SD-WAN, it should be $1 of SASE attached to it. That's why it was fundamental for us to bolster that type of capability. And then we are very bullish about the opportunity to provide private 5G as an extension of the connectivity layer with Wi-Fi, LAN, and SD-WAN. And then over time, we're going to continue to grow our data center footprint because of the organic investments we've made over a number of years, which actually, the differentiation comes from the silicon side and, as well as from the software side. 80% plus of our portfolio in the campus and branch has our own silicon. We use our own chipsets. And obviously, the software we deliver to ArubaOS-CX, is programmable to the silicon. So those are the reasons. I think the use cases continue to be very evident in hospitality. Obviously, as the services sector continue to do well, customers want a connected experience. We see that in health care, I see that as a part of my engagement in the health care, since I'm a director in an insurance company. We see that in manufacturing through automation and robotics. If you're not connected, obviously, you can't deliver any of that. But in the end, it's all about the digitization of enterprise and the first step to digitize in a data-first approach is the connectivity. So that's why we are very bullish about this. I think the business will continue to grow double-digits. That's why we laid out a few quarters back the Rule of 40 whatever is the mix of growth and profit. But so far, we have blown through the Rule of 40. If you add 56 and the 27, that's pretty much a Rule of 80-plus. And so that obviously is not sustainable, but we're gaining share and that's what really matters. Thank you. Obviously, what have been experienced in AI is simply amazing, breathtaking in some cases. I consider AI a massive inflection point, no different than Web 1.0 or mobile in different decades. But obviously, the potential to disrupt every industry, to advance many of the challenges we all face every day through data insights, it's just astonishing. And HPE has a unique opportunity in that market because ultimately, you need a what I call a hybrid AI strategy. You need strong inference at the edge. And that really comped by being able to connect and process data, whatever is created with very efficient and low carbon footprint, meaning sustainable solutions with lower power consumption. And then on the other side, you need a training environment where you take some part of the data, where you can train for different needs, different models for different type of used cases. And HPE has a unique portfolio from the inference side all the way to the training side. So, our HPE ProLiant has already some very powerful cost-efficient solutions at the inference. The amount of computational power, now we can put in one of these, what I call,  (ph) servers. It's simply amazing. And there are different types of configurations that we need to go through to accelerate the GPUs and the like and sometimes, CPUs, by the way.  And on the other side, obviously on the training side, you need a scale type of models with very specialized stacks, and that's where HPE, through organic and inorganic acquisition, really excel because delivering this large amount of GPUs as a coherent system requires enormous expertise. And that's where HPE has unique differentiation in delivering AI at scale through supercomputing. Think about the old tech become the new tech in many ways. Second is unique IP and you named HPE Slingshot. HPE Slingshot is the true Ethernet fabric that's very efficient from both cost and power consumption to chain up to, in this case, like Aurora, 60,000 GPUs. And by the way, it's open because we can support any type of GPUs. Obviously, NVIDIA right now is a hot commodity, but think about Frontier, it was all AMD. And in the case of Aurora, it's all Intel. And we are building a lot of NVIDIA systems in partnership with NVIDIA. So, we can support that in an open environment. The other piece of this is the fact that HP has unique software. In order to present the system in a coherent way, you need software to manage contention of resources because the most important metric for developers is the starting and the completion of the model. And many developers we have been working with, not the traditional run type, but people are developing these large language models are telling us, \u2018sometimes, we try systems in an open cloud environment, it doesn't start for us. Sometimes we can't complete the model.' Is that's the unique expertise that we bring, because we now have to do that at scale. And then last, but not least, it's very important. Our aspiration is not just AI in the system infrastructure level. We already have, through the acquisition of HPE Cray today, a lot of software that actually provides the packages to train these models. And then in addition to the acquisition of Pachyderm and Determined AI, where we focus on the simplicity to prepare the data, to automate the data pipeline and eventually to train that data. And I think you will hear more about this in a couple of weeks when we go to HPE Discovery in Las Vegas. So, I would recommend you follow us because you will see some breakthrough announcements in the way we provide this AI solution from edge or inference all the way to the training model in a way that every type of customer can get access to our HPE GreenLake platform. Well, Simon, we will be there. I mean, obviously, we have a large footprint. We participate in many of the verticals you described. In the short-term, obviously, we see a significant challenge in Financial Services. Tarek talked about that, called it the crisis of the Financial Services where the large deals that normally happen are now elongated or waiting to get longer approvals and the like. But there is also a lot of digestion and deflationary that's taking place on the commodity space as well, but there is no supply chain challenges. So, maybe just in time, orders works fine because now we can deliver servers in what I call pre-pandemic SLAs, right? So, that's a positive news. Now, it's hard to predict, to be honest with you. We commented that Europe and Asia and mid-market, things seems to be holding up. I agree with you the telco should be a growing opportunity. And listen, we have a very optimized compute platform for virtualization and round deployments. We have very strong partnerships with the equipment providers. We have a platform called HPE ProLiant 110 that's really very specialized for the virtualization of the brand. And as 5G deployments take hold, we expect to capture a size of that. But right now, it's a little bit blurry, and that's why with Tarek, we felt prudent and pragmatic, in many ways, to readjust that guidance for the short term. Ultimately, I think, I believe long term, there is a growth opportunity driven by the growth of data we see in the market. That data needs to be processed. The world is hybrid, so the balance between the public cloud and on-prem of colocations and now the edge continues to be there. I think form factors are evolving at the same time. But I think it comes down to the unit growth and the unit growth of what average unit price. These systems are becoming well more dense and more intelligent in any way. But at the same time, think about units and then attach rates and then what happened with the cost of commodity. So, there will be unit growth. I think there will be segments that will drive unit growth, but we have to see a little bit more before we can call that growth at this point in time. Well, thank you for the question. I hope you will be writing about this because to your point, right, we are not getting credit for the stellar performance. And honestly, a story in the making for a number of quarters, right? So, this was the 11th consecutive quarters of growth for that business, which is very impressive in my mind. And I think Tarek had a little bit of challenge saying 1,400 basis points. I mean, normally, 100-plus or 200-plus, but 1,400, it was a little bit awkward to say it. And I think it's because A, we have that unique differentiation and the software that makes the portfolio so special in many ways, and that's what customers are attracted to. Now, as I think about what is driving, I think it's basically demand rolling through that very large order book. And as I said in my remarks, the order book for both the Intelligent Edge and AI remains very, very large, and that demand improved sequentially, as Tarek said. And so, we keep trying to work that order book, but we keep feeding our order book with sequential growth in that demand. We don't believe the demand is poised to go down significantly from here. In fact, we believe it's going to be somewhat steady. But that's why we need to keep innovating and keep adding functionalities and capability to that portfolio. As Tarek said, 19%, almost of the revenue now is coming from this portfolio. And this portfolio enable us to build scale, also and allows us to build the as-a-service model because a lot of what we have done with GreenLake came from the extraction of the cloud coming from this business that we expanded in the rest of the portfolio in hybrid cloud and AI. So, it's a very important critical business. I think the market is starting to see a sizing increase before they give us credit, but I think now everybody has to take notice of that. And I would say, you asked a question, how you consider unlocking the value? I mean, as you can expect, I mean, we really review with our Board strategy to maximize value for our shareholder. But we believe the edge is critical to our strategy because it's aligned to the customer need. You need the connectivity to drive the digital transformation. Without that is incomplete. At the same time, I know I talked about the leverage of the edge portfolio and the cloud for the rest of the company. And also, let's remind ourselves, we have cross-selling opportunities because once we land the customer on HPE GreenLake, whether it's through the edge or through the hybrid cloud and now through the AI as we go forward, you will see the opportunity to cross-sell, which benefit Aruba and the Intelligent Edge as a whole and the rest of the company as well. Thanks, Wamsi. I think Tarek mentioned that we assume in our guidance current level of demand and no further deterioration. Demand on Compute was slightly down from the previous quarter, compared to everything else that was up sequentially. And so from our vantage point, we believe we have covered this in the guidance. I think from the deterioration, I think it was clear when the financial crisis started sometime in March. We saw a deceleration and that was very evident in the financial sector, right, so the financial vertical, I will say. But that said, it is the most uneven parts of the portfolio, as we commented. I think it's driven by the digestion of our customers' order last year. The fact that today, they are maybe prioritizing investments in the edge or prioritizing investment in AI, which clearly we are a benefactor of it from that perspective. I think customers are looking for resilience as well, considering everything that's happening around the globe. And then also understanding what's happening with the cost of the commodities as we go to this transition. And ultimately, at some point, right, we see what the consumer market is going to do because the consumer is a driver of data as well. And so, we need to understand those trends. But I will say from that vantage point, I think clearly the Compute market as a whole, and this is important we segment this because sometimes people refer to Compute as servers. We don't refer that as servers. We refer that as a specific general purpose compute. The servers include, obviously, high-performance computing and other form factors. But in that space, clearly, is the most uneven at this time. Sure. So, a couple of things I'll correct. So, last quarter, right, we exited with an order book that was 2x historical levels, and we refer to historical levels to pre-pandemic, Toni. And then this quarter, we're exiting 1.5x. What is different is that the mix of that order book is different, right? Because obviously, the growth we have in Intelligent Edge and AI is substantial, obviously. But the 800 million, I want to clarify that for you, Toni. The 800 million was just in the AI space. And every segment grew sequentially orders, except Compute, which was very  (ph) single-digits demand decline. And so clearly, when you want to isolate, it's Compute, it's Compute particularly in North America, it's Compute particularly in these two segments we described, financial services and manufacturing. But the mix of the order book has shifted because now the larger of the book is actually in the Intelligent Edge and it is in AI. And the 800 million I described earlier are all 100% orders that we got in the AI space because we saw a significant uptick, and that came from Fortune 500 companies, some of these digital-native large language models companies and a large cloud provider. But ultimately, that's what's happening. And the Compute \u2013 that's why we are readjusting that guidance on revenue because of the unevenness in Compute. But overall, we are, as a total company, 1.5x where normally we should be. Yes. Well, thank you for all your comments, and we appreciate you attending today the call. I mean, I will leave with a simple message, right. So, I think overall, HPE had a very solid quarter. Obviously, we were not at the total revenue consensus as people put out there. But the fact of the matter, we grew revenues. We significantly grew our recurring revenues, and we had an exceptional profitability for the quarter. And this was driven by our pivot, and you can see the pivot and the meaningful impact that Intelligent Edge and AI is having to our business. We didn't spoke a lot about Storage, but Storage grew 2%. And at the same time, the Alletra platform, which is a software-defined platform, grew in excess of 100% and a big portion of that revenue is actually deferred. So, I think in the short-term, we're going to navigate this uneven demand in Compute, but we are very pleased about the momentum we have in hybrid cloud with GreenLake, AI and which is a massive, massive opportunity for the company with a unique differentiation and obviously, the Intelligent Edge, which is delivering a standout performance this quarter after quarter after quarter. So, with that, I hope to see you at HPE Discovery in Vegas in three weeks because we have some amazing announcements that we want to share with you that will continue to drive momentum in our business. So, thank you very much."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. I will start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. As usual, I will reference slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q2 2023 on Slide 4. Let me discuss our Q2 performance details, starting with Slide 5. I would characterize this quarter as solid overall despite the uneven demand indicators across our portfolio, particularly in Compute, with continued demand and outstanding performance in our Intelligent Edge business as a standout. We are very pleased that we are successfully driving further diversification of our business mix towards our higher-growth, higher-margin portfolio of Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI, and HPE GreenLake solutions. During the quarter, net revenues grew 56% year-over-year in Edge, 22% year-over-year in HPC & AI, and the HPE GreenLake ARR grew 38% year-over-year, all in constant currency. The pivot of our portfolio towards higher-growth, higher-margin markets is clearly visible in the expansion of gross margins and our strategy is working. While we remain confident about our fiscal year 2023 and beyond, we are also realistic. Demand through much of the past two years has been above trend as attested by our growing order book over the fiscal year 2020 to 2022 period throughout our business, including Compute, which is very cyclical in nature. Demand shifted from fiscal year 2022 and to uneven in Q1 and was even more uneven in Q2 across our portfolio. While Q2 revenue of $7 billion equates to a healthy 4% year-over-year growth and 9% year-over-year growth in constant currency, revenues were below our prior guidance range of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion. Deal velocity has slowed, particularly in North America and in Compute, and to a lesser extent in Storage. Deal cycles have elongated as customers primarily are larger compute customers digest their investments over the past two years. This trend has been particularly pronounced for compute in the manufacturing and financial services verticals in North America, in part as a result of the loss of confidence in the banking sector. In addition, HPC & AI was affected by several customer acceptances that slipped out of Q2. Despite this, we see several promising indicators. Demand in Q2 grew sequentially, led by HPC & AI and our Intelligent Edge business, Aruba. Aruba continues to grow revenues, both on a year-over-year and on a sequential basis. Overall demand in Compute in the mid-market is stable, including direct enterprise and the channel. Our overall order book at the start of Q3 remains elevated at more than 1.5x normalized historical levels, and we expect a strong momentum in Intelligent Edge to continue. And finally, AI demand is very solid, as you heard from Antonio, and materializing in our pipeline and our order book with several very large deals. More on that later. We also continue to take action to strengthen the portfolio mix shift inorganically across our businesses. We have closed the acquisitions of Axis Security and OpsRamp and are already winning deals with these assets as part of a broader HPE. I am particularly proud that we have finalized an agreement with our partners at UNIS for the sale of our 49% stake through the exercise of our put option for an amount of $3.5 billion. More on that later. In recognition of the Compute weakness, we are adjusting our previously communicated guidance of 5% to 7% revenue growth to 4% to 6% in constant currency. Nevertheless, the combination of our order book, ongoing strength and momentum in Edge and HPC & AI gives us confidence that we will deliver solid FY 2023 revenue growth and remain confident in the 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the FY 2022 to FY 2025 period that we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting in October. Our non-GAAP gross margin reached a high watermark of 36.2%. This is up 200 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. Our margin structure reflects the pivot of our business mix to higher-margin and software-intensive recurring revenue. Our Intelligent Edge business, Aruba was 19% of total revenue in Q2, up 580 basis points year-over-year. And with Q2 sequential revenue growth in Aruba at 15%, we expect Aruba to represent a larger portion of the company's gross and operating profits by the end of fiscal year 2023. As a result, our Q2 2023 non-GAAP operating margin reached 11.5%. This is 220 basis points ahead of Q2 2022 and down just  (ph) from a record performance in Q1 2023. In addition to the portfolio mix shift towards high-margin businesses, we remain focused on cost control and productivity. Antonio and I remain determined to maintain this focus and to grow revenues faster than OpEx over time. Our Q2 margin strength drove GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.52, at the high-end of our guidance range of $0.44 to $0.52. Q2 2023 free cash flow was positive $288 million, an improvement of nearly $500 million over Q2 2022 and $1.6 billion over Q1 2023. We will discuss cash flow in more details later. Having said that, we remain on track to generate between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year. Finally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $155 million in dividends and repurchased $106 million in stock this quarter and are on track to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023. Our year-to-date total capital returns are  (ph), which reflects our confidence in future cash flow generation. Moving to Slide 6. We are very pleased to announce our pivot to as-a-service revenue continues to show strong momentum as ARR surpassed $1.1 billion in Q2 2023. The benefits of easing supply challenges are appearing in our results as ARR growth in constant currency accelerated from 25% in Q4 2022 to 31% in Q1 2023 and now 38% in Q2 2023. Our edge and storage SaaS offerings are the fastest growth components of our as-a-service portfolio. Our as-a-service order decline of 8% in Q2 2023 is a function of a tough compare to Q2 2022, in which orders grew 107% on strength of several large deals. We are comfortable with our robust pipeline, which includes very large enterprise AI wins we recently closed and reiterate our three-year ARR target of a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2025. Most importantly, we continue to make our as-a-service business more valuable with a growing mix of higher-margin software and services recurring revenue. In Q2 2023, our mix of software and services increased another 220 basis points year-over-year to 66%. And we have attained a total TCV well in excess of $10 billion. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. I would like to remind you that all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we grew our revenue 56% year-over-year and exceeded the Rule of 40 for a second consecutive quarter. Most importantly, we grew revenues 15% sequentially and delivered record revenues for a fourth consecutive quarter. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share in some of the largest enterprise customers who are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as Edge Connect SD-WAN software and our Aruba Central management platform. We have now closed our acquisition of Axis Security and are already generating SD-WAN and SASE wins in combination. Our acquisition of private 5G player Athonet is still pending, but already contributing to our pipeline of business. Our operating margin of 26.9% was up more than 1,400 basis points year-over-year and 500 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from scale and a solid order book that continues to grow. And as a result, we are optimistic about the prospects of our Intelligent Edge business in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. In HPC & AI, revenue grew 22% year-over-year. The emergence of large language models and generative AI has prompted many inquiries from our customer base during the past quarter, which are turning into pipeline and orders. In the past few months, we have multiple large enterprise AI wins totaling more than $800 million and counting. This includes large AI as-a-service deals under the GreenLake model. We believe building and operating large AI models requires unique computational capabilities, including silicon and software that our great supercomputers and HPC & AI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable. We expect the AI demand to drive healthy revenue growth in the future and intend to invest organically and inorganically to fully grasp this opportunity as our acquisitions of Determined AI and Pachyderm attest. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key components and non-linked times in this business means that operating margins in the business unit will continue to fluctuate. Storage revenue grew 2% year-over-year. HPE Alletra revenue grew triple digits in Q2 for the fourth consecutive quarter, lifting our total all-flash array growth to 20% year-over-year. HPE Alletra is driving a long-term mix shift to higher-margin, software-intensive as-a-service revenue. We will continue to invest in R&D for our own IP products in this business unit such as our new file-as-a-service and Alletra MP offerings. Our Q2 2023 operating margin of 7.9% is down 390 basis points year-over-year as we navigate uneven demand and migrate to our software-defined HPE Alletra, which includes a significant component of SaaS ratable revenue. Compute revenue was down 3% year-over-year to $2.8 billion and down 20% sequentially. The  and demand softness I discussed previously was most prevalent in the Compute business as our large customers, particularly in manufacturing and financial services in North America, digest the investments they have made in recent years. Our Compute operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our long-term outlook of 11% to 13% for the sixth consecutive quarter, which attests to the quality of our historical book of business. While we are seeing decreasing commodities costs leading to increased competitive price pressure, we are selling three differentiated platforms in the market, Gen10, Gen10+, and Gen11, which should allow a gradual management of margins over time. In HPE Services, which is within our Compute, HPC & AI and Storage segments and excluding HPE GreenLake, orders were down low single digits and revenues were flat year-over-year. HPE Financial Services revenues rose 7% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.7 billion grew 17% in constant currency, driven by HPE GreenLake. Our operating margins were down 280 basis points year-over-year, reflecting rapid interest rate hikes and higher cost of funds that we will gradually offset over time through pricing. Time and time again, this business has proven resilient in a downturn, thanks to the quality of the underlying of the book of business. Throughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our Q2 loss ratio of 50 basis points was below full-year 2019 or pre-pandemic levels. Slide 8 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. We are very pleased with the progress we are making against our edge-to-cloud strategy is evident in the financial results we have delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We have again grown both our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS in Q2 2023 year-over-year, despite our transition towards a recurring revenue model, an uneven spending environment and FX rates remaining a significant headwind that impacted revenue growth by 480 basis points in Q2 2023. Slide 9 illustrates the progress we have made in our gross margin structure. Our Q2 2023 non-GAAP gross margin is up 200 basis points year-over-year. Our growing gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of the strategic pivot of our portfolio and the pricing actions we have taken. With 56% year-over-year growth in constant currency, our Intelligent Edge business was a standout and is now representing 19% of total sales in Q2 2023, up 580 basis points from a year ago. Slide 10 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margin progress, which reached 11.5% in Q2 2023. This is up 220 basis points year-over-year, and it also represents a high watermark for non-GAAP operating profit margin for a Q2 in any year. Again, our portfolio mix shift, pricing strategies, and productivity focus are the primary drivers of our operating margin expansion. The Intelligent Edge business not only represented 19% of revenue in the quarter but did so with a record 26.9% operating margin. Turning to the next slide. As you know, we have chosen to exercise our put options on our shares in H3C. We are pleased to have announced earlier that we and our partner, Unisplendour, have come to an agreement and signed a put share purchase agreement that values our 49% stake in H3C at USD 3.5 billion. The next step in the process is to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and to complete certain conditions necessary for closing. We anticipate that the process to close will require a further 6 to 12 months to complete. However, this time line could be further extended pursuant to the terms of our agreement. We intend to update our plans for the use of proceeds once the transaction closes. You can assume that we will use the same disciplined return-based framework for evaluating investments, capital returns, and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating we have outlined in the past. As part of this framework, we may consider a range of allocation activities, including but not limited to, both organic and strategic investments, return of capital to shareholders, repayment and/or redemption of outstanding debt and general corporate purposes. We have also negotiated the terms of a new go-forward strategic sale agreement to be entered into with H3C that covers the commercial sales, service, and reseller arrangements between the companies. We're firmly committed to serving our customers and to continuing to do business in China through both direct sales and our partner, H3C. Finally, as you see on this slide, we are continuing to benefit from H3C dividends in fiscal year 2023 and we'll provide a more detailed update at SAM in October 2023 as to our go-forward expectations in this area. In Q2 2023, we are pleased to have generated a positive $889 million in cash flow from operations and $288 million in free cash flow. Our free cash flow improved by $1.6 billion sequentially from a seasonally low Q1 2023 and was also nearly $500 million above our Q2 2022 free cash flow. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of fiscal year 2023 and reiterate our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Net income was the primary driver of our positive free cash flow. Working capital continued to be a use of cash in the quarter. The timing of receipts and payments plus continuing inventory investments have lifted our cash conversion cycle to a positive 24 days in Q2 2023. We expect to exit the year with a neutral cash conversion cycle. Also, please remember we have made significant CapEx investments in HPFS volumes to drive future revenue growth in subsequent quarters. Now, let's turn to our outlook on Slide 13. As we have mentioned, demand for our products and services was more uneven in Q2 2023 across our business than it was in Q1 2023. Macro uncertainty is affecting some of our end markets, yet customer investment is rising in other end markets such as Edge and HPC & AI. We believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive market share gains in key markets. We're also entering Q3 2023 still carrying a substantial order book relative to pre-pandemic levels. Let me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure, and FX risk, which represented a 480 basis point headwind to revenue growth in Q2 2023. I would like to remind you that approximately 50% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies. We had indicated at our last earnings announcement that our financial performance in fiscal year 2023 is likely to be more weighted to the first half of the year than is typical. We continue to view that as the proper lens for fiscal year 2023. For Q3 2023, we expect revenues in the range of $6.7 billion to $7.2 billion. At the midpoint of the range, this represents revenues that are stable year-over-year and most importantly, flat sequentially in reported dollars. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.34 to $0.38 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.48. This outlook assumes the current levels of demand we have been experiencing remain relatively unchanged, that we continue to make progress on the delivery of our order book and no further deterioration from FX rates. Given the weakness in Compute demand, we are adjusting our previously communicated fiscal year 2023 guidance of 5% to 7% revenue growth to 4% to 6% in constant currency and expect FX to be a 250 basis point to 300 basis point revenue headwind. In parallel, we also expect our margin strength from portfolio mix shift to deliver non-GAAP operating profit growth of 6% to 7%, which is up from our prior 5% to 6% view. We are lifting our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from $1.40 to $1.48 to a new range of $1.42 to $1.50 and raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from $2.02 to $2.10 to a new range of $2.06 to $2.14. We reiterate our guidance for free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. For I&E, we have benefited in the first half 2023 from FX hedging costs lower than we originally forecasted. The combination of this plus other anticipated benefits in the second half of 2023 now leads us to expect to why I need to be neutral on a full year basis versus our prior expectation of a $20 million to $40 million expense. In terms of capital returns, we expect to return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. And we are maintaining our dividend and expect to repurchase at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023. So to conclude, we see the uneven end market demand in FY 2023 as an opportunity for HPE to accelerate our portfolio pivot to faster growth, higher-margin recurring revenues. Antonio and I look forward to continuing our execution momentum through fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. And Amit, if I can add to what Antonio said. I mean, this market is healthy, and it will continue to grow in the upper single digits for several years to come. We're very comfortable with this. We're also investing in adjacent TAMs. Antonio spoke about SASE, private 5G, but also data center networking, for us is a massive opportunity that we're going after. We're generating already a lot of revenues in there. Aruba today represented 19% of total revenues in Q2. If you really look at where we were at the end of fiscal year 2022, to put things in perspective, we were only at 13% of total revenues. So, we believe we now will be stably in the high teens as a percentage of revenues for the whole of the company. And then I'll let you do the math with regards to how much Aruba will represent as a percentage of total operating profit of the company.  So, Aruba is absolutely core. And you know that when we pass the 15% mark of total revenue, the stock market should take notice about that. And by way of comparison, if you compare Aruba in size to its next competitor, Juniper, it has roughly the same revenue at the end of the second quarter, but Juniper has 14% operating profit margin and Aruba is at 26.9%. That speaks volumes about the performance of Aruba."

And with that, let me turn it to you, Antonio.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our earnings call. We began our fiscal year 2023 from a position of great strength after delivering an outstanding 2022 fourth quarter. I am extremely pleased with how we leverage that strength to achieve impressive results in Q1. HPE posted a record set in first quarter performance, extending our track record of consistency fulfilling our financial commitments. We generated our highest first quarter revenue since 2016 and our best ever non-GAAP operating profit margin. Our focus on growth opportunities and pricing discipline produced our highest ever non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Powered by our market-leading hybrid cloud platform, HPE GreenLake, we unlocked an impressive $1 billion in annualized revenue run rate or ARR for the first time. Our results show the relevance of our strategy that addresses megatrends around edge, cloud and AI reshaping our industry, the transformation of our industry leading portfolio and the outstanding execution of our team. In the first quarter, total HPE revenue climbed 18% to $7.8 billion, significantly above the high end of our outlook. We once again expanded non-GAAP operating margin this time to a record 11.8%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 19% year-over-year to $0.63. Free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion, reflecting working capital needs in a quarter where we typically see use of cash. Our Q1 performance and the size of our order book position us well for fiscal year 2023. Our quarterly results, combined with confidence in our strategy and execution have led us to raise our revenue and EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. Tarek will provide more details in his remarks. From a macro perspective, the supply chain challenges we faced during several quarters continue to ease, and we expect more of that throughout fiscal year 2023. As we mentioned at the close of fiscal year 2022, we do not anticipate all supply shortages coming to an end, but we do expect supply availability to continue to improve. Our order book at the start of Q1 was larger than it was a year ago. And as we exit the quarter, it is more than twice the size of normalized historical levels. Our Intelligent Edge, HPC and AI and other as-a-service order books continue to stand at extremely elevated level. Against today's macroeconomic backdrop, demand for our solutions continue, though it is uneven across our portfolio, we also see more innovated cell cycles, specifically in compute that we have seen in recent quarters. We responded decisively to demand in the market, working to win deals across all geographies and all parts of our portfolio. The traction of our portfolio is the result of our winning strategy, aligned to major market trends around the edge, cloud and AI. We continue to anticipate what comes next for our customers and invest in innovation to address the data first modernization needs with an unmatched set of edge to cloud solutions. In addition to driving impressive organic innovation across our portfolio, we continue to be opportunistic in considering strategic acquisitions and partnerships that enhance what we can offer to our customers. Today, we announced our agreement to acquire cloud security provider access security, which will help fortify network security and strengthen our Secure Access Service Edge or SASE solutions. As we anticipate further customer demand for enhanced connectivity to our HPE Aruba Intelligent Edge solutions. Last week, we also announced our purchase of Athonet, which strengthened our private networking capabilities to help enterprises and telcos accelerate 5G deployments. Through these acquisitions, we are creating one of the most complete cloud portfolios in private 5G and wireless connectivity areas we have identified for growth in coming years. These new private 5G capabilities will be integrated into our HPE GreenLake platform, enabling customers to combine their WiFi and private 5G into one subscription that can scale according to demand. Earlier in the first quarter, we also purchased technology from two companies that enhance our cloud computing and AI offerings. Next quarter, we will begin selling scalable compute software technologies from tile scale, introducing additional choice points for customers to meet their compute and data-intensive world needs. We also integrate -- we will also integrate the packet reproducible AI software with our supercomputing AI solutions to further expand our AI at scale capabilities. We will continue to assess organic and inorganic investments that improve our competitive position in growth markets while driving higher level of recurring revenue and profitability. As always, we follow a disciplined return-based framework to build on our track record of creating sustainable long-term value for shareholders. Since we began the transformation of our business in 2019 to become the edge to cloud company, we have consistently grown our other service business, underpinned by the HPE GreenLake platform. The relevance of HPE GreenLake with customers, combined with our disciplined execution, has propelled both AI and our as-a-Service total contract value higher. Over the last two years, we have more than doubled our as-a-Service total contract value, reaching nearly $10 billion through the end of this quarter. These milestones prove the momentum in our transformation. During the first quarter, we once again increased our new HPE Green logos, growing our customer base by 7%, while as-a-Service order this quarter declined 20% year-over-year, it is important to keep in mind that the order figure is compared to prior year growth of a record 136%. One HPE GreenLake customer we recently highlighted is the 2023 Ryder Cup, which announced HPE will deliver an intelligent, secure and flexible high-performance network to our platform at the September 2023 golf event in Rome. Our platform will enable the Ryder Cup to deliver the tournament as-a-Service in a sustainable cost-efficient way while significantly enhancing the spectator experience and engagement. We have continued our investment in HP GreenLake, expanding our cloud services portfolio and partner ecosystem. In December, at our HPE Discover Frankfurt customer event in Germany, we announced our latest enhancements and the new cloud platform services capabilities in the data analytics, developer and sustainability areas. Our HPE GreenLake platform continue to attract business and drive performance across the portfolio. In every one of our key segments during the first quarter, we produced more revenues as well as positive operating profit. Let me provide you a few highlights. In our Intelligent Edge segment, revenue increased 31% year-over-year. We continue to see customers switch to our HPE Aruba technology from other vendors. We provide a single AI-driven cloud management experience, which is now part of HPE GreenLake platform with easy-of-use improving cost benefits. Year-over-year revenue growth was even higher in our HPC and AI segment, up 37% as we book revenue associated with Frontier, the world's first Exascale system. HPE is the clear market leader and has significant growth opportunities as enterprises scale AI models. AI will transform the IT landscape in the coming years and is a generation of technology shift like web, mobile and cloud that have the potential to disrupt existing business models. Supercomputing will be essential to enabling this disruption. For example, building a viable generative large language model for search would require a supercomputer to run the model continuously to stay current and improve accuracy. Our HPC and AI business has strong IP in the case of experience that give HPE a competitive advantage in building large computing systems, which are required to increase social adoption of AI models globally. We recognize AI will become the dominant supercomputing world load, while we acquired the market leader Cray in 2019. And continue to invest in key technology innovation that will enable these AI models at scale. Key examples are our acquisition of Determined AI in 2021 and Pachyderm early this year. While either unique and differentiated software to help our customer strength AI models and automate data pipelines. Customer recognized this leadership. For example, Aleph Alpha, a German startup building a commercial large language model has turned to HPE. We're also working with customers across industry verticals such as life sciences, aerospace to have new breakthroughs with AI. In the quarters ahead, we anticipate sharing more news on how we are scaling in this market and attracting new customers. I'm also pleased with the strong and steady performance of HPE Financial Services, which grew revenue 8% and financing volumes 21% year-over-year. Last month, we announced the retirement of our long-standing leader of this business, Rotman, and the promotion of Gerri Gold to take helm and further accelerate the business momentum. Gerri and her team recently launched a special financing program for customers who score high in ESG, and we are seeing great customer and partner response already. I am very proud of how the \u2013 our HPE team members have executed to achieve this quarter's exceptional plans, especially given the uneven macro environment. We have kicked off fiscal year 2023 with another set of standout results, giving us the confidence to raise our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year. Our customers have responded to the hybrid cloud value proposition we uniquely provide as they seek better ways to drive value from data from a cloud. We are attracting more customers and executing with discipline. As we look forward, we remain laser-focused on executing our winning strategy, which is delivering unmatched innovation and significant results for our customers and shareholders. We are confident in our strategy and execution for the long term. Let me now ask Tarek to give details on our business segments and greater visibility into our updated financial outlook. So, Tarek, over to you.\nTarek Robbiati: Thank you very much, Antonio. Q1 2023 was, as Antonio said, a record quarter for HPE. As usual, I will reference slides some earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q1 2023 on slide 4. Let me discuss our Q1 performance details, starting with slide 5. We are very pleased that the execution of our strategy has driven record quarterly results in terms of revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS for a first quarter of a financial year. These and other records I referenced are primarily since we reset our strategy with our 2017 spin-off transactions. Notably, revenues grew year-over-year across all our business segments, Save for corporate in Q1 2023, as we benefited from improvements in the supply environment. Our supply chain execution is solid, we have very strong momentum, thanks to our substantial order book and our investments are bearing fruit, and we are gaining share in specific at segments. In short, our strategy is working and working really well. Having said so, while we are optimistic about our fiscal year 2023, we're all realistic. Overall, we have experienced above-trend demand through much of the past two years as attested by our growing order book over the fiscal year 2022 period. And now market demand has shifted from being steady across our portfolio to being uneven over the course of Q1 2023. More specifically, deal velocity for Compute has slowed as customers digest the investments of the past two years, though demand for our storage and HPCI solutions is holding and demand for our edge solutions remains healthy. In that context, we are taking action to maintain our momentum for the second half of 2023 and fiscal year 2024. We intend to further our investments in software and services in all our business units including in our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, HPC AI, storage and edge to extend our share gains across our segments, all while retaining our cost discipline and productivity focused. We delivered Q1 revenue of $7.8 billion, which equates to a robust 12% year-over-year growth and 18% in constant currency despite our exit from Russia and Belarus in Q2 2022. We did not experience a typical seasonal decline between Q4 and Q1, thanks to excellent supply chain execution on our large order book. Each of our segments excluding only our corporate segment grew revenue at least 8% in constant currency. This revenue performance was well above our prior guidance for Q1 of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion and represented a record Q1 revenue level. We benefited from improvements in the supply environment, particularly in our Compute segment. This allowed us to execute against our order book, which our customers greatly appreciated. The delivery times of our products and services across our portfolio are now almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Yet we continue to have more progress to make in supply chain productivity as our order book entering Q2 2023 is more than twice normal level across our company. The combination of our large order book and improved supply environment gives us confidence that we can grow revenues well above the previously communicated guidance of 2% to 4% revenue growth in constant currency for fiscal year 2023. More on that later. As a result, we also a confidence in the longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2025 period, we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting last October. Our non-GAAP gross margin reached a Q1 record of 34.2%. This is up 30 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially. Our margin structure has benefited from pricing actions we have taken over the course of the pandemic, combined with the beginnings of declines in commodities and logistics costs  Over the long-term, our margin structure will continue to benefit as we continue to shift our mix of business to higher margin software-intensive as-a-Service offerings. Our non-GAAP operating margins reached a record high 11.8%. This is 80 basis points ahead of Q1 2022 and 30 basis points higher than Q4 2022. While strong revenue growth and gross margin performance are key drivers, this result would not have been possible without the strategic actions. Antonio and I took in fiscal year 2020 to reallocate resources and optimize our cost structure. As mentioned during our last earnings call, Antonio and I remain determined to maintain our focus on productivity. Our top line and margin strength in Q1 translated to GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.63. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS easily exceeded our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.58 and was another company record. Our Q1 2023 free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion. We typically have seasonal outflows in our Q1. We will discuss cash flow in more detail in a moment. But having said that, we remain on track to generate between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal year 2023. Finally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $156 million in dividend this quarter and repurchased $73 million in stock. We intend to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023, just like we did in fiscal year 2022. Turning on to our as-a-Service business performance. We are very pleased to announce our ARR surpassed $1 billion in Q1 2023. This is an important milestone for our business that reflects that our as-a-service strategy is working. The supply chain challenges have slowed our ARR growth in prior quarters. The benefits of easing supply challenges are beginning to appear in our results as ARR growth in constant currency accelerated from 25% in Q4 2022 to 31% in Q1 2023. We expect further acceleration through fiscal year 2023 as improving supply allows us to expedite delivery of as-a-service solutions to our customers. Our as-a-service order decline of 20% in Q1 is a function of a difficult compare to Q1 2022, in which orders grew 136% on strength from several large deals, including a large public cloud customer. We are comfortable with our robust pipeline of as-a-Service business. We base this confidence on our 68% order growth in fiscal year 2022, the number of deals currently pending acceptance and our current view of the sales funnel. We, therefore, retain our three-year ARR target of 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2025. Most importantly, we continue to make our as-a-Service business more valuable with a growing mix of higher-margin software and services recurring revenue. In Q1 2023, our mix of software and services increased another 150 basis points year-over-year to 65%, thanks to our cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in edge and storage. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. I would like to remind you that, all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we delivered a second consecutive record revenue quarter and surpassed the $1 billion revenue milestone for the first time. We grew our revenue 31% year-over-year. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share with our combination of wireless LAN, enterprise switching and SD-WAN solutions, including in some of the largest enterprise customers. Customers are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as our edge service platform, automation suite. Our operating margin of 21.9% was up 450 basis points annually and 860 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from scale and our prior price increases have worked through our order book. We are very, very pleased that our edge business has exceeded the rule of 40 this quarter and feel very optimistic about the prospects of our Aruba business in fiscal year 2023 and beyond, given its substantial order book underpinned by a superior platform-based SaaS offerings. We retain confidence in our long-term targets of mid-teens revenue growth and mid-20% operating margins. In HPC and AI, revenue grew 37% year-over-year. We successfully closed the balance of the Frontier deal in Q1, which contributed to the strength of this business in Q1 2023. While the segment is also now benefiting from easing supply chain, the lumpiness and long lead times of this business mean that operating margins will continue to fluctuate. As Antonio mentioned, we have been thinking strategically about and investing behind Artificial Intelligence for many years. This is true both organically and inorganically. The emergence of large language models such as ChatGPT and BART and generative AI, some of which run on our systems has prompted many questions from our customer base. We believe AI at scale is a high-growth market and then the building and refinement of AI models will require unique computational capabilities that our Cray supercomputers and HPI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable. We intend to invest organically and inorganically as listed by our acquisition of Pachyderm to fully grasp this opportunity. With regards to storage, we are pleased to report 10% annual growth, where we are bolstering our portfolio to grow market share. HPE Alletra remains one of our fastest-growing new product introductions ever, and grew well above triple-digits in Q1. HPE Alletra contributed to double-digit growth in our own IP products, which is driving a mix shift to higher-margin, software-intensive as-a-Service revenue. We continue to invest in R&D for our own IP products in this business unit. And as a result, our Q1 operating margin of 12% is down 190 basis points year-over-year. Compute revenues grew 19% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. The segment benefited from the multi-sourcing and demand steaming initiatives we have discussed in prior calls as well as steadily improving supply availability. Our dynamic pricing strategy has helped us navigate a volatile supply climate while driving industry-leading gross margins. Our Compute operating margin of 17.6% exceeded our long-term outlook of 11% to 13% for the fifth consecutive quarter, which attests to our best-in-class performance. We do believe our Compute operating margins are peaking and should gradually return to our target range of 11% to 13%. While we are seeing commodities costs decreasing, leading to increased competitive price pressure, we have for the first time three concurrent and differentiated platforms being sold in the market, Gen10, Gen10 Plus and Gen11, which would allow a gradual management of pricing and margins over time. In our Pointnext Operational Services business, combined with Storage services, orders declined mid- to high single-digits and revenues were flat year-over-year, driven by uneven demand. As you know, this is a key component of recurring revenues and profit for each of our segments. Finally, HPE Financial Services revenues rose 8% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.6 billion grew 21% in constant currency. Our operating margins fell 300 basis points year-over-year due to the higher interest rate climate that we will gradually offset over time through pricing. Time and time again, our HPFS business has proven resilience in downturn, thanks to the quality of the underwriting of the book of business. Throughout the pandemic, I'd like to remind you, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our loss ratio is back to pre-pandemic levels of approximately 50 basis points. Slide 8 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. We are very pleased that the progress we are making again our edge-to-cloud strategy is evidence in the financial results we have delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We have grown both our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to record or near-record levels in Q1 2023. This illustrates not only the commercial success of our products in the marketplace, but also our ability to generate healthy margins. I am particularly pleased to see that our focus on supply chain execution has enabled the attainment of record revenues despite a substantial year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange rates that impacted revenue growth by 550 basis points in Q1 2023. Slide 9 illustrates the progress we have made in our gross margin structure. Our Q1 2023 non-GAAP gross margin is up 30 basis points year-over-year. We generated $2.7 billion in gross profit in Q1 2023, which is yet another quarterly record. Our gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of our strategic pricing actions through the period of supply challenges in fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2022. It is also illustrative of the long-term favorable mix shift we are driving. Despite a strong compute quarter, our revenue mix of computing at 44% was flat year-over-year. This illustrates that we have a larger revenue base as our higher-margin segments are growing rapidly, and our as-a-service strategy is gaining momentum. Slide 10 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margins for which reached 11.8% in Q1 '23. This is up 30 basis points sequentially and 80 basis points year-over-year. It is also a record quarterly non-GAAP operating margin for the company. Our very strong Q1 revenue performance and our resilient gross margins are the leading contributors to the operating margin expansion. Unlike many tech companies that have announced layoffs recently, we have strong momentum at HPE with a combination of our improved cost structure, substantial order book and outstanding execution, delivering profitable growth that is increasingly recurring at higher margins as our as-a-service transformation continues to unfold. Again, let me reiterate that Antonio and I are determined to maintain this focus on profitable growth and productivity for the future. Let's now turn to discuss H3C. As you know, we've chosen to exercise our put options on our shares in H3C. We took this decision to carefully weigh the financial implications of remaining in the joint venture with the risk-reward profile of exercising the put. We are confident that we have made the decision that is in the best interest of our shareholders. HPE and our partner, Unisplendour continue to have strive discussions to reach agreement on the determination of the final purchase price of HPE shares in HPC and enter into a share purchase agreement. We will keep you updated \u2013 please keep in mind that, our decision to exercise the put is distinct from the commercial agreements with H3C. We intend to continue to do business in China through both our direct sales and through H3C and we remain committed to serving our customers in China. I would like to remind you that, we will continue to recognize the value of the dividends we received from H3C in our financials until the transaction is complete and I'm happy to report H3C results remains healthy despite uncertainty in the Chinese economy. Our first fiscal year from a cash flow perspective is typically a down quarter for cash flow. In Q1 2023, we had outflows of $800 million in cash flow from operations. And $1.3 billion in free cash flow. Working capital was a use of cash due to timing of receipts, payments, and continue investments in inventory, which has driven our cash flow conversion cycle from negative 14 days in Q4 to positive 15 days in Q1 2023. More specifically, our accounts payable balance was reduced by $2.2 billion quarter-over-quarter and was the main driver for negative operating cash flow and affected our cash flow conversion cycle. Also we have made significant investment in HPEFS volumes to drive future growth in subsequent quarters. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of fiscal year 2023 and reiterate our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. Now let's turn to our outlook slide on Slide 13. As we have mentioned, demand for our products and services was more uneven in Q1 2023 across our business than it was in Q4 2022. Having said that, we also believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive market share gains and are entering Q2 2023 with a substantial order book relative to pre-pandemic levels. We have strong momentum in Q1 2023 and we are now turning our focus to invest in sustaining that momentum in the second half of 2023 and fiscal year 2024 in a context of continuous macroeconomic uncertainty. Let me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure, or exit from Russia and Belarus in 2022 and foreign exchange risk. I would like to remind you that approximately 50% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies. For Q2 2023, we expect revenues in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion at every point of the range. This represents 9% year-over-year growth in reported dollars. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.27 to $0.35 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.52. This outlook assumes the current level of demand we have been experiencing remain unchanged. And then we continue to make progress on the delivery of our order book. To sum it up, I am very pleased with our Q1 results and guidance for Q2. We also understand some of our end markets are likely to remain uneven in the near-term. We had indicated at our last earnings announcement that our financial performance in fiscal year 2023 is likely to be more weighted \u2013 more weighted to the first half of the year than is typical. Given the strong Q1 performance, momentum and substantial order book we continue to have, we are lifting our full year guidance accordingly. We are now targeting 5% to 7% revenue growth adjusted for currency, which is at the midpoint, twice our prior revenue growth guidance, non-GAAP operating profit growth of 5% to 6%, GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.40 to $1.48. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2.02 to $2.10 and free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Specifically for OI&E, we benefited in Q1 2023 from one-off foreign exchange gains that accounted for $0.02 to $0.03 per share. These are unlikely to repeat in the rest of the fiscal year. Given the high interest rate environment is expected to remain unchanged, we expect OI&E to be an expense of $20 million to $40 million on a full year basis. This explains our fiscal year 2023 EPS guidance range of $2.02 to $2.10, which incorporates $0.06 of the $0.09 beat in Q1 2023. In terms of capital returns, we will return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. We are maintaining our dividend and expect to repurchase at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023. So to conclude, our results speak for themselves, and we continue to execute better than the competition. While many tech companies are playing defense with layoffs, we see fiscal year 2023 as an opportunity to accelerate the execution of our strategy. Antonio and I look forward to continuing our execution momentum through fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may now go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on the solid performance. I guess, I wanted to ask a question more strategically in kind of thinking about the product portfolio. You guys and many others, obviously talking a lot about ChatGPT, GTP and Generative AI. In the conversation on today's call, you alluded to the fact that you're well positioned with some of your HPC and your high-performance compute platforms. And I want to make sure I understood what you're saying a little bit correct. Are you participating in some of the infrastructure in some of the cloud opportunities, or how do you see yourself participating in kind of these AI investments that really seem to be driving this narrative around meaningful deployments of accelerated compute? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Well, thank you, Aaron. Obviously, AI is now front and center in the IT community, because of what we saw in the last couple of months. And as I said, has the potential to disrupt every industry. We cannot talk about what specific cloud, that is one specific cloud they use our specific Cray systems. But I will say, we have a bigger opportunity than that because when I think about the deployment of these large language models that require supercomputing capacity. And at that point, when you think about what we did with Frontier is how we make that accessible to every enterprise of every size. And so we, as a company, have a unique opportunity that happens every softer where there is a massive inflection point like AI and LLM, right, the large language model with a unique differentiation in our IP, which is a combination of organic assets that we built over a number of years and the acquisition of Cray. So as Tarek started sending his remarks, we are assessing what is the type of business model we can deploy as a part of our as-a-service model. By offering, what I call a cloud supercomputing IS layer with a platform-as-a-service that ultimate developers can develop, train and deploy these large models at scale. So that's why we said early on, we will talk more about that in the subsequent quarters. But we are very well positioned, and we have a very large pipeline of customers. Last week, I was in Europe, and I was amazed to see the large pipeline customers that they are demanding that. And I mentioned one specific customer, Aleph Alpha which is already coming to us to do that.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you, Anthony \u2013 thank you, Aaron. Next question, Anthony, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. You noted, obviously, seeing some weakness kind of in the environment. Just wanted to get a sense of either customer type or vertical or just kind of segment that you've got to kind of see be the source that kind of weakness throughout the year? And are you seeing more people kind of opt for GreenLake subscription offerings as a result of kind of more macro sensitivity? Thanks.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. I mean, I don't think there is one specific geography or one specific segment. I will say, as we said in the early remarks, right, the Compute business, obviously, we see a little bit more unevenness, if you will, with longer sales cycles because also they are digested all what they acquired last year, because of the supply chain and the cost rising. But when you look at the rest of the segments, as Tarek said and I said, the Intelligent Edge business, the Connectivity business, is very, very solid. And we exited once again in Q1 with an extremely elevated book of orders. HPC, we just talked about it, right? We see an amazing pipeline in front of us. We have only deployed one exascale system, and we have few to go because we are delivering all of them to the Department of Energy. And then as I said earlier, right, we have an opportunity to grow that business through an as-a-Service model. But that said, what customers are telling me is that they need a hybrid cloud experience. And we see, in some cases, repatriation of workloads on-prem, but they want the same cloud experience with the same consumption model, and that's what GreenLake does extremely well. It's a true hybrid cloud experience for low-dose overloads, where data, data compliance and cost plays a big role, and that's why we see the momentum we have. The fact that we doubled the total contract value from Q1 2021 to Q1 2023 from $5 billion to $10 billion, it tells you the momentum. What I'm really pleased is the fact that two-third of that momentum is in software and services, which means we will be more resilient as we go forward to weather some of these challenges because it's a recurring revenue. And we count in that, just to be clear, through Software-as-a-Service subscription and consumption, which is exactly the way it's supposed to be. And that's why we are very bullish about our GreenLake and the fact that we crossed $1 billion ARR, it's just a testament that we have a winning strategy.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you, Meta. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may now go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the execution here. I guess my question was more on the full year guide, and I understand some of the headwinds in certain segments that you're calling out, but the revenue guide goes up by about sort of 300 basis points for the year. The operating profit growth sort of goes up by 100 basis points. And while I understand some of the headwinds, what maybe I can use some help on is really understand the mix implications of how you're thinking about it, just given the more lower sort of flow-through that we're seeing to operating profit growth for the full year guide? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Sure. So thank you for remarking that our revenue guide at the midpoint is effectively doubling from the prior guide that we gave. The prior guide that we gave was 2% to 4%. We're now guiding 5% to 7%. So at the midpoint, it is 6%, which is double what we gave previously. And in giving that guide, we factor in a number of elements. First of all, the macro environment, second of all foreign exchange rates; and third of all, our desire to continue to invest to perpetrate the momentum that we have in the second half and in fiscal year 2024 because there's always something else that we have to think about for the end of the year, and we're not done yet. I also want to flag that we believe that commodity costs are coming down in particular areas, which should effectively come with added pricing pressure in compute, and this is also something that we have factored into our guidance. But if you really think about our non-GAAP operating profit growth. The prior guide was at 4% to 5% growth, and now we're guiding 5% to 6% growth, and we feel comfortable with the information we have on the macro, foreign exchange cetera, that our guide is appropriate.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you, Samik. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. You may now go ahead.\nKyle McNealy: Great. Thanks for the question. It was a great quarter for Intelligent Edge. Can you help us understand how we should think about a big quarter here in Q1? Is that level sustainable going forward, or was there some big deals or particular activity that you would call out that isn't likely to repeat. Your guidance implies it decelerates from here, but -- can you give us a sense for how we should model this going forward and how frequently you might see growth ahead of your mid-teens growth guidance? Thanks.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Kyle. No, there was not a unique deal. This is the continuous momentum we have had now for a number of quarters. The book of business in this particular business segment continue to be extremely renovated. As Tarek said, we continue to gain share. And I think it's because we have a unique value proposition, which is a cloud native offer for all aspects of connectivity. We announced now the acquisition of Athonet, which we will integrate the private 5G into the same control plane. And today, we announced the acquisition of Access Security, which is the secure access secure edge at the top. And so when we think about the book of business, the incredible pipeline we have ahead of us, the execution of the team, the easing of the supply, although in this particular business, there is a little bit more constrained on the supply compared to the other businesses. We talk about a Rule of 40, and this was the Rule of 50 something, I guess. But the fact of the matter is that, as Tarek said, we expect to grow double-digits, right? And in the mid-20s on operating profit. This business is now humming and it's going to be one of the most important growth engine as we go in the future. And as Tarek said, it's also allowing us to be less reliant on the rest of the portfolio, which is very, very critical. And this comes with a high gross margin, obviously.\nTarek Robbiati: I would simply add to what Antonio said, look, the edge have broken the $1 billion revenue bar. I think now we are entering a phase with all the additions that we're making to the portfolio. We're entering a phase of a new watermark level. We have built at the edge with Antonio and the management team, one of the most comprehensive portfolio of the entire industry. And it is really, really winning shares even in the largest customer segments, thanks to the Edge-to-Cloud platform that Aruba has built and that powers GreenLake in everything we do.\nAntonio Neri: And I hope the market will take notice of that and give us a little bit of recognition about the work we have done in this particular segment.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you, Kyle. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may now go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I know this is going to be a bit of a tricky one, but I want to see if you could help us understand why your view sound more optimistic than your other IT-exposed peers, whether it's around, in particular, the Compute side of the business as a storage. I get Intelligent Edge, so I'm not really pushing there. But just the contrast in your outlook on storage and compute versus some of your peers. Can you help us understand that?\nAntonio Neri: Sure. Thank you, Simon. Well, first of all, let me start by saying, we have a unique strategy and a very diversified portfolio. Some of our competitors don't have the breadth and depth of our portfolio. Some of them are just playing compute and storage, some of them play just in storage, some of them only play in networking. And by the way, let's remind ourselves that one-third of our recurring revenues come from services, which is unique in our space. So we have a unique portfolio, which is incredibly relevant in the mega trends we see in the market. But we have done really well, I will say, Simon, is we brought all that unique portfolio in an integrated solution and experience through HPE GreenLake. And now the HPE GreenLake is a winning strategy for us, because it's very hard to do. One thing is to offer just a subscription model on some sort of solution. But when you leverage a true as-a-service model across all line of businesses, let me remind you, architecturally, I drove a vision with the team that everything we do, whether you consume it as a service or you consume it in a traditional way, that entire experience is delivered now to HPE GreenLake. Whether you deploy a compute node somewhere, whether in the cloud or premise or at the edge, you need a subscription to that compute node. Whether it's the storage business. Now you asked about the storage. This product, HPE Alletra and Tarek mentioned this, is the fastest product in the history of the company, has grown triple digits on a consistent basis. And you will see more announcement about this platform going forward, but it was conceived to be a SaaS-led offer. And so that's why it's fueling also the recurrent revenue as we go forward. And I think the combination of that gives the customers a unique experience instead of buying three different things for people, they can consume it all through one integrated experience. And that's why we are confident. Now on the compute side, obviously, that compute business go through their own processes and cycles, right, because we have CPUs that come on and off at different time of the year or years. But Tarek said, we have three concurrent platforms going on that gives us a lot of flexibility to attack specific customer segments with different configure and pricing. And generation 11 is unique because we address three specific needs, the hybrid cloud need, the security they need and the workload optimization. And it comes with unique technologies that actually lift the UP, because now it's more structural, because we're adding DDR5 memory, which basically means more content into the server. And that's why we believe we can manage through this transition. But, I mean, if you look at the performance of that business, it was best in class, 90% year-over-year growth and an amazing 17.6% operating profit. And when you look at some of our competitors, as a combined business, not even come to the same number we delivered just on compute.\nJeff Kvaal: Simon, thanks very much. Let\u2019s move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may now go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. I was wondering if you could just talk about what's the timing for the H3C transaction from here? And then how do you think about the usage of the proceeds that you get from here? Because, I think, if you sell the stake you have, it would be dilutive by about $0.17 to $0.18 of EPS line. So I'm just wondering, how do you think about using the proceeds and offsetting the dilution potentially? Thank you.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes. So thank you, Amit, for the question on H3C. We exercised the put, as you recall, towards the end of the calendar year of 2022. And we are right now in the process of agreeing the value of our stake with our partners of Unigroup. And this process is going to take a few month and it's going to -- we expect it to complete towards the end of calendar year 2023, and we feel reasonably good about the prospects. For the meantime, we continue to consolidate H3C and benefit from the dividends that we received from the company. And we are not deconsolidating H3C at this stage. It's most likely going to be the case of the end of fiscal year 2023 when that will happen. And at that point, we will advise both on the impact of dilution from deconsolidation and also the use of proceeds once we receive them. I would like to also emphasize that we continue to have commercial agreements with H3C, notwithstanding, the exercise of the put, those commercial agreements are distinct from the exercise of the put, and we will continue to generate value through those commercial agreements that we have with H3C.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah. And as always, I mean, listen, we're going to apply the same discipline for returning capital to shareholders and continue to invest in the business at the appropriate time. But until we finish this process, right, it's just emphasizing. We have to go through the process and complete the agreement.\nJeff Kvaal: Amit, thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. You may now go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong results. So I also have a question on the full year guide being up 3% to 6% -- I think it's 5% to 7%. And, obviously, impressive compared to our peer, who just downtake earlier today. But if I look at the midpoint, take a midpoint of your fiscal second quarter guidance, it would assume the second half of the year will be down slightly from the first half, which is kind of unseasonal, right? It's normal seasonality is up, call it, 5%. Can you talk about what's embedded in your second half revenue guidance? Is that all driven by your view on the macro side, any one-time item that we should be thinking about in the first half? And maybe how we should think about the backlog helping -- delivering from your backlog offset some of the demand weakness from half-over-half basis at the standpoint? Thanks.\nTarek Robbiati: Okay. A lot of questions into one question, but I will try my best. So first and foremost, the revenue growth that we are targeting for the full year is 5% to 7%, which at the midpoint is 6%, which is double what we originally anticipated. And that is because of all the puts and takes in our portfolio and the way we see supply easing on one side, also demand continuing unevenly although across our portfolio. And if you really look at our EPS guide, one thing I would like to emphasize for everyone on the call is that we did beat the midpoint of our guide by $0.09 and $0.03 of that beat pertained to OI&E and had to do with foreign exchange gains that are not operational. We continue to view OI&E on the full year basis being an expense of US$20 million to US$40 million due to elevated interest expenses. And there is also in our guidance, the potential impact from FX volatility. And so what is baked into our guidance is just that our current view to the best of our knowledge, of the macro environment, the impact of interest rates and also the impact of foreign exchange rates that we see at this stage, knowing that things can evolve. It's also important to note that this is our first quarter. We still have nine months to go, and we want to make sure that we remain prudent in the current circumstance where the macro environment remains uncertain.\nJeff Kvaal: Sidney, thanks very much, and we'll take two more questions, Anthony?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about how much incremental order's in your backlog you were able to satisfy versus what you had anticipated going into the quarter given the fact that some of these supply chain improvements came through the course of the quarter? And can you also maybe help us think through what you're expecting from an FX headwind now in fiscal 2023 relative to your SAM guide of a $0.30 headwind to EPS. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Thanks, Wamsi. I will answer the first part and Tarek, on the second part. I mean not enough. I mean, the fact of the matter is that we made some progress, but not enough progress against that very strong order book. And that's why we exit Q1 with 2x normal historical levels. Now, we expect that to continue to improve, obviously, throughout the years as supply continue to ease. But again, we have a good pipeline in front of us. And so the goal is to continue to fill the order book. But when you ask me about how much progress we made in Q1, not enough. If you look at our Intelligent Edge business is extremely elevated. Our HPC business, when I look about the future deliveries we have to live is always very, very strong. Storage is good, and Compute is still there. So we have work to do, more work to do. And then on FX, I think -- \nTarek Robbiati: Oh, yes. Thank you, Antonio, and thank you, Wamsi. This gives me the opportunity to remind everybody that at SAM in last October, we flagged at least a $0.30 headwind from foreign exchange this fiscal year. Quite honestly, the headwind we have experienced in this quarter of 550 basis points is above what we anticipated. We still feel that we can attain our new guide on revenue growth and EPS, notwithstanding the current FX headwinds and but things can always evolve and this is why we remain prudent in our full year guide, with regards to revenue and EPS growth. So that 30-plus percent EPS impact from FX has risen, but we are managing it and factoring it into our new guide.\nAntonio Neri: I mean, on that point, I think it's simply remarkable because we have to cover all of that $0.30 started right operationally.\nTarek Robbiati: Yes.\nAntonio Neri: The fact that, we are raising the midpoint from the $2, which included a $0.30 headwind now $2.06. It shows you that the mix of the business is going in the right direction, the expansion of the margins and the productivity we continue to drive. Despite the fact the FX actually got worse at the time. And the 550 basis point is pretty significant. So I think from our vantage point, we are doing all the right things and we're confident in that guidance we just provided to you.\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks very much, Wamsi. And Anthony, last question, please.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. You may now go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Really appreciate it. Antonio, I would love to get any context you can provide going back to the AI and large language model conversation. Is there any useful way for us to think about the required resources sort of difference and what you're seeing for those applications relative to kind of typical high-performance Compute application resources? And then are you also seeing for those AI type projects. Are you also seeing any impact to the storage attach? And then is there any networking attach impact there as well? Would just love context on those rates. Thanks a lot.\nAntonio Neri: No, thank you. Well, we have been in the AI business now for many years, right? So -- and we have been in the specific AI a scale business. One of the key differentiations we have in that business, actually several, right? Number one is the -- what you refer to as networking, I call it interconnect fabric. The ability to connect 40,000 GPUs at scale requires a unique differentiated fabric. That's what the Frontier system is all about. And as I think about the next generation of this, we can easily double to 80,000 GPUs because our software and our silicon scales to those levels. And so that's a unique value proposition that you don't get in the traditional commoditized cloud environment. The other key differentiation we have is the programming environment we acquired to the Cray acquisition because when you develop these AI models, you have to deploy and you have to manage it at scale to take advantage of the massive set of capabilities. That also is a unique software value proposition that's very hard to duplicate. And then last but not least, to be able to leverage all these wonderful capabilities, you have to be able to prepare the data. And the data pipeline requires a lot of work upfront because it has to be clean and compliance and all of that. And that's why our acquisitions like Determined AI and Pachyderm in particular, now allows us to automate that data pipeline. But we are not stopping there. We continue to move up and build what I call the platform as a service for developers, so they can take advantage of this automation for the data, train the models and then deploy the model. And if they need a supercomputing type of capabilities, we will be there for them. So that's why I said early on, we are a unique point in time, where an inflection in the market intersects a unique set of capabilities, which we intend to fully capitalize top to bottom. Not just on the hardware level, but all the way to the software level. And you will hear more about that as we come to the next months and quarters. And I'm really excited about that opportunity because we already have customers coming to us we need that, and they are generally enterprise customers that deploy these large case model that they don't want to spend hundreds of millions of dollars, but they want to use it as-a-Service. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. I always appreciate, you making the time to talk to us. I know today was an incredible busy day about all the earnings being posted. But let me remind you a couple of things. I mean, first of all, today, results is not a coincidence. It's a combination of many things we have done over a longer period of time. It is the fact that we have a unique strategy, we have been consistently executing with discipline at all levels, driving cost discipline, productivity, investing organically, and inorganically to bolster our unique portfolio aligned to those trends we discussed today. We generated a record performance in the first quarter for our shareholders. It was the highest revenue quarter since 2016. We delivered the best non-GAAP operating profit and the highest ever EPS net diluted earnings per share. And I believe we are very well-positioned to navigate this uneven market. As always, there is always more work to do, no question about that. But I think we have a world-class team; a unique culture and customers want us to be there for them through this tradition. So, thank you very much, and all forward to see you at the next call or in one of the conference calls we do with you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our earnings call. We began our fiscal year 2023 from a position of great strength after delivering an outstanding 2022 fourth quarter. I am extremely pleased with how we leverage that strength to achieve impressive results in Q1. HPE posted a record set in first quarter performance, extending our track record of consistency fulfilling our financial commitments. We generated our highest first quarter revenue since 2016 and our best ever non-GAAP operating profit margin. Our focus on growth opportunities and pricing discipline produced our highest ever non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Powered by our market-leading hybrid cloud platform, HPE GreenLake, we unlocked an impressive $1 billion in annualized revenue run rate or ARR for the first time. Our results show the relevance of our strategy that addresses megatrends around edge, cloud and AI reshaping our industry, the transformation of our industry leading portfolio and the outstanding execution of our team. In the first quarter, total HPE revenue climbed 18% to $7.8 billion, significantly above the high end of our outlook. We once again expanded non-GAAP operating margin this time to a record 11.8%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 19% year-over-year to $0.63. Free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion, reflecting working capital needs in a quarter where we typically see use of cash. Our Q1 performance and the size of our order book position us well for fiscal year 2023. Our quarterly results, combined with confidence in our strategy and execution have led us to raise our revenue and EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. Tarek will provide more details in his remarks. From a macro perspective, the supply chain challenges we faced during several quarters continue to ease, and we expect more of that throughout fiscal year 2023. As we mentioned at the close of fiscal year 2022, we do not anticipate all supply shortages coming to an end, but we do expect supply availability to continue to improve. Our order book at the start of Q1 was larger than it was a year ago. And as we exit the quarter, it is more than twice the size of normalized historical levels. Our Intelligent Edge, HPC and AI and other as-a-service order books continue to stand at extremely elevated level. Against today's macroeconomic backdrop, demand for our solutions continue, though it is uneven across our portfolio, we also see more innovated cell cycles, specifically in compute that we have seen in recent quarters. We responded decisively to demand in the market, working to win deals across all geographies and all parts of our portfolio. The traction of our portfolio is the result of our winning strategy, aligned to major market trends around the edge, cloud and AI. We continue to anticipate what comes next for our customers and invest in innovation to address the data first modernization needs with an unmatched set of edge to cloud solutions. In addition to driving impressive organic innovation across our portfolio, we continue to be opportunistic in considering strategic acquisitions and partnerships that enhance what we can offer to our customers. Today, we announced our agreement to acquire cloud security provider access security, which will help fortify network security and strengthen our Secure Access Service Edge or SASE solutions. As we anticipate further customer demand for enhanced connectivity to our HPE Aruba Intelligent Edge solutions. Last week, we also announced our purchase of Athonet, which strengthened our private networking capabilities to help enterprises and telcos accelerate 5G deployments. Through these acquisitions, we are creating one of the most complete cloud portfolios in private 5G and wireless connectivity areas we have identified for growth in coming years. These new private 5G capabilities will be integrated into our HPE GreenLake platform, enabling customers to combine their WiFi and private 5G into one subscription that can scale according to demand. Earlier in the first quarter, we also purchased technology from two companies that enhance our cloud computing and AI offerings. Next quarter, we will begin selling scalable compute software technologies from tile scale, introducing additional choice points for customers to meet their compute and data-intensive world needs. We also integrate -- we will also integrate the packet reproducible AI software with our supercomputing AI solutions to further expand our AI at scale capabilities. We will continue to assess organic and inorganic investments that improve our competitive position in growth markets while driving higher level of recurring revenue and profitability. As always, we follow a disciplined return-based framework to build on our track record of creating sustainable long-term value for shareholders. Since we began the transformation of our business in 2019 to become the edge to cloud company, we have consistently grown our other service business, underpinned by the HPE GreenLake platform. The relevance of HPE GreenLake with customers, combined with our disciplined execution, has propelled both AI and our as-a-Service total contract value higher. Over the last two years, we have more than doubled our as-a-Service total contract value, reaching nearly $10 billion through the end of this quarter. These milestones prove the momentum in our transformation. During the first quarter, we once again increased our new HPE Green logos, growing our customer base by 7%, while as-a-Service order this quarter declined 20% year-over-year, it is important to keep in mind that the order figure is compared to prior year growth of a record 136%. One HPE GreenLake customer we recently highlighted is the 2023 Ryder Cup, which announced HPE will deliver an intelligent, secure and flexible high-performance network to our platform at the September 2023 golf event in Rome. Our platform will enable the Ryder Cup to deliver the tournament as-a-Service in a sustainable cost-efficient way while significantly enhancing the spectator experience and engagement. We have continued our investment in HP GreenLake, expanding our cloud services portfolio and partner ecosystem. In December, at our HPE Discover Frankfurt customer event in Germany, we announced our latest enhancements and the new cloud platform services capabilities in the data analytics, developer and sustainability areas. Our HPE GreenLake platform continue to attract business and drive performance across the portfolio. In every one of our key segments during the first quarter, we produced more revenues as well as positive operating profit. Let me provide you a few highlights. In our Intelligent Edge segment, revenue increased 31% year-over-year. We continue to see customers switch to our HPE Aruba technology from other vendors. We provide a single AI-driven cloud management experience, which is now part of HPE GreenLake platform with easy-of-use improving cost benefits. Year-over-year revenue growth was even higher in our HPC and AI segment, up 37% as we book revenue associated with Frontier, the world's first Exascale system. HPE is the clear market leader and has significant growth opportunities as enterprises scale AI models. AI will transform the IT landscape in the coming years and is a generation of technology shift like web, mobile and cloud that have the potential to disrupt existing business models. Supercomputing will be essential to enabling this disruption. For example, building a viable generative large language model for search would require a supercomputer to run the model continuously to stay current and improve accuracy. Our HPC and AI business has strong IP in the case of experience that give HPE a competitive advantage in building large computing systems, which are required to increase social adoption of AI models globally. We recognize AI will become the dominant supercomputing world load, while we acquired the market leader Cray in 2019. And continue to invest in key technology innovation that will enable these AI models at scale. Key examples are our acquisition of Determined AI in 2021 and Pachyderm early this year. While either unique and differentiated software to help our customer strength AI models and automate data pipelines. Customer recognized this leadership. For example, Aleph Alpha, a German startup building a commercial large language model has turned to HPE. We're also working with customers across industry verticals such as life sciences, aerospace to have new breakthroughs with AI. In the quarters ahead, we anticipate sharing more news on how we are scaling in this market and attracting new customers. I'm also pleased with the strong and steady performance of HPE Financial Services, which grew revenue 8% and financing volumes 21% year-over-year. Last month, we announced the retirement of our long-standing leader of this business, Rotman, and the promotion of Gerri Gold to take helm and further accelerate the business momentum. Gerri and her team recently launched a special financing program for customers who score high in ESG, and we are seeing great customer and partner response already. I am very proud of how the \u2013 our HPE team members have executed to achieve this quarter's exceptional plans, especially given the uneven macro environment. We have kicked off fiscal year 2023 with another set of standout results, giving us the confidence to raise our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year. Our customers have responded to the hybrid cloud value proposition we uniquely provide as they seek better ways to drive value from data from a cloud. We are attracting more customers and executing with discipline. As we look forward, we remain laser-focused on executing our winning strategy, which is delivering unmatched innovation and significant results for our customers and shareholders. We are confident in our strategy and execution for the long term. Let me now ask Tarek to give details on our business segments and greater visibility into our updated financial outlook. So, Tarek, over to you. Well, thank you, Aaron. Obviously, AI is now front and center in the IT community, because of what we saw in the last couple of months. And as I said, has the potential to disrupt every industry. We cannot talk about what specific cloud, that is one specific cloud they use our specific Cray systems. But I will say, we have a bigger opportunity than that because when I think about the deployment of these large language models that require supercomputing capacity. And at that point, when you think about what we did with Frontier is how we make that accessible to every enterprise of every size. And so we, as a company, have a unique opportunity that happens every softer where there is a massive inflection point like AI and LLM, right, the large language model with a unique differentiation in our IP, which is a combination of organic assets that we built over a number of years and the acquisition of Cray. So as Tarek started sending his remarks, we are assessing what is the type of business model we can deploy as a part of our as-a-service model. By offering, what I call a cloud supercomputing IS layer with a platform-as-a-service that ultimate developers can develop, train and deploy these large models at scale. So that's why we said early on, we will talk more about that in the subsequent quarters. But we are very well positioned, and we have a very large pipeline of customers. Last week, I was in Europe, and I was amazed to see the large pipeline customers that they are demanding that. And I mentioned one specific customer, Aleph Alpha which is already coming to us to do that. Sure. I mean, I don't think there is one specific geography or one specific segment. I will say, as we said in the early remarks, right, the Compute business, obviously, we see a little bit more unevenness, if you will, with longer sales cycles because also they are digested all what they acquired last year, because of the supply chain and the cost rising. But when you look at the rest of the segments, as Tarek said and I said, the Intelligent Edge business, the Connectivity business, is very, very solid. And we exited once again in Q1 with an extremely elevated book of orders. HPC, we just talked about it, right? We see an amazing pipeline in front of us. We have only deployed one exascale system, and we have few to go because we are delivering all of them to the Department of Energy. And then as I said earlier, right, we have an opportunity to grow that business through an as-a-Service model. But that said, what customers are telling me is that they need a hybrid cloud experience. And we see, in some cases, repatriation of workloads on-prem, but they want the same cloud experience with the same consumption model, and that's what GreenLake does extremely well. It's a true hybrid cloud experience for low-dose overloads, where data, data compliance and cost plays a big role, and that's why we see the momentum we have. The fact that we doubled the total contract value from Q1 2021 to Q1 2023 from $5 billion to $10 billion, it tells you the momentum. What I'm really pleased is the fact that two-third of that momentum is in software and services, which means we will be more resilient as we go forward to weather some of these challenges because it's a recurring revenue. And we count in that, just to be clear, through Software-as-a-Service subscription and consumption, which is exactly the way it's supposed to be. And that's why we are very bullish about our GreenLake and the fact that we crossed $1 billion ARR, it's just a testament that we have a winning strategy. Yes. Thanks, Kyle. No, there was not a unique deal. This is the continuous momentum we have had now for a number of quarters. The book of business in this particular business segment continue to be extremely renovated. As Tarek said, we continue to gain share. And I think it's because we have a unique value proposition, which is a cloud native offer for all aspects of connectivity. We announced now the acquisition of Athonet, which we will integrate the private 5G into the same control plane. And today, we announced the acquisition of Access Security, which is the secure access secure edge at the top. And so when we think about the book of business, the incredible pipeline we have ahead of us, the execution of the team, the easing of the supply, although in this particular business, there is a little bit more constrained on the supply compared to the other businesses. We talk about a Rule of 40, and this was the Rule of 50 something, I guess. But the fact of the matter is that, as Tarek said, we expect to grow double-digits, right? And in the mid-20s on operating profit. This business is now humming and it's going to be one of the most important growth engine as we go in the future. And as Tarek said, it's also allowing us to be less reliant on the rest of the portfolio, which is very, very critical. And this comes with a high gross margin, obviously. And I hope the market will take notice of that and give us a little bit of recognition about the work we have done in this particular segment. Sure. Thank you, Simon. Well, first of all, let me start by saying, we have a unique strategy and a very diversified portfolio. Some of our competitors don't have the breadth and depth of our portfolio. Some of them are just playing compute and storage, some of them play just in storage, some of them only play in networking. And by the way, let's remind ourselves that one-third of our recurring revenues come from services, which is unique in our space. So we have a unique portfolio, which is incredibly relevant in the mega trends we see in the market. But we have done really well, I will say, Simon, is we brought all that unique portfolio in an integrated solution and experience through HPE GreenLake. And now the HPE GreenLake is a winning strategy for us, because it's very hard to do. One thing is to offer just a subscription model on some sort of solution. But when you leverage a true as-a-service model across all line of businesses, let me remind you, architecturally, I drove a vision with the team that everything we do, whether you consume it as a service or you consume it in a traditional way, that entire experience is delivered now to HPE GreenLake. Whether you deploy a compute node somewhere, whether in the cloud or premise or at the edge, you need a subscription to that compute node. Whether it's the storage business. Now you asked about the storage. This product, HPE Alletra and Tarek mentioned this, is the fastest product in the history of the company, has grown triple digits on a consistent basis. And you will see more announcement about this platform going forward, but it was conceived to be a SaaS-led offer. And so that's why it's fueling also the recurrent revenue as we go forward. And I think the combination of that gives the customers a unique experience instead of buying three different things for people, they can consume it all through one integrated experience. And that's why we are confident. Now on the compute side, obviously, that compute business go through their own processes and cycles, right, because we have CPUs that come on and off at different time of the year or years. But Tarek said, we have three concurrent platforms going on that gives us a lot of flexibility to attack specific customer segments with different configure and pricing. And generation 11 is unique because we address three specific needs, the hybrid cloud need, the security they need and the workload optimization. And it comes with unique technologies that actually lift the UP, because now it's more structural, because we're adding DDR5 memory, which basically means more content into the server. And that's why we believe we can manage through this transition. But, I mean, if you look at the performance of that business, it was best in class, 90% year-over-year growth and an amazing 17.6% operating profit. And when you look at some of our competitors, as a combined business, not even come to the same number we delivered just on compute. Yeah. And as always, I mean, listen, we're going to apply the same discipline for returning capital to shareholders and continue to invest in the business at the appropriate time. But until we finish this process, right, it's just emphasizing. We have to go through the process and complete the agreement. Thanks, Wamsi. I will answer the first part and Tarek, on the second part. I mean not enough. I mean, the fact of the matter is that we made some progress, but not enough progress against that very strong order book. And that's why we exit Q1 with 2x normal historical levels. Now, we expect that to continue to improve, obviously, throughout the years as supply continue to ease. But again, we have a good pipeline in front of us. And so the goal is to continue to fill the order book. But when you ask me about how much progress we made in Q1, not enough. If you look at our Intelligent Edge business is extremely elevated. Our HPC business, when I look about the future deliveries we have to live is always very, very strong. Storage is good, and Compute is still there. So we have work to do, more work to do. And then on FX, I think -- I mean, on that point, I think it's simply remarkable because we have to cover all of that $0.30 started right operationally. The fact that, we are raising the midpoint from the $2, which included a $0.30 headwind now $2.06. It shows you that the mix of the business is going in the right direction, the expansion of the margins and the productivity we continue to drive. Despite the fact the FX actually got worse at the time. And the 550 basis point is pretty significant. So I think from our vantage point, we are doing all the right things and we're confident in that guidance we just provided to you. No, thank you. Well, we have been in the AI business now for many years, right? So -- and we have been in the specific AI a scale business. One of the key differentiations we have in that business, actually several, right? Number one is the -- what you refer to as networking, I call it interconnect fabric. The ability to connect 40,000 GPUs at scale requires a unique differentiated fabric. That's what the Frontier system is all about. And as I think about the next generation of this, we can easily double to 80,000 GPUs because our software and our silicon scales to those levels. And so that's a unique value proposition that you don't get in the traditional commoditized cloud environment. The other key differentiation we have is the programming environment we acquired to the Cray acquisition because when you develop these AI models, you have to deploy and you have to manage it at scale to take advantage of the massive set of capabilities. That also is a unique software value proposition that's very hard to duplicate. And then last but not least, to be able to leverage all these wonderful capabilities, you have to be able to prepare the data. And the data pipeline requires a lot of work upfront because it has to be clean and compliance and all of that. And that's why our acquisitions like Determined AI and Pachyderm in particular, now allows us to automate that data pipeline. But we are not stopping there. We continue to move up and build what I call the platform as a service for developers, so they can take advantage of this automation for the data, train the models and then deploy the model. And if they need a supercomputing type of capabilities, we will be there for them. So that's why I said early on, we are a unique point in time, where an inflection in the market intersects a unique set of capabilities, which we intend to fully capitalize top to bottom. Not just on the hardware level, but all the way to the software level. And you will hear more about that as we come to the next months and quarters. And I'm really excited about that opportunity because we already have customers coming to us we need that, and they are generally enterprise customers that deploy these large case model that they don't want to spend hundreds of millions of dollars, but they want to use it as-a-Service. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. I always appreciate, you making the time to talk to us. I know today was an incredible busy day about all the earnings being posted. But let me remind you a couple of things. I mean, first of all, today, results is not a coincidence. It's a combination of many things we have done over a longer period of time. It is the fact that we have a unique strategy, we have been consistently executing with discipline at all levels, driving cost discipline, productivity, investing organically, and inorganically to bolster our unique portfolio aligned to those trends we discussed today. We generated a record performance in the first quarter for our shareholders. It was the highest revenue quarter since 2016. We delivered the best non-GAAP operating profit and the highest ever EPS net diluted earnings per share. And I believe we are very well-positioned to navigate this uneven market. As always, there is always more work to do, no question about that. But I think we have a world-class team; a unique culture and customers want us to be there for them through this tradition. So, thank you very much, and all forward to see you at the next call or in one of the conference calls we do with you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tarek Robbiati",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Antonio. Q1 2023 was, as Antonio said, a record quarter for HPE. As usual, I will reference slides some earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q1 2023 on slide 4. Let me discuss our Q1 performance details, starting with slide 5. We are very pleased that the execution of our strategy has driven record quarterly results in terms of revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS for a first quarter of a financial year. These and other records I referenced are primarily since we reset our strategy with our 2017 spin-off transactions. Notably, revenues grew year-over-year across all our business segments, Save for corporate in Q1 2023, as we benefited from improvements in the supply environment. Our supply chain execution is solid, we have very strong momentum, thanks to our substantial order book and our investments are bearing fruit, and we are gaining share in specific at segments. In short, our strategy is working and working really well. Having said so, while we are optimistic about our fiscal year 2023, we're all realistic. Overall, we have experienced above-trend demand through much of the past two years as attested by our growing order book over the fiscal year 2022 period. And now market demand has shifted from being steady across our portfolio to being uneven over the course of Q1 2023. More specifically, deal velocity for Compute has slowed as customers digest the investments of the past two years, though demand for our storage and HPCI solutions is holding and demand for our edge solutions remains healthy. In that context, we are taking action to maintain our momentum for the second half of 2023 and fiscal year 2024. We intend to further our investments in software and services in all our business units including in our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, HPC AI, storage and edge to extend our share gains across our segments, all while retaining our cost discipline and productivity focused. We delivered Q1 revenue of $7.8 billion, which equates to a robust 12% year-over-year growth and 18% in constant currency despite our exit from Russia and Belarus in Q2 2022. We did not experience a typical seasonal decline between Q4 and Q1, thanks to excellent supply chain execution on our large order book. Each of our segments excluding only our corporate segment grew revenue at least 8% in constant currency. This revenue performance was well above our prior guidance for Q1 of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion and represented a record Q1 revenue level. We benefited from improvements in the supply environment, particularly in our Compute segment. This allowed us to execute against our order book, which our customers greatly appreciated. The delivery times of our products and services across our portfolio are now almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Yet we continue to have more progress to make in supply chain productivity as our order book entering Q2 2023 is more than twice normal level across our company. The combination of our large order book and improved supply environment gives us confidence that we can grow revenues well above the previously communicated guidance of 2% to 4% revenue growth in constant currency for fiscal year 2023. More on that later. As a result, we also a confidence in the longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2025 period, we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting last October. Our non-GAAP gross margin reached a Q1 record of 34.2%. This is up 30 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially. Our margin structure has benefited from pricing actions we have taken over the course of the pandemic, combined with the beginnings of declines in commodities and logistics costs  Over the long-term, our margin structure will continue to benefit as we continue to shift our mix of business to higher margin software-intensive as-a-Service offerings. Our non-GAAP operating margins reached a record high 11.8%. This is 80 basis points ahead of Q1 2022 and 30 basis points higher than Q4 2022. While strong revenue growth and gross margin performance are key drivers, this result would not have been possible without the strategic actions. Antonio and I took in fiscal year 2020 to reallocate resources and optimize our cost structure. As mentioned during our last earnings call, Antonio and I remain determined to maintain our focus on productivity. Our top line and margin strength in Q1 translated to GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.63. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS easily exceeded our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.58 and was another company record. Our Q1 2023 free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion. We typically have seasonal outflows in our Q1. We will discuss cash flow in more detail in a moment. But having said that, we remain on track to generate between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal year 2023. Finally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $156 million in dividend this quarter and repurchased $73 million in stock. We intend to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023, just like we did in fiscal year 2022. Turning on to our as-a-Service business performance. We are very pleased to announce our ARR surpassed $1 billion in Q1 2023. This is an important milestone for our business that reflects that our as-a-service strategy is working. The supply chain challenges have slowed our ARR growth in prior quarters. The benefits of easing supply challenges are beginning to appear in our results as ARR growth in constant currency accelerated from 25% in Q4 2022 to 31% in Q1 2023. We expect further acceleration through fiscal year 2023 as improving supply allows us to expedite delivery of as-a-service solutions to our customers. Our as-a-service order decline of 20% in Q1 is a function of a difficult compare to Q1 2022, in which orders grew 136% on strength from several large deals, including a large public cloud customer. We are comfortable with our robust pipeline of as-a-Service business. We base this confidence on our 68% order growth in fiscal year 2022, the number of deals currently pending acceptance and our current view of the sales funnel. We, therefore, retain our three-year ARR target of 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2025. Most importantly, we continue to make our as-a-Service business more valuable with a growing mix of higher-margin software and services recurring revenue. In Q1 2023, our mix of software and services increased another 150 basis points year-over-year to 65%, thanks to our cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in edge and storage. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. I would like to remind you that, all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we delivered a second consecutive record revenue quarter and surpassed the $1 billion revenue milestone for the first time. We grew our revenue 31% year-over-year. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share with our combination of wireless LAN, enterprise switching and SD-WAN solutions, including in some of the largest enterprise customers. Customers are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as our edge service platform, automation suite. Our operating margin of 21.9% was up 450 basis points annually and 860 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from scale and our prior price increases have worked through our order book. We are very, very pleased that our edge business has exceeded the rule of 40 this quarter and feel very optimistic about the prospects of our Aruba business in fiscal year 2023 and beyond, given its substantial order book underpinned by a superior platform-based SaaS offerings. We retain confidence in our long-term targets of mid-teens revenue growth and mid-20% operating margins. In HPC and AI, revenue grew 37% year-over-year. We successfully closed the balance of the Frontier deal in Q1, which contributed to the strength of this business in Q1 2023. While the segment is also now benefiting from easing supply chain, the lumpiness and long lead times of this business mean that operating margins will continue to fluctuate. As Antonio mentioned, we have been thinking strategically about and investing behind Artificial Intelligence for many years. This is true both organically and inorganically. The emergence of large language models such as ChatGPT and BART and generative AI, some of which run on our systems has prompted many questions from our customer base. We believe AI at scale is a high-growth market and then the building and refinement of AI models will require unique computational capabilities that our Cray supercomputers and HPI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable. We intend to invest organically and inorganically as listed by our acquisition of Pachyderm to fully grasp this opportunity. With regards to storage, we are pleased to report 10% annual growth, where we are bolstering our portfolio to grow market share. HPE Alletra remains one of our fastest-growing new product introductions ever, and grew well above triple-digits in Q1. HPE Alletra contributed to double-digit growth in our own IP products, which is driving a mix shift to higher-margin, software-intensive as-a-Service revenue. We continue to invest in R&D for our own IP products in this business unit. And as a result, our Q1 operating margin of 12% is down 190 basis points year-over-year. Compute revenues grew 19% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. The segment benefited from the multi-sourcing and demand steaming initiatives we have discussed in prior calls as well as steadily improving supply availability. Our dynamic pricing strategy has helped us navigate a volatile supply climate while driving industry-leading gross margins. Our Compute operating margin of 17.6% exceeded our long-term outlook of 11% to 13% for the fifth consecutive quarter, which attests to our best-in-class performance. We do believe our Compute operating margins are peaking and should gradually return to our target range of 11% to 13%. While we are seeing commodities costs decreasing, leading to increased competitive price pressure, we have for the first time three concurrent and differentiated platforms being sold in the market, Gen10, Gen10 Plus and Gen11, which would allow a gradual management of pricing and margins over time. In our Pointnext Operational Services business, combined with Storage services, orders declined mid- to high single-digits and revenues were flat year-over-year, driven by uneven demand. As you know, this is a key component of recurring revenues and profit for each of our segments. Finally, HPE Financial Services revenues rose 8% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.6 billion grew 21% in constant currency. Our operating margins fell 300 basis points year-over-year due to the higher interest rate climate that we will gradually offset over time through pricing. Time and time again, our HPFS business has proven resilience in downturn, thanks to the quality of the underwriting of the book of business. Throughout the pandemic, I'd like to remind you, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our loss ratio is back to pre-pandemic levels of approximately 50 basis points. Slide 8 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. We are very pleased that the progress we are making again our edge-to-cloud strategy is evidence in the financial results we have delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We have grown both our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to record or near-record levels in Q1 2023. This illustrates not only the commercial success of our products in the marketplace, but also our ability to generate healthy margins. I am particularly pleased to see that our focus on supply chain execution has enabled the attainment of record revenues despite a substantial year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange rates that impacted revenue growth by 550 basis points in Q1 2023. Slide 9 illustrates the progress we have made in our gross margin structure. Our Q1 2023 non-GAAP gross margin is up 30 basis points year-over-year. We generated $2.7 billion in gross profit in Q1 2023, which is yet another quarterly record. Our gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of our strategic pricing actions through the period of supply challenges in fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2022. It is also illustrative of the long-term favorable mix shift we are driving. Despite a strong compute quarter, our revenue mix of computing at 44% was flat year-over-year. This illustrates that we have a larger revenue base as our higher-margin segments are growing rapidly, and our as-a-service strategy is gaining momentum. Slide 10 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margins for which reached 11.8% in Q1 '23. This is up 30 basis points sequentially and 80 basis points year-over-year. It is also a record quarterly non-GAAP operating margin for the company. Our very strong Q1 revenue performance and our resilient gross margins are the leading contributors to the operating margin expansion. Unlike many tech companies that have announced layoffs recently, we have strong momentum at HPE with a combination of our improved cost structure, substantial order book and outstanding execution, delivering profitable growth that is increasingly recurring at higher margins as our as-a-service transformation continues to unfold. Again, let me reiterate that Antonio and I are determined to maintain this focus on profitable growth and productivity for the future. Let's now turn to discuss H3C. As you know, we've chosen to exercise our put options on our shares in H3C. We took this decision to carefully weigh the financial implications of remaining in the joint venture with the risk-reward profile of exercising the put. We are confident that we have made the decision that is in the best interest of our shareholders. HPE and our partner, Unisplendour continue to have strive discussions to reach agreement on the determination of the final purchase price of HPE shares in HPC and enter into a share purchase agreement. We will keep you updated \u2013 please keep in mind that, our decision to exercise the put is distinct from the commercial agreements with H3C. We intend to continue to do business in China through both our direct sales and through H3C and we remain committed to serving our customers in China. I would like to remind you that, we will continue to recognize the value of the dividends we received from H3C in our financials until the transaction is complete and I'm happy to report H3C results remains healthy despite uncertainty in the Chinese economy. Our first fiscal year from a cash flow perspective is typically a down quarter for cash flow. In Q1 2023, we had outflows of $800 million in cash flow from operations. And $1.3 billion in free cash flow. Working capital was a use of cash due to timing of receipts, payments, and continue investments in inventory, which has driven our cash flow conversion cycle from negative 14 days in Q4 to positive 15 days in Q1 2023. More specifically, our accounts payable balance was reduced by $2.2 billion quarter-over-quarter and was the main driver for negative operating cash flow and affected our cash flow conversion cycle. Also we have made significant investment in HPEFS volumes to drive future growth in subsequent quarters. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of fiscal year 2023 and reiterate our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. Now let's turn to our outlook slide on Slide 13. As we have mentioned, demand for our products and services was more uneven in Q1 2023 across our business than it was in Q4 2022. Having said that, we also believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive market share gains and are entering Q2 2023 with a substantial order book relative to pre-pandemic levels. We have strong momentum in Q1 2023 and we are now turning our focus to invest in sustaining that momentum in the second half of 2023 and fiscal year 2024 in a context of continuous macroeconomic uncertainty. Let me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure, or exit from Russia and Belarus in 2022 and foreign exchange risk. I would like to remind you that approximately 50% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies. For Q2 2023, we expect revenues in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion at every point of the range. This represents 9% year-over-year growth in reported dollars. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.27 to $0.35 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.52. This outlook assumes the current level of demand we have been experiencing remain unchanged. And then we continue to make progress on the delivery of our order book. To sum it up, I am very pleased with our Q1 results and guidance for Q2. We also understand some of our end markets are likely to remain uneven in the near-term. We had indicated at our last earnings announcement that our financial performance in fiscal year 2023 is likely to be more weighted \u2013 more weighted to the first half of the year than is typical. Given the strong Q1 performance, momentum and substantial order book we continue to have, we are lifting our full year guidance accordingly. We are now targeting 5% to 7% revenue growth adjusted for currency, which is at the midpoint, twice our prior revenue growth guidance, non-GAAP operating profit growth of 5% to 6%, GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.40 to $1.48. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2.02 to $2.10 and free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Specifically for OI&E, we benefited in Q1 2023 from one-off foreign exchange gains that accounted for $0.02 to $0.03 per share. These are unlikely to repeat in the rest of the fiscal year. Given the high interest rate environment is expected to remain unchanged, we expect OI&E to be an expense of $20 million to $40 million on a full year basis. This explains our fiscal year 2023 EPS guidance range of $2.02 to $2.10, which incorporates $0.06 of the $0.09 beat in Q1 2023. In terms of capital returns, we will return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. We are maintaining our dividend and expect to repurchase at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023. So to conclude, our results speak for themselves, and we continue to execute better than the competition. While many tech companies are playing defense with layoffs, we see fiscal year 2023 as an opportunity to accelerate the execution of our strategy. Antonio and I look forward to continuing our execution momentum through fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you. Sure. So thank you for remarking that our revenue guide at the midpoint is effectively doubling from the prior guide that we gave. The prior guide that we gave was 2% to 4%. We're now guiding 5% to 7%. So at the midpoint, it is 6%, which is double what we gave previously. And in giving that guide, we factor in a number of elements. First of all, the macro environment, second of all foreign exchange rates; and third of all, our desire to continue to invest to perpetrate the momentum that we have in the second half and in fiscal year 2024 because there's always something else that we have to think about for the end of the year, and we're not done yet. I also want to flag that we believe that commodity costs are coming down in particular areas, which should effectively come with added pricing pressure in compute, and this is also something that we have factored into our guidance. But if you really think about our non-GAAP operating profit growth. The prior guide was at 4% to 5% growth, and now we're guiding 5% to 6% growth, and we feel comfortable with the information we have on the macro, foreign exchange cetera, that our guide is appropriate. I would simply add to what Antonio said, look, the edge have broken the $1 billion revenue bar. I think now we are entering a phase with all the additions that we're making to the portfolio. We're entering a phase of a new watermark level. We have built at the edge with Antonio and the management team, one of the most comprehensive portfolio of the entire industry. And it is really, really winning shares even in the largest customer segments, thanks to the Edge-to-Cloud platform that Aruba has built and that powers GreenLake in everything we do. Yes. So thank you, Amit, for the question on H3C. We exercised the put, as you recall, towards the end of the calendar year of 2022. And we are right now in the process of agreeing the value of our stake with our partners of Unigroup. And this process is going to take a few month and it's going to -- we expect it to complete towards the end of calendar year 2023, and we feel reasonably good about the prospects. For the meantime, we continue to consolidate H3C and benefit from the dividends that we received from the company. And we are not deconsolidating H3C at this stage. It's most likely going to be the case of the end of fiscal year 2023 when that will happen. And at that point, we will advise both on the impact of dilution from deconsolidation and also the use of proceeds once we receive them. I would like to also emphasize that we continue to have commercial agreements with H3C, notwithstanding, the exercise of the put, those commercial agreements are distinct from the exercise of the put, and we will continue to generate value through those commercial agreements that we have with H3C. Okay. A lot of questions into one question, but I will try my best. So first and foremost, the revenue growth that we are targeting for the full year is 5% to 7%, which at the midpoint is 6%, which is double what we originally anticipated. And that is because of all the puts and takes in our portfolio and the way we see supply easing on one side, also demand continuing unevenly although across our portfolio. And if you really look at our EPS guide, one thing I would like to emphasize for everyone on the call is that we did beat the midpoint of our guide by $0.09 and $0.03 of that beat pertained to OI&E and had to do with foreign exchange gains that are not operational. We continue to view OI&E on the full year basis being an expense of US$20 million to US$40 million due to elevated interest expenses. And there is also in our guidance, the potential impact from FX volatility. And so what is baked into our guidance is just that our current view to the best of our knowledge, of the macro environment, the impact of interest rates and also the impact of foreign exchange rates that we see at this stage, knowing that things can evolve. It's also important to note that this is our first quarter. We still have nine months to go, and we want to make sure that we remain prudent in the current circumstance where the macro environment remains uncertain. Oh, yes. Thank you, Antonio, and thank you, Wamsi. This gives me the opportunity to remind everybody that at SAM in last October, we flagged at least a $0.30 headwind from foreign exchange this fiscal year. Quite honestly, the headwind we have experienced in this quarter of 550 basis points is above what we anticipated. We still feel that we can attain our new guide on revenue growth and EPS, notwithstanding the current FX headwinds and but things can always evolve and this is why we remain prudent in our full year guide, with regards to revenue and EPS growth. So that 30-plus percent EPS impact from FX has risen, but we are managing it and factoring it into our new guide. Yes."

Finally, Antonio and Marie will reference our earnings presentation and their prepared comments. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\nAntonio Neri : Thank you, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today. Before I share my comments on our quarterly and yearly performance, I would like to provide an update on the Juniper Network's acquisition. We have received approvals from key geographies around the world, including the European Union, UK, India, South Korea and Australia, which have given unconditional clearance and see the competitive benefits of the transaction. In the United States, we are engaged with the Department of Justice, and we expect the review will continue in the coming into the new calendar year. We anticipate the deal will close in the early part of 2025, within the previously stated timeframe. Both HPE and Juniper continue to believe the transaction will enable us to provide a complete portfolio of modern, secure networking solutions that offer essential foundations for both Hybrid Cloud and AI. The combined companies' enhanced ability to compete and innovate will fundamentally improve the networking industry. This transaction will also strengthen U.S. National Security interests by advancing HPE's position as a strong U.S. Innovator among global technology companies. Turning to results, we had an exceptional fourth quarter to cap off a strong year. In actual dollar terms, we generate a record quarterly revenue of $8.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year, exceeding $8 billion for the first time in our history. Our results reflect the continued adoption of HPE GreenLake and the acceleration of our revenue growth in AI. Q4 and fiscal year 2024 results exceeded our expectations for revenue, dilute and net earnings per share and free cash flow. We draw sequential revenue growth across each of our segments, a continuation of the positive momentum we saw build throughout the year across our business. Q4 constituted our third consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year growth rates and revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Contributed significantly to our performance was record server revenue of $4.7 billion, up 31% year-over-year, a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Sequentially, AI systems revenue was up 16% to $1.5 billion, exiting fiscal year 2024 with $6.7 billion in cumulative orders since Q1 of fiscal year 2023. After the close of Q4, I am pleased to share that our AI systems demand remains strong. We have received new orders bringing AI systems backlog to over $3.5 billion. Our traditional server business also continues to reflect the [improvement market dynamics] (ph) as we draw our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit orders growth. Hybrid cloud revenue grew 18% year-over-year and 21% sequentially, resulting in revenue of $1.6 billion, with increasing revenue for HPE Private Cloud and continued growth in HPE Storage. We are seeing customers like Lupin Limited, a large India pharmaceutical company, repatriate workloads from the public cloud to enhance their data security amid regulatory and compliance requirements. Customer adoption of our HPE Alletra Storage MP solutions continues to rise at an accelerated pace. Since launch, we have sold approximately 3,000 systems. Miami-Dade County, the seventh most populous county in the United States, implemented HPE Alletra Storage MP to consolidate an existing storage footprint to lower TCO and improve performance and sustainability. Our Intelligent Edge business achieved its third consecutive quarter of orders growth, reflecting our expectations for an improving demand environment. We are particularly pleased with the double-digit year-over-year orders growth that we saw in data center networking, an important growth market for our HPE Aruba Networking business. HPE financial services financing volumes of $2.1 billion rose to an all-time high this quarter, driven by strong demand for HPE GreenLake and AI Financing. It is clear customers need more investment capacity whether to deploy AI or to accelerate the adoption of [Hybrid Cloud] (ph). Our record-breaking revenue performance in Q4 resulted in record profitability with non-GAAP operating profit of $938 million. That translated to non-GAAP operating margin of more than 11%, a 110 basis points increase sequentially. As a result of our exceptional Q4 performance, fiscal year 2024 revenue growth topped 3% year-over-year, exceeding $30 billion as we added more than 9,000 new customers across the portfolio. Combined with our discipline operating expense management, which accelerated in the back-half of the year, we generated a record-breaking $2.3 billion in free cash flow, exceeding our guidance of at least $1.9 billion for the year. We closed the year on a strong note, exceeding our full year commitments for revenue, diluted net earnings per share, and free cash flow. We are very pleased with our results and excited about the opportunities ahead for HPE. It is clear our strategy is working. We have a tremendous set of assets, including extensive solutions from-edge to-cloud, enabling us to meet our customer needs across AI, networking, and hybrid cloud. Providing a full stack of product and services clearly differentiates us versus our competition and accelerates value for our shareholders. In Q4, we continue our investment in innovation, which further enhances our product portfolio and positions us to capture additional market share. AI is clearly transformative for our customers, and HPE is positioned to lead in the next wave of innovation. At our recent AI day, we announced the industry-first, 100% fanless direct liquid cooling architecture, a critical capability for customers to leverage the next generation of direct liquid cooled GPUs and CPUs, while facilitating peak performance as they manage increased energy densities. This industry-first architecture is unique to HPE and results from decades of experience in liquid cooling technologies. Two weeks ago, at SC24, we announced our newest 400 gigabits HPE Slingshot Direct Liquid Cool networking fabric of products, engineered to support both generative AI cluster workloads and exascale supercomputing. These innovations are enhancing the performance of our AI systems and supercomputing product lines, differentiating us from the competition. At SC24, we also announced that HPE has delivered the fastest verified supercomputer in the world to the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. El Capitan is not only the world's fastest supercomputer at more than 1.7 exaflop, it is also among the most energy efficient in the world. HPE now has deployed seven of the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, including numbers one, two, and three on the list. We also continue to innovate to help accelerate enterprise adoption of AI. Since launching HPE Private Cloud AI, we have expanded our collaboration with Deloitte to help businesses of all sizes to deploy AI solutions tailored for their industry-specific use cases such as C-suite AI and many others. In addition, we introduced the Unleash AI Partner Program to grow our ecosystem and expand customers' ability to address their AI use cases with HPE Private Cloud AI. While we are still in early days, interest is strong with hundreds of customers in the pipeline, with many compelling proof-of-concept underway. We closed our first deals during Q4, including RWE, a leading company in the field of renewable energy, which selected HPE Private Cloud AI to unlock insights from weather data. Customers are also asking us to help them simplify their VMware private clouds and optimize their virtualization costs. At HPE Discover Barcelona 2 weeks ago, we launched HPE VM Essentials, which enables customers to manage their virtualization states across HPE VMware and many others. We have built on our recent acquisitions of Morpheus Data and OpsRamp, giving customers operational flexibility and allowing them to no longer be locked into a single virtualization vendor. With HPE VM Essentials, they can achieve up to 5 times lower TCO. As a part of our HPE VM Essentials, we also provide an enterprise-grade open-source KVM virtualization solution. This allows customers to dramatically reduce costs, while increasing their flexibility to innovate across a full suite of hybrid cloud operations capabilities in an on-premises multi-stack and a multi-cloud public environment. In storage, we continue to invest in our multi-protocol HPE Alletra Storage MP platform as we transition our storage portfolio to an AI-driven, cloud-native, and disaggregated architecture. Our new HPE Alletra Storage MP X 10000 is a revolutionary new high-performance object storage designed for AI exabyte scale and optimized for high-speed unstructured data lakes with [rapid] (ph) restore for backup and recovery. Our AWS S3 compatible object storage interface and deduplication, supports up to 20 times data reduction and streamlines integration with any available backup solution in the market. With HPE Alletra Storage MP X 10000, customers can achieve up to 6 times faster object storage performance compared to competitor solutions in the market. Finally, our Innovation Intelligent Edge are helping us to advance HPE Aruba Networking Central with AIOps copilot capabilities built into our HPE GreenLake cloud. During the quarter, we announced two new solutions to enhance the networking operators experience and security for our customers. The first is the integration with HPE OpsRamp to monitor third-party devices. We also introduced a behavioral analytical-based network detection and response capability, where we are leveraging network and telemetry to train AI models to monitor customer IoT devices. We have an important place in the market, as a leading technology innovator. I am proud that HPE team members around the globe, bring our innovations to customers every day to help them modernize their IT infrastructure and transform for the better. I am very pleased with our exceptional fourth quarter results and the resulting outperformance in several of our full year commitments to our shareholders. Our strategy is well aligned to the mega trends reshaping networking, hybrid cloud, and AI, and our unique product portfolio is well-positioned to capture new customers and accelerate value for our shareholders. We expect the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks to further enhance our portfolio providing customers with complete edge-to-cloud solutions. I am extremely excited about the significant opportunity we have in the coming fiscal year to drive increased value for our shareholders. I am optimistic about what we can achieve and look forward to the year ahead. Now let me turn the call over to Marie, who will provide more details about our Q4 results and guide for the first quarter. Marie?\nMarie Myers: Thank you, Antonio and good afternoon. We ended fiscal 2024 on solid footing and exceeded what we said we would do. We achieved record quarterly revenue, delivered solid profitability, and generated free cash flow above our guidance. We executed well in a dynamic environment, growing revenue sequentially in each segment as investments in AI are leading to infrastructure refreshes. In Q4, we also maintained disciplined cost management and improved non-GAAP operating profit. A few highlights from our 2024 results. We grew AI systems revenue more than 150% to $4.1 billion and met our server non-GAAP operating margin target. We continued our product transition within storage and ended the year with Alletra MP accounting for a meaningful portion of total storage orders. Our transition to more software defined storage will drive a greater mix of higher-margin recurring revenue over the long-term. Lastly, in Intelligent Edge, we rightsized our cost structure as we navigated a digestion period. We grew fiscal 2024 revenue 3% to $30.1 billion exceeding the high-end of the outlook range we provided in September. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.99 and free cash flow of $2.3 billion both came in above our revised outlook ranges. In total we returned $826 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Overall, our results reflect focused execution and improving demand as customers implement AI strategies. Let me dive into the details of the quarter. We delivered record quarterly revenue and our second highest non-GAAP diluted net EPS, both of which came in above the high end of guidance. Total revenue grew 15% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter to a record $8.5 billion. Growth in the quarter was led by strong conversion of AI systems backlog, refreshes in traditional compute, better than expected performance within Hybrid Cloud, and a continued recovery in networking. We are pleased to report non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.58 above the high-end of guidance despite dilution from the issuance of our convertible preferred securities in September which was not factored into our outlook. ARR grew 48% year-over-year to $1.9 billion, nearly doubling since Q1 2023 primarily driven by HPE GreenLake. We added approximately 2,000 new HPE GreenLake customers during the quarter ending the year with approximately 39,000 unique customers. I am happy to report continued demand for our differentiated AI system offerings, which resulted in strong double-digit sequential revenue growth to $1.5 billion. This record contribution from AI systems revenue, combined with lower mix of Intelligent Edge, drove gross margin down 390 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 30.9%. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 9% year-over-year, as reported and were down $5 million quarter-over-quarter, as we focus on streamlining our cost structure and are closely managing discretionary expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin was 11.1%, up 140 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. Strong profitability rolled through to free cash flow, which exceeded our expectations and totaled $1.5 billion. Fiscal 2024 free cash flow was $2.3 billion our highest ever for the full year. GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.99 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.58 were both above guidance, benefiting from better than expected OI&E and expense management. GAAP EPS benefited primarily from a lower than previously expected tax expense on our aggregated H3C dispositions. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS excludes the gain, we recognized on the partial sale of our H3C investment at $162 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and other related charges and amortization of intangibles. Now let's turn to the segment results. Our server business was a key driver of record quarterly revenue and grew double digits year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter. Server revenue achieved an all-time high of $4.7 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter with sequential growth in AI systems and traditional servers. The traditional compute business continued its momentum during the quarter and grew sequentially for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by ongoing refreshes to our Gen11 server products, which carry higher AUPs. Adoption has been strongest in North America and Europe, as customers are investing in new workloads. In the fourth quarter, Gen11 accounted for more than two-thirds of our core compute revenue and contributed to AUP growth. In AI systems, we continue to grow the business to new highs. AI systems orders during the quarter were in-line with our expectations at approximately $1.2 billion. However, we had an order [de-book] (ph) in Q4, leaving our net orders for the quarter at approximately $500 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have received orders that bring our current backlog to over $3.5 billion. As we have mentioned before, AI systems orders can be lumpy and this is an example of that. Fourth quarter server operating margin was 11.6%, up 150 basis points year-over-year and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Moving to Hybrid Cloud, we grew revenue 18% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter to $1.6 billion, materially exceeding our guidance of a slight revenue increase. Revenue growth was led by Private Cloud and the continued ramp of Alletra MP. During the quarter, we received our first orders for Private Cloud AI as we target a growing pipeline that includes corporations across verticals and regions. Interest is strong in manufacturing, education, and financial services. We have also deployed Private Cloud AI internally and are moving use cases from the public cloud due to better cost performance and compliance. In storage, we are balancing investments in owned IP products against market trends. Alletra MP remains ahead of our expectations and is the fastest ramping storage product in our company's history. Keep in mind, these sales carry a higher portion of deferred software and services revenue, which takes longer to translate to the P&L but benefits margins long-term. Hybrid Cloud operating margin was 7.7%, up 390 basis points year-over-year and up 260 basis points sequentially, predominantly due to better OpEx controls. Now on to Intelligent Edge. We believe the business remains at a path of recovery and customers have largely digested excess inventories. Total Intelligent Edge revenue was $1.1 billion, down 20% year-over-year and essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Sequentially, we saw growth in services, WLAN products and software, partially offset by declines in switching and campus. Importantly, we are seeing more large deals in our pipeline, giving us confidence that demand is improving. Keep in mind, we were still benefiting from the drawdown of networking backlog in Q1 of fiscal 2024. Operating margin of 24.4% was down 270 basis points year-over-year but up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to lower OpEx in-line with our expectations. Lastly, Financial Services. Our Financial Services business generated $893 million of revenue, up 2% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Financing volumes increased 41% year-over-year to a new all-time high of $2.1 billion. Our Q4 loss ratio remained steady near 0.5% and return on equity totaled 17%. Operating margin was 9.2%, up 120 basis points year-over-year and up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Moving to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated strong operating cash flow of $2 billion and free cash flow of $1.5 billion in the quarter, both of which exceeded our expectations due to higher revenue and increased collections. For the full year, free cash flow was a record $2.3 billion, above our guidance of $1.9 billion. Q4 cash conversion cycle was a negative 12 days, down 8 days from Q4 '23 and down 16 days from last quarter. Inventory ended the year at $7.8 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter due to the nature of our AI systems business. We are focused on reducing inventory during fiscal 2025 as we convert AI systems backlog and grow our storage business. During Q4, we returned $169 million via dividends and $50 million via share repurchases to common shareholders, respectively. We returned a total of $826 million during the full year. Moving to our outlook for fiscal Q1 2025. As Antonio said, we expect to close the Juniper transaction in early 2025 at which time we will provide combined company guidance for fiscal 2025. However, let me provide some high-level thoughts, as to how we are thinking about the upcoming year. Overall customer conversations indicate higher IT spending in 2025 with multiple tailwinds that should contribute to revenue growth. We expect continued recovery in traditional compute and growing adoption of AI systems by enterprises and sovereigns, although we expect orders to remain competitive and lumpy. In Hybrid Cloud, we are beginning to see customers accelerate digital transformation projects in order to execute on AI strategies. And in networking, we expect demand will modestly recover throughout the year. For the first quarter we expect year-over-year revenue growth to be in the mid-teens. On a sequential basis, this is in-line with normal seasonality. We expect server revenue to be down quarter-over-quarter. We expect flat to modest growth sequentially in traditional compute and lower AI systems contribution following a very strong quarter. Server operating margin will be closer to 10% to 11%, as customers navigate the transition to next-gen GPUs. In Hybrid Cloud, we expect a sequential decline in the first quarter due to stronger than seasonal growth in Q4, with operating margin in the mid-single-digit range. And in networking, we are still managing prolonged sales cycles and expect the business to be around historical seasonality of flattish sequential growth. We expect Intelligent Edge operating margin to be in the low 20% range due to mix. Gross margin will benefit from a more favorable revenue mix, and we expect a modest sequential decrease in OpEx. OI&E is expected to positively contribute to the bottom-line with higher net interest income more than offsetting $0.02 of headwinds associated with the cost of our Juniper Financing. Overall, we estimate Q1 GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.31 and $0.36 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.47 and $0.52 based on 1.4 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding, including $76 million of dilution from our convertible preferred securities. For free cash flow, we typically consume cash in the first quarter. We intend to procure components needed to meet current and future AI systems demand, while continuing to manage inventory. For Q1, we intend to buy back shares of common stock at a similar pace to Q4. We remain committed in the long-term to our balanced capital allocation framework, our dividend, and our investment-grade rating. In summary, we delivered strong Q4 results and ended fiscal 2025, well positioned to drive profitable growth and generate free cash flow that we can reinvest into the business while also returning capital to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question today will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi, yes. Thank you so much. Congrats on the strong quarter and guide, especially given the dilution from the preferred stock. As we look at your AI business, the -- can you maybe give us some sense of how your AI pipeline is shaping up, given that the backlog levels kind of dipped in the quarter? And I know you made some comments about how it's backed up intra-quarter. But can you give us some sense of how the pipeline looks and what the composition of that could be? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. This is Antonio. And good afternoon. The pipeline is a multiple of the current backlog which we shared as of a day ago, which is basically more than $3.5 billion. And inside our pipeline, obviously remember there is four key segments of the market. Obviously, the biggest driver continues to be what I call segment one or model builders, hyperscalers as well as now the Tier 2, Tier 3 that they are in the business to provide GPU capacity on demand on a per hour basis. So they continue to be the two biggest driver. But what I'm really pleased, and Maria and I have made those comments in our remarks, is the fact that we see now the enterprise AI pipeline continue to grow steadily. There are hundreds of customers on that pipeline. The size of the deal will vary obviously because it's not the same size of the deal of the other two segments. But there are some very interesting large-sized deals in the pipeline, and they are doing proof-of-concept. But the positive news is that, remember that we made the announcement of the offer that co-engineered solution with NVIDIA in June, and we made it available only on September 9. So really, we had 7 weeks to be able to collect orders. We already collected orders in enterprise AI and we already closed deals in enterprise AI. And two weeks ago, we made additional enhancement to the offer, particularly with a partner ecosystem, including Deloitte. So very pleased. This is going to be a growth driver in 2025, as we go forward. And then on the first [segment] (ph), obviously, the transition, I would say, to the latest GPUs that will happen over the course of the next few quarters.\nPaul Glaser: Okay, Wamsi. Next question please.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks and congrats on the quarter. Maybe diving into gross margins. Can you just talk about some of the puts and takes on maybe particularly server margin this quarter and just kind of the weight of some of the XD servers versus El Capitan recognition? Or just some of the dynamics that play on gross margins would be helpful. Thank you.\nMarie Myers: Hi, Meta, good afternoon. It's Marie. And first of all, I'll just add up by saying, as you know, we typically don't get into gross margin at the segment level, but let me give you some color around how we think about our op margins. First of all, I'd say look, from a service segment perspective, really pleased with the performance in the quarter. We were at 11.6%. And if you think about it, we actually had our highest ever AI server revenue of $1.5 billion. So I think you can see just the performance there. In terms of the color and how to think about it, El Capitan actually was included in the quarter so we did actually get the final acceptances. A couple of points to note. If you look at the mix inside server, we see traditional compute particularly Gen11, we're about two-thirds of the mix so far to-date, and that particularly has higher configurations. And as a result, it is driving richer AUPs and obviously higher structural margins. And also, frankly, we've been really successful about passing over commodity costs. And if you look at both the GPU servers, it is competitive but you can see the revenue scale is helping us out there. And then finally, I think we've been really prudent with our cost controls and all of that's playing off in terms of our OpEx discipline. So that's how we're thinking about server margins.\nAntonio Neri: But in addition to what Marie said Meta, is this was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year orders growth in the traditional server. And when I think about the opportunity ahead of us, there are just for HPE, 0.5 million units in the installed base that must be refreshed for several reasons number one, they are doing very little work and consuming a lot of energy. Number two is because they have reaching or they are reaching the depreciation cycle. And when enterprise customers think about deployment of AI, they need to free up space, power and cooling to absorb this new system. So this is a big opportunity for us, both from a units perspective and obviously Gen11 comes with a different configuration, as Marie said, and then the services touch that comes with it.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you Meta. Next question please.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. I was hoping I could ask a two-parter on the AI service. First, can you just clarify that de-book comment that came in? It sounds like $700 million de-book of backlog. Was that a competitive loss or someone had double ordered or something else that was going on there? And then the second part, following on the gross margin. Can you talk a little bit about when you're looking at AI business, what are the metrics you are looking at? Are you -- do you have thresholds for gross margin or cash flow or something else that prohibits you from going at certain deals where maybe ODMs or lower gross margin OEMs would go? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Sure, and thank you for the question. As we said before, orders during the quarter were in-line with our expectations. In fact, we booked $1.2 billion of new orders in Q4. However, we de-booked a large order, which was $700 million during the same quarter because we had concern with a specific customer. And we proud ourselves of a very strong control of this environment, and we continue to be very vigilant about how we engage and making sure we manage the risk. And we felt that already carried a lot of risk, and therefore we felt it was very prudent to de-book it and focus on other areas of the business. And that's why as we keep going throughout the next few weeks, up to yesterday, we ended up with a backlog now which is more over the $3.5 billion. So that's what happened. It has nothing to do with competitive. It has nothing to do with everything else. We had a concern with a specific customer, and we decided it was prudent to de-book it.\nMarie Myers: Yes. And Tim, just to add on how we think about margin structure and AI systems, I think we've said this in the past, but look we have a framework that we use for our pricing, and it's absolutely our intention to remain disciplined both on cost and price as we pursue profitable growth. I think that has been our mantra. But obviously then, we're out there balancing those gross margin pressures with cost control, strategic buys, and you've seen that in terms of our pricing discipline. And I would add -- and I think Antonio made this comment earlier that we do see over time, improving profitability as the market moves more to, I think, the two sectors that Antonio referred to, both in terms of sovereign and enterprise where we see services attach, et cetera. So just use that as a way to think about the longer-term sort of margin structure as well.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you Tim. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question today will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess if I just look at the corporate level, you've had a couple of quarters with gross margins have been down a fair bit year-over-year. I think it was [down like 390] (ph) basis points this quarter. Could you just talk like, A, what's driving this gross margin degradation for you folks? But it clearly looks like you're able to offset all of this with some really good OpEx control. [As we just] (ph) talk about what's driving the gross margin decline? And then how low can you take OpEx at this point, given your expectations for revenue growth in the next fiscal year? Thank you.\nMarie Myers: Yes, no worries Amit. Good afternoon. It's Marie. So why don't I take that one? On gross margin, so for Q4, as you rightly said, it was 30.9% so we're down both on a year-on-year and Q-on-Q basis. If you step back and look at the overall revenue mix, perhaps one of the largest drivers is really just the lower contribution of the Intelligent Edge revenue. And in fact, in Q4, Amit, it was actually the lowest for the entire year. And obviously, we had a higher contribution inside of servers of AI systems revenue and product mix. So that obviously impacted gross margin. But what I would say is despite that headwind, we actually grew gross profit dollars both year-on-year and Q-on-Q. Now going forward, I think I said in my prepared remarks that we do actually expect to see gross margin will be up modestly in terms of the improved business mix and predominantly, that's driven by the Intelligent Edge mix. But from a longer-term perspective, just two things to keep in mind. First of all obviously, when we closed Juniper, that is going to be a big driver and has a very positive impact on both gross and operating. We expect that 50% of operating profit going forward will come from Juniper. And secondly as I mentioned earlier I think when I answered Tim's question, we do expect, particularly in the AI space, those higher margin opportunities as we move more into seeing the adoption of sovereign and enterprise. On the cost side of the house, really pleased with the work we've done so far to-date. We've been really focused on discretionary costs throughout '24. We're moving more into areas of productivity. Amit, as we look at '25, we are actually using GenAI inside the company, using it in finance to help drive productivity. So we see opportunities like that throughout the company. I would just say at a company as large as HPE, there's plenty of opportunity, Amit.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you Amit. Next question please.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you for taking the questions. I think in your commentary on the outlook, you indicated that traditional servers would be flattish to even slightly up sequentially in the January quarter, which I think defies seasonality. So I just want to verify if I got that correct. Maybe if you could unpack what's happening in that part of the business. Thank you.\nMarie Myers: Yes. So this is Marie here, Simon. So yes, you did get that correct in terms of servers. And I think I did mention in my prepared remarks that we did see a lower AI mix in terms of server systems in Q1. And I think as we've said in the past, this business is lumpy so you just bear that in mind as you think about it. In terms of traditional servers and the outlook on the business, really nothing's changed. We continue to see the momentum in that business. I think Antonio described it very well earlier when he mentioned two-thirds of the mix is already at Gen11 in traditional servers, and we see that continuing. So don't expect that to change fundamentally. But just remember, it's a pretty competitive environment out there, both for both traditional servers and AI systems right now in the market. So that's the way I'd sort of think about it. So that's why we felt it was prudent, given the current backlog we've got to guide 10% to 11% right now.\nAntonio Neri: Also, Simon obviously, in addition to the traditional yearly seasonality, now we have gone back to the normal seasonality we used to have a few years ago when [we had just] (ph) for the COVID and the recovery that happened after that. On the AI side, one-third -- more than one-third of our backlog is Blackwell-related. And so you need to consider that -- the trajectory of that more than $3.5 billion being Blackwell-related. You need time to convert that into revenue. And that's why Marie mentioned the lumpiness of revenue conversion sometime or the orders intake. But notwithstanding, we are very pleased with the revenue we had in Q4. We are confident about the continued growth in 2025, as we transition the GPUs to this new type of silicon.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you Simon. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question today will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Antonio, kind of building off of that last comment, I'm curious as we think about the Blackwell platform cycle ahead of us and your comment on the [backlog build] (ph) that you're seeing. Can you just update us where -- I think a lot of that initial demand seems to be centered around the GB200 NVL, that rack scale system. Where does HPE stand on that platform shipping those system configurations? When do you think that those would ship in volume for HPE? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. I think you're right, Aaron. I think again, in the segmentation, I'd like to operate within the segment 1 and 2, call it, service provider, hyperscalers, and model builders. They tend to lead with the latest technology, and that transition is going to happen over '25. And so obviously, we are working with the customers and NVIDIA as they become available, and we will be shipping those in volume in 2025. And so when you think about calendar year right, I will say, in the first half of 2025 is when you start seeing growth in that platform. In the sovereign space, I don't think that's the case. I think it's a mix of multiple configurations because they are different type of workloads. And then in enterprise I argue, it will be an N minus 1 or 2, because the enterprise is less about Blackwell or Grace Blackwell. It's more about the simplicity of the deployment and the time to value. And that's why when you look at today, our HPE Private Cloud AI is all now based on H100. And so -- and that's plenty for what they do, whether it's dragging a model or fine-tuning a model or doing inferencing. So that's why you can generalize things here, but it is fair to say people in the business to build and train models will lead with the latest technology and they will transition in the first half of 2025. And then the enterprise will stay 1 or 2 generations behind because obviously, they'll need all that computing power.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you Aaron. Next question please.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: Hi yes. Thank you. I'm not sure if you said it but perhaps you can just confirm, did your AI pipeline grow sequentially? And then on the Hybrid Cloud side, it was a huge jump sequentially, dramatically higher than your guidance as well and the biggest sequential increase we've ever seen. Was there any unusually large deal in there? I know you closed Morpheus also but I don't think that was really material. Can you add any color about whether there was anything unusual? Did you pull forward deals and hence you think next quarter is going to be seasonally weaker than usual? But again, there was an enormous differentiation relative to normal history in your own guidance. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes, Marie, you want to take that?\nMarie Myers: [Why don't I just] (ph) address Hybrid Cloud, Toni. Look, first of all, I'd start out and say, look, we're really pleased with the performance of Hybrid Cloud in the quarter. And as you mentioned, revenue was up almost 18% year-on-year and 22% quarter-on-quarter, so really strong growth. It was really driven by both Private Cloud and frankly just the ongoing adoption of HPE Alletra MP Storage. So I think both of those were just great drivers of contribution. I think you see in the deck that -- on the investor deck, we had 39,000 customers on GreenLake. And our MP Storage, I think, is one of the fastest adoptions ever in the history of the company. So I think you're starting to see those benefits pass-through. And in fact, [AAR] (ph) was up 48% as well. So overall, really good on the top-line, and frankly, pleased with the trajectory from a margin perspective as well, as you rightly said, we're continuing to scale the business, manage our cost structure all of that's paying off. And the Q1 guide actually does continue some of the momentum on the margin. We expect that to be relatively sequentially flattish. And given the strong Q4, we do expect to have a modest sort of decrease in revenue which is more in-line with the sequential on Hybrid Cloud. So overall I think very pleased and want that trajectory to continue, Toni. I'll turn it over to Antonio now.\nAntonio Neri: Just to add a couple of things there, Toni, and before I answer the AI question. So first of all, we now see the result of many, many quarters of hard work in Hybrid Cloud. Remember, Hybrid Cloud is led by the GreenLake platform plus storage plus all the ancillary services. And Alletra MP Storage today is the fastest-ever follow ramp in the history of the company, already on a $1 billion annualized basis. And remember, that platform actually could be higher. But remember, a portion of that revenue gets deferred because it's a subscription of the software to the infrastructure. And that's why I'm so excited with the focus of the platform, including the latest introduction with the Storage MP X 10000 because that addresses the AI needs at scale, particularly exabyte scale for unstructured data. The second thing is I'm really proud, and by the way, on Alletra MP, we sold already 3,000 new systems. On the GreenLake obviously, the platform has 39,000 customers. Throughout the year, we added more than 9,000 new logos to HPE. And now with Morpheus Data and OpsRamp, Zerto on the ransomware protection plus the GreenOps, the FinOps, people realize that GreenLake is a true hybrid by design and is core how we deliver infrastructure and the software that comes with it. So that's what's driving the growth in the Hybrid Cloud space. And more to come there because also Aruba has a huge component of subscription through the GreenLake platform. And then on the AI, yes, the pipeline grew quarter-over-quarter. And as I said, it's a multiple of the current backlog at more than $3.5 billion, but also the composition of the pipeline keeps shifting. And my -- what I'm really pleased is that the enterprise side has grown very rapidly on the back of the offer that now it's available for ordering for customers.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you Toni. Next question please.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. If I can change gears here a bit on Intelligent Edge. You talked about the strong order patterns. But when I look at the revenue performance in the quarter, I know you were up modestly, but it did seem like overall from at least relative to some other peers that have reported, the sequential growth was a bit more limited relative to sort of quarter-over-quarter increases here. So I mean, is there -- how you are thinking about sort of the next year playing out? And when you look at [auto] (ph) trends, are they coming in as expected? Or are you seeing a bit more weakness than what you would have expected maybe 90 days ago? And within that portfolio, how are you thinking about where, as you said, enterprises are going to spend more relative to their IT budgets? What are you hearing from them in terms of priorities within that portfolio? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Absolutely, and thank you for the question. So as I said in my remarks, we had the third consecutive order growth in Intelligent Edge. But you don't see yet fully translating into revenue, which looks like more flattish. In fact, that's the case for even Q1 is because the growth areas that accelerated are very much subscription based. So this is SD-WAN with SSE, called the SASE framework, had a very nice quarter. The second is the subscription services to HPE GreenLake Aruba Central, which is very important in the way you manage that infrastructure. But we are now seeing is also customers placing orders for future quarters related to Wi-Fi 7. And as we look at that, what I'm very excited is that when you upgrade your access points at some point, you also need to upgrade your campus switching. And the reason why it is necessary because the access points are powered over Ethernet from the switching port. But today, I will say, the one area has not yet fully returned to what we want to see is the campus switching itself. And then last but not least, data center networking using more intelligent features that our CNX platform brings to table has had double-digit growth again. And so that's why I'm excited about the combination with Juniper Networks because bring complementarity to that portfolio. And when I look at the AI, I see three unique opportunities. Number one, the interconnectivity within data center to data center. That requires basically a big router. And obviously Juniper really has a leading platform with 100-gig. Once you are inside the data center, you need a high performance fabric. You need to let the pipes inside the data center to be able to connect rack to rack and row to row. And then inside the rack itself, you need a high-performance connectivity. This is why the HPE Slingshot 400-gig that we just announced two weeks ago has played a massive role, especially as customers will consider other type of silicon in that environment. And they need an open architecture and that's what HPE Slingshot brings on. But I believe the market is on recovery, 3 data points already, three quarters of growth. And this is what I believe in the context what Marie just said early on, on the question of margins and contribution of each of the businesses, I argued networking is the biggest upside HPE will have in '25 and '26.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you Samik. Next question please.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great, guys. Thank you for the [technical difficulty]. Antonio, can you dig in a little bit into the de-platforming of the orders? You mentioned risk, but can you get into specifics in terms of what was the definition of risk? And how do you think about AI orders going forward? I know it's lumpy but just trying to get a sense for what was particularly risky about that orders. And how should we think about that going forward? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: I mean, listen, we look at the customers from a variety of angles. Obviously, the ability to verify end user, ability to obviously fulfill the payment of the orders and risk associated with allocated components and the like. And we felt that particular order had a lot of risk and we decided not to fulfill it because of our stringent controls. And my view is that this was the right thing to do.\nMarie Myers: Yes. And I'd just add, look, HPE has a very strong control environment. As we've said before, orders and backlog are subject to the booking pushouts and cancellations prior to rev rec. So we maintain those tight controls.\nPaul Glaser: Okay, thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question today will come from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. You sounded fairly constructive around IT spend, particularly heading into '25. So I'm just wondering what's changed if anything, over the last three months mainly in terms of macro backdrop. And I guess, more specifically, have you seen any pick up or change in behavior post-election? Thanks.\nAntonio Neri: Well, first of all Matt, welcome. Welcome to the community. Pleased to have you here. So the macro environment versus a year ago has improved, no question whatsoever. Obviously they are unique areas where the customers are paying more attention. Focus on AI clearly is very high on the agenda. Focus on implementing a more flexible hybrid model because AI at the core is a hybrid workload and a data-intensive workload. Definitely, that's another big area. And both of those spaces, HPE has the right to play and win with a unique focus and innovation. I think obviously, cyber continues to be very important. But then also by geography, maybe varies a little bit. But as I said earlier, in server, we are on the cycle for modernization and improve efficiency of footprint cost per workload. I talked about the TCO per workload and as well as the power consumption. A lot of focus on sustainability. This was very obvious to me, Matt, when I was two weeks ago in Barcelona. We had the biggest conference ever in Europe with more than 4,500 customers all very keen to understand our solutions in the context of sustainability. And then one of the areas, again, I will reinforce what I said earlier networking needs to catch up to the demands of AI. And that's why we believe that the combination of HPE and Juniper is so important to drive that next wave of innovation. But networking clearly is going to be a topic for 2025 and beyond. So that's what we see. When I speak to customers, which I do more than 50% of the time the AI is pretty much focused on the enterprise side. It is very much focused about business productivity and time to value. And even in our case right, we have many, many, many use cases, which many are already deployed in production, which allows us to do some of the things that Marie talked early on in efficiency and cost reduction. But we're still early and that's the excitement, which means the opportunities are yet to come at much bigger scale. And if I want to wrap my commentary about why we are delivering the performance we have delivered in Q4, I will use only one word, innovation. Our strategy is an innovation-driven strategy that makes us more relevant, that eventually customers buy more from us, that increases value for shareholders. So for me, it's a testament that the strategy is working. And then as I look at these mega trends and the customer needs, we are uniquely positioned even with the pending Juniper acquisition to address those needs.\nPaul Glaser: Okay. Thank you. Operator, one more question, please.\nOperator: Of course. And your final question today will come from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. The enterprise services on the AI side of things, it looks like you continue to book services there on your orders. If you can double click on that, relative to where you were last quarter, what kind of services? Is that a growing percentage of your orders revenues? And where is HPE winning as you look at those services pipeline as well? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Thank you for the question. Our services orders related to AI went up quarter-over-quarter. So -- and the type of services customers are looking for is you can use two different ways to think about it, the day 0, day 1, and day 2. The day 0 is where you help customers define the use cases, define the return on investment and the like. The day 1 is where you design and implement, and the day 2 is to run it. And HPE is uniquely positioned in all these three days, if you will. And therefore, we see quite a bit of engagement upfront. But also the partnerships with companies like Deloitte, and I mentioned that are so important to reach customers, to bring more a business process-oriented approach is essential. They also focus on additional AI practices. And we have many other conversations, by the way. You will hear more about that in the next few weeks, few announcements there. And then obviously, on design and implementing and running, HPE has all the capabilities that we need. But on the designing and implementing, this unique approach with the Private Cloud AI has proven to be the right value proposition because many of these enterprises don't have the time, don't have the expertise, and they want a partner that can help them do that. And then on the runtime, many of these instances would not land in their own data center, will land into what I call co-locations. And HPE already has three disposition enterprise stacks with our Private Cloud AI so that they can turn it on when they are ready to deploy those use cases. And that's why we should expect continued improvement on the services side, which is the source for gross margin as we go forward.\nPaul Glaser: Very good. That was our last question. Antonio, if you have --.\nAntonio Neri: Well, we are right on time, and I want to thank everyone for participating today. Again, very, very pleased with our results in Q4, capping off a very strong year. You can see the momentum of revenue, operating profit dollars. We did what we said. I mean, that's fundamentally the bottom-line. And we had a record number of metrics there. But I\u2019m excited about 2025. I think we have an amazing set of assets that will continue to drive profitable growth and drive shareholder value. And the pending Juniper acquisition, as I said in my remarks, we are working through the process. We are confident this will close in the early part of 2025. And we are working very, very collaborative with the DOJ. So nothing gives me pause that would not happen. So if I don\u2019t speak to you, happy holidays to you and your family, and we\u2019ll reconvene in early 2025.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marie Myers",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio and good afternoon. We ended fiscal 2024 on solid footing and exceeded what we said we would do. We achieved record quarterly revenue, delivered solid profitability, and generated free cash flow above our guidance. We executed well in a dynamic environment, growing revenue sequentially in each segment as investments in AI are leading to infrastructure refreshes. In Q4, we also maintained disciplined cost management and improved non-GAAP operating profit. A few highlights from our 2024 results. We grew AI systems revenue more than 150% to $4.1 billion and met our server non-GAAP operating margin target. We continued our product transition within storage and ended the year with Alletra MP accounting for a meaningful portion of total storage orders. Our transition to more software defined storage will drive a greater mix of higher-margin recurring revenue over the long-term. Lastly, in Intelligent Edge, we rightsized our cost structure as we navigated a digestion period. We grew fiscal 2024 revenue 3% to $30.1 billion exceeding the high-end of the outlook range we provided in September. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.99 and free cash flow of $2.3 billion both came in above our revised outlook ranges. In total we returned $826 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Overall, our results reflect focused execution and improving demand as customers implement AI strategies. Let me dive into the details of the quarter. We delivered record quarterly revenue and our second highest non-GAAP diluted net EPS, both of which came in above the high end of guidance. Total revenue grew 15% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter to a record $8.5 billion. Growth in the quarter was led by strong conversion of AI systems backlog, refreshes in traditional compute, better than expected performance within Hybrid Cloud, and a continued recovery in networking. We are pleased to report non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.58 above the high-end of guidance despite dilution from the issuance of our convertible preferred securities in September which was not factored into our outlook. ARR grew 48% year-over-year to $1.9 billion, nearly doubling since Q1 2023 primarily driven by HPE GreenLake. We added approximately 2,000 new HPE GreenLake customers during the quarter ending the year with approximately 39,000 unique customers. I am happy to report continued demand for our differentiated AI system offerings, which resulted in strong double-digit sequential revenue growth to $1.5 billion. This record contribution from AI systems revenue, combined with lower mix of Intelligent Edge, drove gross margin down 390 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 30.9%. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 9% year-over-year, as reported and were down $5 million quarter-over-quarter, as we focus on streamlining our cost structure and are closely managing discretionary expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin was 11.1%, up 140 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. Strong profitability rolled through to free cash flow, which exceeded our expectations and totaled $1.5 billion. Fiscal 2024 free cash flow was $2.3 billion our highest ever for the full year. GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.99 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.58 were both above guidance, benefiting from better than expected OI&E and expense management. GAAP EPS benefited primarily from a lower than previously expected tax expense on our aggregated H3C dispositions. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS excludes the gain, we recognized on the partial sale of our H3C investment at $162 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and other related charges and amortization of intangibles. Now let's turn to the segment results. Our server business was a key driver of record quarterly revenue and grew double digits year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter. Server revenue achieved an all-time high of $4.7 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter with sequential growth in AI systems and traditional servers. The traditional compute business continued its momentum during the quarter and grew sequentially for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by ongoing refreshes to our Gen11 server products, which carry higher AUPs. Adoption has been strongest in North America and Europe, as customers are investing in new workloads. In the fourth quarter, Gen11 accounted for more than two-thirds of our core compute revenue and contributed to AUP growth. In AI systems, we continue to grow the business to new highs. AI systems orders during the quarter were in-line with our expectations at approximately $1.2 billion. However, we had an order [de-book] (ph) in Q4, leaving our net orders for the quarter at approximately $500 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have received orders that bring our current backlog to over $3.5 billion. As we have mentioned before, AI systems orders can be lumpy and this is an example of that. Fourth quarter server operating margin was 11.6%, up 150 basis points year-over-year and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Moving to Hybrid Cloud, we grew revenue 18% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter to $1.6 billion, materially exceeding our guidance of a slight revenue increase. Revenue growth was led by Private Cloud and the continued ramp of Alletra MP. During the quarter, we received our first orders for Private Cloud AI as we target a growing pipeline that includes corporations across verticals and regions. Interest is strong in manufacturing, education, and financial services. We have also deployed Private Cloud AI internally and are moving use cases from the public cloud due to better cost performance and compliance. In storage, we are balancing investments in owned IP products against market trends. Alletra MP remains ahead of our expectations and is the fastest ramping storage product in our company's history. Keep in mind, these sales carry a higher portion of deferred software and services revenue, which takes longer to translate to the P&L but benefits margins long-term. Hybrid Cloud operating margin was 7.7%, up 390 basis points year-over-year and up 260 basis points sequentially, predominantly due to better OpEx controls. Now on to Intelligent Edge. We believe the business remains at a path of recovery and customers have largely digested excess inventories. Total Intelligent Edge revenue was $1.1 billion, down 20% year-over-year and essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Sequentially, we saw growth in services, WLAN products and software, partially offset by declines in switching and campus. Importantly, we are seeing more large deals in our pipeline, giving us confidence that demand is improving. Keep in mind, we were still benefiting from the drawdown of networking backlog in Q1 of fiscal 2024. Operating margin of 24.4% was down 270 basis points year-over-year but up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to lower OpEx in-line with our expectations. Lastly, Financial Services. Our Financial Services business generated $893 million of revenue, up 2% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Financing volumes increased 41% year-over-year to a new all-time high of $2.1 billion. Our Q4 loss ratio remained steady near 0.5% and return on equity totaled 17%. Operating margin was 9.2%, up 120 basis points year-over-year and up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Moving to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated strong operating cash flow of $2 billion and free cash flow of $1.5 billion in the quarter, both of which exceeded our expectations due to higher revenue and increased collections. For the full year, free cash flow was a record $2.3 billion, above our guidance of $1.9 billion. Q4 cash conversion cycle was a negative 12 days, down 8 days from Q4 '23 and down 16 days from last quarter. Inventory ended the year at $7.8 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter due to the nature of our AI systems business. We are focused on reducing inventory during fiscal 2025 as we convert AI systems backlog and grow our storage business. During Q4, we returned $169 million via dividends and $50 million via share repurchases to common shareholders, respectively. We returned a total of $826 million during the full year. Moving to our outlook for fiscal Q1 2025. As Antonio said, we expect to close the Juniper transaction in early 2025 at which time we will provide combined company guidance for fiscal 2025. However, let me provide some high-level thoughts, as to how we are thinking about the upcoming year. Overall customer conversations indicate higher IT spending in 2025 with multiple tailwinds that should contribute to revenue growth. We expect continued recovery in traditional compute and growing adoption of AI systems by enterprises and sovereigns, although we expect orders to remain competitive and lumpy. In Hybrid Cloud, we are beginning to see customers accelerate digital transformation projects in order to execute on AI strategies. And in networking, we expect demand will modestly recover throughout the year. For the first quarter we expect year-over-year revenue growth to be in the mid-teens. On a sequential basis, this is in-line with normal seasonality. We expect server revenue to be down quarter-over-quarter. We expect flat to modest growth sequentially in traditional compute and lower AI systems contribution following a very strong quarter. Server operating margin will be closer to 10% to 11%, as customers navigate the transition to next-gen GPUs. In Hybrid Cloud, we expect a sequential decline in the first quarter due to stronger than seasonal growth in Q4, with operating margin in the mid-single-digit range. And in networking, we are still managing prolonged sales cycles and expect the business to be around historical seasonality of flattish sequential growth. We expect Intelligent Edge operating margin to be in the low 20% range due to mix. Gross margin will benefit from a more favorable revenue mix, and we expect a modest sequential decrease in OpEx. OI&E is expected to positively contribute to the bottom-line with higher net interest income more than offsetting $0.02 of headwinds associated with the cost of our Juniper Financing. Overall, we estimate Q1 GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.31 and $0.36 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.47 and $0.52 based on 1.4 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding, including $76 million of dilution from our convertible preferred securities. For free cash flow, we typically consume cash in the first quarter. We intend to procure components needed to meet current and future AI systems demand, while continuing to manage inventory. For Q1, we intend to buy back shares of common stock at a similar pace to Q4. We remain committed in the long-term to our balanced capital allocation framework, our dividend, and our investment-grade rating. In summary, we delivered strong Q4 results and ended fiscal 2025, well positioned to drive profitable growth and generate free cash flow that we can reinvest into the business while also returning capital to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over for Q&A. Hi, Meta, good afternoon. It's Marie. And first of all, I'll just add up by saying, as you know, we typically don't get into gross margin at the segment level, but let me give you some color around how we think about our op margins. First of all, I'd say look, from a service segment perspective, really pleased with the performance in the quarter. We were at 11.6%. And if you think about it, we actually had our highest ever AI server revenue of $1.5 billion. So I think you can see just the performance there. In terms of the color and how to think about it, El Capitan actually was included in the quarter so we did actually get the final acceptances. A couple of points to note. If you look at the mix inside server, we see traditional compute particularly Gen11, we're about two-thirds of the mix so far to-date, and that particularly has higher configurations. And as a result, it is driving richer AUPs and obviously higher structural margins. And also, frankly, we've been really successful about passing over commodity costs. And if you look at both the GPU servers, it is competitive but you can see the revenue scale is helping us out there. And then finally, I think we've been really prudent with our cost controls and all of that's playing off in terms of our OpEx discipline. So that's how we're thinking about server margins. Yes. And Tim, just to add on how we think about margin structure and AI systems, I think we've said this in the past, but look we have a framework that we use for our pricing, and it's absolutely our intention to remain disciplined both on cost and price as we pursue profitable growth. I think that has been our mantra. But obviously then, we're out there balancing those gross margin pressures with cost control, strategic buys, and you've seen that in terms of our pricing discipline. And I would add -- and I think Antonio made this comment earlier that we do see over time, improving profitability as the market moves more to, I think, the two sectors that Antonio referred to, both in terms of sovereign and enterprise where we see services attach, et cetera. So just use that as a way to think about the longer-term sort of margin structure as well. Yes, no worries Amit. Good afternoon. It's Marie. So why don't I take that one? On gross margin, so for Q4, as you rightly said, it was 30.9% so we're down both on a year-on-year and Q-on-Q basis. If you step back and look at the overall revenue mix, perhaps one of the largest drivers is really just the lower contribution of the Intelligent Edge revenue. And in fact, in Q4, Amit, it was actually the lowest for the entire year. And obviously, we had a higher contribution inside of servers of AI systems revenue and product mix. So that obviously impacted gross margin. But what I would say is despite that headwind, we actually grew gross profit dollars both year-on-year and Q-on-Q. Now going forward, I think I said in my prepared remarks that we do actually expect to see gross margin will be up modestly in terms of the improved business mix and predominantly, that's driven by the Intelligent Edge mix. But from a longer-term perspective, just two things to keep in mind. First of all obviously, when we closed Juniper, that is going to be a big driver and has a very positive impact on both gross and operating. We expect that 50% of operating profit going forward will come from Juniper. And secondly as I mentioned earlier I think when I answered Tim's question, we do expect, particularly in the AI space, those higher margin opportunities as we move more into seeing the adoption of sovereign and enterprise. On the cost side of the house, really pleased with the work we've done so far to-date. We've been really focused on discretionary costs throughout '24. We're moving more into areas of productivity. Amit, as we look at '25, we are actually using GenAI inside the company, using it in finance to help drive productivity. So we see opportunities like that throughout the company. I would just say at a company as large as HPE, there's plenty of opportunity, Amit. Yes. So this is Marie here, Simon. So yes, you did get that correct in terms of servers. And I think I did mention in my prepared remarks that we did see a lower AI mix in terms of server systems in Q1. And I think as we've said in the past, this business is lumpy so you just bear that in mind as you think about it. In terms of traditional servers and the outlook on the business, really nothing's changed. We continue to see the momentum in that business. I think Antonio described it very well earlier when he mentioned two-thirds of the mix is already at Gen11 in traditional servers, and we see that continuing. So don't expect that to change fundamentally. But just remember, it's a pretty competitive environment out there, both for both traditional servers and AI systems right now in the market. So that's the way I'd sort of think about it. So that's why we felt it was prudent, given the current backlog we've got to guide 10% to 11% right now. [Why don't I just] (ph) address Hybrid Cloud, Toni. Look, first of all, I'd start out and say, look, we're really pleased with the performance of Hybrid Cloud in the quarter. And as you mentioned, revenue was up almost 18% year-on-year and 22% quarter-on-quarter, so really strong growth. It was really driven by both Private Cloud and frankly just the ongoing adoption of HPE Alletra MP Storage. So I think both of those were just great drivers of contribution. I think you see in the deck that -- on the investor deck, we had 39,000 customers on GreenLake. And our MP Storage, I think, is one of the fastest adoptions ever in the history of the company. So I think you're starting to see those benefits pass-through. And in fact, [AAR] (ph) was up 48% as well. So overall, really good on the top-line, and frankly, pleased with the trajectory from a margin perspective as well, as you rightly said, we're continuing to scale the business, manage our cost structure all of that's paying off. And the Q1 guide actually does continue some of the momentum on the margin. We expect that to be relatively sequentially flattish. And given the strong Q4, we do expect to have a modest sort of decrease in revenue which is more in-line with the sequential on Hybrid Cloud. So overall I think very pleased and want that trajectory to continue, Toni. I'll turn it over to Antonio now. Yes. And I'd just add, look, HPE has a very strong control environment. As we've said before, orders and backlog are subject to the booking pushouts and cancellations prior to rev rec. So we maintain those tight controls."

            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today. Before I share my comments on our quarterly and yearly performance, I would like to provide an update on the Juniper Network's acquisition. We have received approvals from key geographies around the world, including the European Union, UK, India, South Korea and Australia, which have given unconditional clearance and see the competitive benefits of the transaction. In the United States, we are engaged with the Department of Justice, and we expect the review will continue in the coming into the new calendar year. We anticipate the deal will close in the early part of 2025, within the previously stated timeframe. Both HPE and Juniper continue to believe the transaction will enable us to provide a complete portfolio of modern, secure networking solutions that offer essential foundations for both Hybrid Cloud and AI. The combined companies' enhanced ability to compete and innovate will fundamentally improve the networking industry. This transaction will also strengthen U.S. National Security interests by advancing HPE's position as a strong U.S. Innovator among global technology companies. Turning to results, we had an exceptional fourth quarter to cap off a strong year. In actual dollar terms, we generate a record quarterly revenue of $8.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year, exceeding $8 billion for the first time in our history. Our results reflect the continued adoption of HPE GreenLake and the acceleration of our revenue growth in AI. Q4 and fiscal year 2024 results exceeded our expectations for revenue, dilute and net earnings per share and free cash flow. We draw sequential revenue growth across each of our segments, a continuation of the positive momentum we saw build throughout the year across our business. Q4 constituted our third consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year growth rates and revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Contributed significantly to our performance was record server revenue of $4.7 billion, up 31% year-over-year, a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Sequentially, AI systems revenue was up 16% to $1.5 billion, exiting fiscal year 2024 with $6.7 billion in cumulative orders since Q1 of fiscal year 2023. After the close of Q4, I am pleased to share that our AI systems demand remains strong. We have received new orders bringing AI systems backlog to over $3.5 billion. Our traditional server business also continues to reflect the [improvement market dynamics] (ph) as we draw our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit orders growth. Hybrid cloud revenue grew 18% year-over-year and 21% sequentially, resulting in revenue of $1.6 billion, with increasing revenue for HPE Private Cloud and continued growth in HPE Storage. We are seeing customers like Lupin Limited, a large India pharmaceutical company, repatriate workloads from the public cloud to enhance their data security amid regulatory and compliance requirements. Customer adoption of our HPE Alletra Storage MP solutions continues to rise at an accelerated pace. Since launch, we have sold approximately 3,000 systems. Miami-Dade County, the seventh most populous county in the United States, implemented HPE Alletra Storage MP to consolidate an existing storage footprint to lower TCO and improve performance and sustainability. Our Intelligent Edge business achieved its third consecutive quarter of orders growth, reflecting our expectations for an improving demand environment. We are particularly pleased with the double-digit year-over-year orders growth that we saw in data center networking, an important growth market for our HPE Aruba Networking business. HPE financial services financing volumes of $2.1 billion rose to an all-time high this quarter, driven by strong demand for HPE GreenLake and AI Financing. It is clear customers need more investment capacity whether to deploy AI or to accelerate the adoption of [Hybrid Cloud] (ph). Our record-breaking revenue performance in Q4 resulted in record profitability with non-GAAP operating profit of $938 million. That translated to non-GAAP operating margin of more than 11%, a 110 basis points increase sequentially. As a result of our exceptional Q4 performance, fiscal year 2024 revenue growth topped 3% year-over-year, exceeding $30 billion as we added more than 9,000 new customers across the portfolio. Combined with our discipline operating expense management, which accelerated in the back-half of the year, we generated a record-breaking $2.3 billion in free cash flow, exceeding our guidance of at least $1.9 billion for the year. We closed the year on a strong note, exceeding our full year commitments for revenue, diluted net earnings per share, and free cash flow. We are very pleased with our results and excited about the opportunities ahead for HPE. It is clear our strategy is working. We have a tremendous set of assets, including extensive solutions from-edge to-cloud, enabling us to meet our customer needs across AI, networking, and hybrid cloud. Providing a full stack of product and services clearly differentiates us versus our competition and accelerates value for our shareholders. In Q4, we continue our investment in innovation, which further enhances our product portfolio and positions us to capture additional market share. AI is clearly transformative for our customers, and HPE is positioned to lead in the next wave of innovation. At our recent AI day, we announced the industry-first, 100% fanless direct liquid cooling architecture, a critical capability for customers to leverage the next generation of direct liquid cooled GPUs and CPUs, while facilitating peak performance as they manage increased energy densities. This industry-first architecture is unique to HPE and results from decades of experience in liquid cooling technologies. Two weeks ago, at SC24, we announced our newest 400 gigabits HPE Slingshot Direct Liquid Cool networking fabric of products, engineered to support both generative AI cluster workloads and exascale supercomputing. These innovations are enhancing the performance of our AI systems and supercomputing product lines, differentiating us from the competition. At SC24, we also announced that HPE has delivered the fastest verified supercomputer in the world to the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. El Capitan is not only the world's fastest supercomputer at more than 1.7 exaflop, it is also among the most energy efficient in the world. HPE now has deployed seven of the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, including numbers one, two, and three on the list. We also continue to innovate to help accelerate enterprise adoption of AI. Since launching HPE Private Cloud AI, we have expanded our collaboration with Deloitte to help businesses of all sizes to deploy AI solutions tailored for their industry-specific use cases such as C-suite AI and many others. In addition, we introduced the Unleash AI Partner Program to grow our ecosystem and expand customers' ability to address their AI use cases with HPE Private Cloud AI. While we are still in early days, interest is strong with hundreds of customers in the pipeline, with many compelling proof-of-concept underway. We closed our first deals during Q4, including RWE, a leading company in the field of renewable energy, which selected HPE Private Cloud AI to unlock insights from weather data. Customers are also asking us to help them simplify their VMware private clouds and optimize their virtualization costs. At HPE Discover Barcelona 2 weeks ago, we launched HPE VM Essentials, which enables customers to manage their virtualization states across HPE VMware and many others. We have built on our recent acquisitions of Morpheus Data and OpsRamp, giving customers operational flexibility and allowing them to no longer be locked into a single virtualization vendor. With HPE VM Essentials, they can achieve up to 5 times lower TCO. As a part of our HPE VM Essentials, we also provide an enterprise-grade open-source KVM virtualization solution. This allows customers to dramatically reduce costs, while increasing their flexibility to innovate across a full suite of hybrid cloud operations capabilities in an on-premises multi-stack and a multi-cloud public environment. In storage, we continue to invest in our multi-protocol HPE Alletra Storage MP platform as we transition our storage portfolio to an AI-driven, cloud-native, and disaggregated architecture. Our new HPE Alletra Storage MP X 10000 is a revolutionary new high-performance object storage designed for AI exabyte scale and optimized for high-speed unstructured data lakes with [rapid] (ph) restore for backup and recovery. Our AWS S3 compatible object storage interface and deduplication, supports up to 20 times data reduction and streamlines integration with any available backup solution in the market. With HPE Alletra Storage MP X 10000, customers can achieve up to 6 times faster object storage performance compared to competitor solutions in the market. Finally, our Innovation Intelligent Edge are helping us to advance HPE Aruba Networking Central with AIOps copilot capabilities built into our HPE GreenLake cloud. During the quarter, we announced two new solutions to enhance the networking operators experience and security for our customers. The first is the integration with HPE OpsRamp to monitor third-party devices. We also introduced a behavioral analytical-based network detection and response capability, where we are leveraging network and telemetry to train AI models to monitor customer IoT devices. We have an important place in the market, as a leading technology innovator. I am proud that HPE team members around the globe, bring our innovations to customers every day to help them modernize their IT infrastructure and transform for the better. I am very pleased with our exceptional fourth quarter results and the resulting outperformance in several of our full year commitments to our shareholders. Our strategy is well aligned to the mega trends reshaping networking, hybrid cloud, and AI, and our unique product portfolio is well-positioned to capture new customers and accelerate value for our shareholders. We expect the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks to further enhance our portfolio providing customers with complete edge-to-cloud solutions. I am extremely excited about the significant opportunity we have in the coming fiscal year to drive increased value for our shareholders. I am optimistic about what we can achieve and look forward to the year ahead. Now let me turn the call over to Marie, who will provide more details about our Q4 results and guide for the first quarter. Marie? Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. This is Antonio. And good afternoon. The pipeline is a multiple of the current backlog which we shared as of a day ago, which is basically more than $3.5 billion. And inside our pipeline, obviously remember there is four key segments of the market. Obviously, the biggest driver continues to be what I call segment one or model builders, hyperscalers as well as now the Tier 2, Tier 3 that they are in the business to provide GPU capacity on demand on a per hour basis. So they continue to be the two biggest driver. But what I'm really pleased, and Maria and I have made those comments in our remarks, is the fact that we see now the enterprise AI pipeline continue to grow steadily. There are hundreds of customers on that pipeline. The size of the deal will vary obviously because it's not the same size of the deal of the other two segments. But there are some very interesting large-sized deals in the pipeline, and they are doing proof-of-concept. But the positive news is that, remember that we made the announcement of the offer that co-engineered solution with NVIDIA in June, and we made it available only on September 9. So really, we had 7 weeks to be able to collect orders. We already collected orders in enterprise AI and we already closed deals in enterprise AI. And two weeks ago, we made additional enhancement to the offer, particularly with a partner ecosystem, including Deloitte. So very pleased. This is going to be a growth driver in 2025, as we go forward. And then on the first [segment] (ph), obviously, the transition, I would say, to the latest GPUs that will happen over the course of the next few quarters. But in addition to what Marie said Meta, is this was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year orders growth in the traditional server. And when I think about the opportunity ahead of us, there are just for HPE, 0.5 million units in the installed base that must be refreshed for several reasons number one, they are doing very little work and consuming a lot of energy. Number two is because they have reaching or they are reaching the depreciation cycle. And when enterprise customers think about deployment of AI, they need to free up space, power and cooling to absorb this new system. So this is a big opportunity for us, both from a units perspective and obviously Gen11 comes with a different configuration, as Marie said, and then the services touch that comes with it. Sure, and thank you for the question. As we said before, orders during the quarter were in-line with our expectations. In fact, we booked $1.2 billion of new orders in Q4. However, we de-booked a large order, which was $700 million during the same quarter because we had concern with a specific customer. And we proud ourselves of a very strong control of this environment, and we continue to be very vigilant about how we engage and making sure we manage the risk. And we felt that already carried a lot of risk, and therefore we felt it was very prudent to de-book it and focus on other areas of the business. And that's why as we keep going throughout the next few weeks, up to yesterday, we ended up with a backlog now which is more over the $3.5 billion. So that's what happened. It has nothing to do with competitive. It has nothing to do with everything else. We had a concern with a specific customer, and we decided it was prudent to de-book it. Also, Simon obviously, in addition to the traditional yearly seasonality, now we have gone back to the normal seasonality we used to have a few years ago when [we had just] (ph) for the COVID and the recovery that happened after that. On the AI side, one-third -- more than one-third of our backlog is Blackwell-related. And so you need to consider that -- the trajectory of that more than $3.5 billion being Blackwell-related. You need time to convert that into revenue. And that's why Marie mentioned the lumpiness of revenue conversion sometime or the orders intake. But notwithstanding, we are very pleased with the revenue we had in Q4. We are confident about the continued growth in 2025, as we transition the GPUs to this new type of silicon. Yes. I think you're right, Aaron. I think again, in the segmentation, I'd like to operate within the segment 1 and 2, call it, service provider, hyperscalers, and model builders. They tend to lead with the latest technology, and that transition is going to happen over '25. And so obviously, we are working with the customers and NVIDIA as they become available, and we will be shipping those in volume in 2025. And so when you think about calendar year right, I will say, in the first half of 2025 is when you start seeing growth in that platform. In the sovereign space, I don't think that's the case. I think it's a mix of multiple configurations because they are different type of workloads. And then in enterprise I argue, it will be an N minus 1 or 2, because the enterprise is less about Blackwell or Grace Blackwell. It's more about the simplicity of the deployment and the time to value. And that's why when you look at today, our HPE Private Cloud AI is all now based on H100. And so -- and that's plenty for what they do, whether it's dragging a model or fine-tuning a model or doing inferencing. So that's why you can generalize things here, but it is fair to say people in the business to build and train models will lead with the latest technology and they will transition in the first half of 2025. And then the enterprise will stay 1 or 2 generations behind because obviously, they'll need all that computing power. Yes, Marie, you want to take that? Just to add a couple of things there, Toni, and before I answer the AI question. So first of all, we now see the result of many, many quarters of hard work in Hybrid Cloud. Remember, Hybrid Cloud is led by the GreenLake platform plus storage plus all the ancillary services. And Alletra MP Storage today is the fastest-ever follow ramp in the history of the company, already on a $1 billion annualized basis. And remember, that platform actually could be higher. But remember, a portion of that revenue gets deferred because it's a subscription of the software to the infrastructure. And that's why I'm so excited with the focus of the platform, including the latest introduction with the Storage MP X 10000 because that addresses the AI needs at scale, particularly exabyte scale for unstructured data. The second thing is I'm really proud, and by the way, on Alletra MP, we sold already 3,000 new systems. On the GreenLake obviously, the platform has 39,000 customers. Throughout the year, we added more than 9,000 new logos to HPE. And now with Morpheus Data and OpsRamp, Zerto on the ransomware protection plus the GreenOps, the FinOps, people realize that GreenLake is a true hybrid by design and is core how we deliver infrastructure and the software that comes with it. So that's what's driving the growth in the Hybrid Cloud space. And more to come there because also Aruba has a huge component of subscription through the GreenLake platform. And then on the AI, yes, the pipeline grew quarter-over-quarter. And as I said, it's a multiple of the current backlog at more than $3.5 billion, but also the composition of the pipeline keeps shifting. And my -- what I'm really pleased is that the enterprise side has grown very rapidly on the back of the offer that now it's available for ordering for customers. Absolutely, and thank you for the question. So as I said in my remarks, we had the third consecutive order growth in Intelligent Edge. But you don't see yet fully translating into revenue, which looks like more flattish. In fact, that's the case for even Q1 is because the growth areas that accelerated are very much subscription based. So this is SD-WAN with SSE, called the SASE framework, had a very nice quarter. The second is the subscription services to HPE GreenLake Aruba Central, which is very important in the way you manage that infrastructure. But we are now seeing is also customers placing orders for future quarters related to Wi-Fi 7. And as we look at that, what I'm very excited is that when you upgrade your access points at some point, you also need to upgrade your campus switching. And the reason why it is necessary because the access points are powered over Ethernet from the switching port. But today, I will say, the one area has not yet fully returned to what we want to see is the campus switching itself. And then last but not least, data center networking using more intelligent features that our CNX platform brings to table has had double-digit growth again. And so that's why I'm excited about the combination with Juniper Networks because bring complementarity to that portfolio. And when I look at the AI, I see three unique opportunities. Number one, the interconnectivity within data center to data center. That requires basically a big router. And obviously Juniper really has a leading platform with 100-gig. Once you are inside the data center, you need a high performance fabric. You need to let the pipes inside the data center to be able to connect rack to rack and row to row. And then inside the rack itself, you need a high-performance connectivity. This is why the HPE Slingshot 400-gig that we just announced two weeks ago has played a massive role, especially as customers will consider other type of silicon in that environment. And they need an open architecture and that's what HPE Slingshot brings on. But I believe the market is on recovery, 3 data points already, three quarters of growth. And this is what I believe in the context what Marie just said early on, on the question of margins and contribution of each of the businesses, I argued networking is the biggest upside HPE will have in '25 and '26. I mean, listen, we look at the customers from a variety of angles. Obviously, the ability to verify end user, ability to obviously fulfill the payment of the orders and risk associated with allocated components and the like. And we felt that particular order had a lot of risk and we decided not to fulfill it because of our stringent controls. And my view is that this was the right thing to do. Well, first of all Matt, welcome. Welcome to the community. Pleased to have you here. So the macro environment versus a year ago has improved, no question whatsoever. Obviously they are unique areas where the customers are paying more attention. Focus on AI clearly is very high on the agenda. Focus on implementing a more flexible hybrid model because AI at the core is a hybrid workload and a data-intensive workload. Definitely, that's another big area. And both of those spaces, HPE has the right to play and win with a unique focus and innovation. I think obviously, cyber continues to be very important. But then also by geography, maybe varies a little bit. But as I said earlier, in server, we are on the cycle for modernization and improve efficiency of footprint cost per workload. I talked about the TCO per workload and as well as the power consumption. A lot of focus on sustainability. This was very obvious to me, Matt, when I was two weeks ago in Barcelona. We had the biggest conference ever in Europe with more than 4,500 customers all very keen to understand our solutions in the context of sustainability. And then one of the areas, again, I will reinforce what I said earlier networking needs to catch up to the demands of AI. And that's why we believe that the combination of HPE and Juniper is so important to drive that next wave of innovation. But networking clearly is going to be a topic for 2025 and beyond. So that's what we see. When I speak to customers, which I do more than 50% of the time the AI is pretty much focused on the enterprise side. It is very much focused about business productivity and time to value. And even in our case right, we have many, many, many use cases, which many are already deployed in production, which allows us to do some of the things that Marie talked early on in efficiency and cost reduction. But we're still early and that's the excitement, which means the opportunities are yet to come at much bigger scale. And if I want to wrap my commentary about why we are delivering the performance we have delivered in Q4, I will use only one word, innovation. Our strategy is an innovation-driven strategy that makes us more relevant, that eventually customers buy more from us, that increases value for shareholders. So for me, it's a testament that the strategy is working. And then as I look at these mega trends and the customer needs, we are uniquely positioned even with the pending Juniper acquisition to address those needs. Thank you for the question. Our services orders related to AI went up quarter-over-quarter. So -- and the type of services customers are looking for is you can use two different ways to think about it, the day 0, day 1, and day 2. The day 0 is where you help customers define the use cases, define the return on investment and the like. The day 1 is where you design and implement, and the day 2 is to run it. And HPE is uniquely positioned in all these three days, if you will. And therefore, we see quite a bit of engagement upfront. But also the partnerships with companies like Deloitte, and I mentioned that are so important to reach customers, to bring more a business process-oriented approach is essential. They also focus on additional AI practices. And we have many other conversations, by the way. You will hear more about that in the next few weeks, few announcements there. And then obviously, on design and implementing and running, HPE has all the capabilities that we need. But on the designing and implementing, this unique approach with the Private Cloud AI has proven to be the right value proposition because many of these enterprises don't have the time, don't have the expertise, and they want a partner that can help them do that. And then on the runtime, many of these instances would not land in their own data center, will land into what I call co-locations. And HPE already has three disposition enterprise stacks with our Private Cloud AI so that they can turn it on when they are ready to deploy those use cases. And that's why we should expect continued improvement on the services side, which is the source for gross margin as we go forward. Well, we are right on time, and I want to thank everyone for participating today. Again, very, very pleased with our results in Q4, capping off a very strong year. You can see the momentum of revenue, operating profit dollars. We did what we said. I mean, that's fundamentally the bottom-line. And we had a record number of metrics there. But I'm excited about 2025. I think we have an amazing set of assets that will continue to drive profitable growth and drive shareholder value. And the pending Juniper acquisition, as I said in my remarks, we are working through the process. We are confident this will close in the early part of 2025. And we are working very, very collaborative with the DOJ. So nothing gives me pause that would not happen. So if I don't speak to you, happy holidays to you and your family, and we'll reconvene in early 2025."

With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\nAntonio Neri: Thank you, Paul, and welcome to your new role leading investor relations at HPE. And thank you, all, for joining us today. HPE delivered a strong third quarter performance. We generated impressive revenue growth with notable acceleration of AI systems revenue conversion, as well as higher operating margin from the prior quarter. Net revenue was $7.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share rose $0.01 from a year ago to $0.50 in Q3, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance. We generated a free cash flow of more than $660 million, and will pay a dividend of $0.30 per share. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. Marie will provide further details in her remarks. Lastly, we are also pleased to have received the first payment of $2.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of part of our equity position in H3C. Overall, the demand environment this quarter has improved. We saw sequential and year-over-year orders growth, but with some geographic variation. Demand was strong in North America, Asia-Pacific, Japan and India, while Europe and the Middle East lagged. We are aggressively going after the opportunities presented by better market conditions and are well-positioned in a competitive and dynamic environment as we close our fiscal year. I am very proud of the progress we have made in delivering on our edge-to-cloud vision over the last several years, which is generating this performance momentum. We have accelerated innovation across all pillars of our strategy. Networking, hybrid cloud, and AI delivered through a unified cloud-native and AI-driven experience as a part of our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Today, almost 37,000 unique customers use our HPE GreenLake cloud to manage their hybrid IT estate, which drives our annualized revenue run rate subscription growth. In Intelligent Edge, we have invested in building an industry-leading AI-driven networking portfolio. HPE Aruba Networking is a recognized market leader in the campus and branch segment. The AI market requires a modern, high-performing networking fabric as a core foundation to deliver a more efficient data center cloud infrastructure as the world transitions to accelerated computing. We are excited to significantly expand our networking business with the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks. The acquisition of this high-margin business will accelerate our edge-to-cloud vision with a full networking IP stack, from silicon to infrastructure, to the operating system, to security, to software and services in a cloud-native and AI-driven approach. We expect our compelling value proposition will begin to deliver returns to our shareholders in the year post close. In Hybrid Cloud, we redefine the cloud space by delivering an experience that is hybrid by design, with HPE GreenLake at the core of our strategy. We have transitioned our HPE server and HPE storage products to cloud-native and software-defined solutions while adding unique software and services to our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Our innovation gives customer choice and flexibility across all workload types, while managing their public on-prem colos and edges in one unified hybrid cloud operations experience. Our AI business is built on decades of large-scale infrastructure expertise, including technologies like direct liquid cooling that they're powering our largest AI systems for large language model builders, service providers, and supercomputing users. We have rapidly expanded our AI portfolio, including the introduction of HPE Private Cloud AI, specifically engineered for enterprise customers, with the expectation of significant market expansion as we are still in the early stages of adoption. Pursuing this strategy has diversified the HPE portfolio to parts of the market with higher margins. Our differentiation not only makes us highly relevant to customers and partners, but also drives profitable growth for our shareholders. I have a few observations about Q3 performance in our key segments that I will share, and then I will let Marie fully review more detailed results. Our Server segment, again, outperformed expectations in Q3, thanks to an acceleration in converting AI system orders to revenue. We converted about $1.3 billion in AI systems revenue this quarter, a 39% increase from Q2. Revenue from our traditional server business also climbed with a double-digit increase in product orders, both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting an improvement in the market for traditional compute. We continue to pursue profitable deals within our target server margin range, underscoring stability in our operating profit profile. In AI, our momentum is very clear. Customer demand for HPE AI systems rose sequentially, with opportunities increasing in both enterprise and sovereign AI clouds as customers explore more use cases. AI system orders climbed $1.6 billion in the quarter to a cumulative $6.2 billion since Q1 2023, an increase of approximately $3.5 billion over the last year. Customers are exploring new ways to use AI, adding to our already robust pipeline and creating even more runway for our broad AI offerings. Enterprise interest in generative AI is high, and while adoption is still in the initial stages, it is accelerating. Customers tell us that they see the possibilities and are building the business cases. We see use cases across multiple verticals, from healthcare to financial services to manufacturing. As the use cases mature, they need expertise to help guide the implementation across their enterprise business, not just IT. Direct liquid cooling continues to be a key differentiator and demand driver with large-scale AI customers. The expertise in IP required to build and run large direct liquid cooled systems creates a significant margin rich services opportunity for day zero, day one, and day two operations. HPE has one of the largest water cooling manufacturing and services footprint in the world. In the sovereign space, just recently, the U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory announced that its HPE-built Kestrel supercomputer came fully online over the summer. Kestrel will be five times more powerful than NREL's previous supercomputer, Eagle, and is 100% direct liquid cooled. This system will enable research advancing energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, renewable energy, and energy system integration, including by leveraging the latest innovation in AI large language model, modeling, and simulation. You saw at HPE Discover that HPE is deepening our strong partnership with NVIDIA. In June, we jointly announced NVIDIA AI Computing by HPE, a portfolio of codeveloped AI solutions and joint go-to-market integrations that enable enterprises to accelerate adoption of generative AI. One of those solutions, HPE Private Cloud AI, which just became generally available yesterday, is a turnkey solution that makes it easy for enterprises of all sizes to gain an energy-efficient, fast and flexible option for sustainably developing and deploying generative AI applications. To this adoption, HPE Private Cloud AI will be available in four modular configurations. These start with small-for-small model inferencing needs on NVIDIA L40 and scale up to extra large on NVIDIA Grace Hopper 200s for a configuration that allows for multiple use cases, running inferencing retrieval, augmentation generation, and large language model fine-tuning. We are offering customers two important choice points: self-managed or fully-managed service, with the ability to purchase as-a-service through an operating expenditure model or as a capital expense. With three clicks and less than 30 seconds to deploy, HPE Private Cloud AI dramatically simplifies DevOps, ITOps and FinOps for enterprise customers, allowing them to easily establish and meter their environments, monitor and observe their infrastructure and applications, and lifecycle manage all aspects of their private cloud AI system. And just last week, we further expanded our NVIDIA partnership by adding NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints to HPE Private Cloud AI for multiple generative AI use cases. This includes a digital human workflow for customer service, a generative virtual screening workflow for computer-aided drug discovery, and a PDF data extraction workflow for enterprise RAG that uses vast quantity of business data for more accurate responses. Integrating this catalog of pretrained, customizable AI workflows into our HPE Private Cloud AI stack enables customers to easily deploy key AI use cases to accelerate time to value. With a series of announcements about HPE Private Cloud AI, we are well-positioned to serve our enterprise customer needs. Since the announcement less than three months ago, we have seen very high customer interest, with requests for proof of concept demos exceeding our expectations. We are increasing sales resources and enabling our partner ecosystem to meet the high demands for demos. We believe HPE Private Cloud AI is going to be an important growth driver for our hybrid cloud business, and we are filing numerous patents to ensure our leadership is recognized and protected. This innovation and customer interest positions HPE Hybrid Cloud well, as AI is an accelerator for hybrid cloud solutions. We are on a positive trajectory with orders and we are beginning to realize returns from an ongoing investment in both our product portfolio and our specialized sales motions. There is more work to do, but we are pleased that our revenue and profitability both improved quarter-over-quarter. Customers require new data protocols in file and object to store and manage data to train AI applications. We expect that extending our HPE Alletra Storage software-defined offerings to these new data protocols will lead to a higher proportional software and related services in our portfolio. We are seeing double-digits orders growth in HPE Alletra Storage and in HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud SaaS offerings. In just the last three months, almost 3,000 new customers began using our HPE GreenLake cloud, and we added almost 10,000 more customers in the last year. We are pleased with the momentum we are seeing with customers who have turned into HPE GreenLake. We are proud to announce a new agreement with Deloitte to utilize the HPE GreenLake cloud to help transform and centralize Deloitte's IT infrastructure, which includes AI computing. We continue to introduce new hybrid cloud offerings by adding more profitable software and services, which is clearly reflected in our ARR mix now at 71%. For example, at the end of August, we closed our acquisition of Morpheus Data. We believe this acquisition solidifies HPE's leadership position as the first vendor with a full suite of software capabilities across the hybrid cloud stack. We look forward to integrating Morpheus Data multi-cloud automation and orchestration capabilities into our HPE GreenLake cloud platform to complement the AI-driven multi-cloud and multi-vendor observability from HPE's OpsRamp acquisition and our own organic innovation. In Intelligent Edge, we believe we are beginning a market recovery as customers finished digesting previous orders post-COVID. Revenue improved sequentially on gains in services and SASE. Momentum is building and we saw sequential orders increase in all regions with particular strength in North America. On the products front, orders growth was led by wireless LAN, SASE, and data center networking products. Conversely, campus-switching products orders have been slower to recover. Last month, we reinforced HPE Aruba Networking cyber defenses with the new AI-powered network detection and response and campus-based zero trust network access. The solution leverages telemetry from HPE Aruba Networking Central's data lake to train and deploy AI models to monitor and detect unusual activity in vulnerable IoT devices, helping to support mission-critical business processes. Our security solutions are attracted to customers like Nobu Hotels, which is leveraging a secure AI power network combining the HPE Aruba Networking Central platform and HPE Aruba Networking ClearPass to implement a zero trust strategy. This installation will help provide secure, seamless and hyper-personalized guest experiences, including an AI concierge across Nobu's global footprint on luxury hotels. We are excited for what comes next with our pending Juniper Networks acquisition and the comprehensive networking profile we will create. As I have said before, we expect that Juniper will be accretive to our margin profile and non-GAAP EPS in year one. The deal recently received regulatory approvals in the European Union, UK, India, and several other jurisdictions and we remain on track to close in late calendar year 2024 or early calendar year 2025. Plans are well underway to ensure successful integration post close. To conclude, I am very pleased with our third quarter performance. Our impressive revenue growth reflects the strength of our portfolio and the growing excitement customers have for our newest innovations across AI, network and hybrid cloud. HPE is playing a crucial role in helping customers adopt this transformative technology across their business. As we innovate, we also continue to stay disciplined in the way we manage our business and cost structure. In Q3, we delivered profitable growth for our shareholders in a competitive and dynamic environment. Next month, we look forward to hosting some of you at our incredible Wisconsin manufacturing facility, where we will build many of our industry-leading direct liquid cooled AI systems. The work we do there plays a key role in driving the transition to direct liquid cooled systems and the successful AI revenue conversion we saw this quarter. I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to experience this. Now, I will hand it over to Marie to go through the segment results in greater detail. Marie?\nMarie Myers: Thank you, Antonio, and good afternoon. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and we did what we said we would do. We delivered strong top-line revenues, grew revenues sequentially in each segment, prudently managed costs, improved profitability sequentially, and delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share that exceeded the high end of our guidance range. As Antonio said, we are pleased to have received the $2.1 billion in proceeds from the partial sale of the H3C equity position. Today's results highlight our ability to deliver amidst a dynamic macro environment. While some customers remain cautious and prioritize mission-critical projects, we are encouraged by the recovery in enterprise demand we are seeing in North America, followed by modest improvement across the other geographies. We remain excited about HPE's position across AI, hybrid cloud, and networking. HPE is well-positioned for the AI opportunity. This quarter, our AI systems backlog increased and we grew AI systems revenues approximately 40% sequentially. We continue to win deals with both model builders and sovereigns and are well-positioned to address enterprise AI demand. In traditional servers, we are seeing signs of a recovery as both demand and revenue increase sequentially. In hybrid cloud, we see an improvement in storage, led by the strong demand for our HPE Alletra MP offering, and we continue to drive ARR growth. We are encouraged by the early and strong customer response to our Private Cloud AI offering that we announced at Discover, which we expect to drive AI adoption in the enterprise. Lastly, results were solid in networking. Improving sequential demand in WLAN, data center networking and switching, along with continued growth in security and services, keeps us optimistic heading into the fourth quarter. We continue to make progress towards our strategic goals. Our recently announced acquisition of Morpheus Data that expands our hybrid cloud capabilities and our confidence in closing the Juniper acquisition by the end of calendar year 2024 or early calendar year 2025 are excellent examples. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in Q3 and look forward to carrying our momentum through the end of our fiscal year. Now, let me go through the details of the quarter. Revenue grew 10% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter in constant currency to $7.7 billion, near the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Our as-a-service momentum continued this quarter. We grew ARR 39% in constant currency year-over-year to more than $1.7 billion, led by AI through HPE GreenLake and networking and storage subscriptions. With enterprise AI customers, we are noticing a strong appetite for a consumption model, both to alleviate investment pressures as well as to retain flexibility to grow workloads, though this is still early days. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin software and services revenue. This quarter, we expanded the software and services mix of ARR approximately 300 basis points year-over-year to 71%, due to the stronger sales of AI services tied to hardware sales and Aruba Central platform subscriptions. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 31.8%, which was down 410 basis points year-over-year, driven by a lower mix of Intelligent Edge revenue and a higher mix of AI server revenue. The 130-basis-point sequential decline was driven by the higher AI server revenue mix. We have balanced gross margin pressures by executing on strong cost controls and by maintaining pricing discipline in a competitive AI server market. Our non-GAAP operating expenses decreased approximately 7% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter despite a seasonal increase in marketing expenses associated with our annual Discover event. Since joining as CFO, I have taken a rigorous, programmatic approach to streamlining our cost structure to drive operating expense improvements. And we expect to see the benefits of these actions in the second half of the year. This is already evident in our results as we drove a 50-basis-point sequential improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin, offsetting pressures we saw at the gross margin line. Our non-GAAP operating margin was stable at 10%. Profitability improvements and better-than-expected OI&E drove GAAP-diluted net EPS of $0.38 per share and our non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.50 per share, both above the high end of our guidance ranges. Our non-GAAP diluted net EPS excludes $149 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisition, and other related charges. Now, let's turn to the segment results, starting with Servers. Strength in both AI systems and traditional servers drove healthy revenue growth and stable operating margins. Server revenues were $4.3 billion in the quarter, up 35% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. In traditional servers, we saw steady growth and are seeing signs of a recovery. We saw strength in North America where our installed base is spending more, though EMEA and APJ customers continue to evaluate spend. Our Gen11 product continues to ramp ahead of expectations and now represents a growing proportion of total server revenue. And we have been able to manage an inflationary component environment through dynamic pricing and by leveraging strong supplier relationships. In AI systems, demand remains strong, though large deals continue to be lumpy. AI systems product and services orders rose $1.6 billion sequentially, driving our cumulative orders since Q1 '23 to $6.2 billion. We are pleased with our current AI systems backlog, which has increased quarter-over-quarter to $3.4 billion. Demand remains healthy from the model builders. We are winning deals in this space and following a framework to manage risks and profits. While still early days, we continue to see positive signs from enterprise customers. In fact, more than 80% of enterprises are experimenting with GenAI initiatives, which supports our view that the number of customers will continue to trend favorably. This quarter, our enterprise AI pipeline more than doubled sequentially. And sovereign AI is an adjacency for HPE, right beside our market leadership in supercomputing. We continue to see increasing demand from this set of customers who are embracing AI. Within model builders and sovereign AI, customers is a growing desire for liquid cooling. However, adoption relies on data center readiness. We view HPE's multi-decade design and manufacturing expertise, intellectual property, patent portfolio, and global reach and dedicated services as clear differentiators as the market moves in this direction. Q3 was again a strong quarter for AI system revenue conversion. AI system revenues were $1.3 billion in the quarter, up approximately 40% from the prior quarter. We are pleased with the stability of our operating margins within our Server business. Our Q3 Server operating margin was 10.8%. This was up 70 basis points year-over-year, but down 20 basis points sequentially. AI systems make up a higher share of our total Server revenue compared to one year ago, 10% in Q3 FY '23 versus 30% this quarter. This underscores our disciplined focus on profitability in a competitive AI server market. Our operating margin performance was in line with expectations. For the full year, we continue to expect our Server margins to be at the low end of our target range of 11% to 13%. We will remain disciplined in cost and price as we pursue profitable growth. Now, moving to Hybrid Cloud. Both revenue and profitability improved quarter-over-quarter. Segment revenues of $1.3 billion were down 7% year-over-year, but up 4% sequentially. As we have previously discussed, we are managing both a sales model transition and product transition within the storage business. Our product model transition is to a more cloud-native, software-defined platform with HPE Alletra, which offers a unified storage architecture, comprehensive AIOps, and cross-stack analytics and aligns to customer preferences for a hybrid cloud model. Translating this storage growth to revenues will take time because of the higher mix of ratable software and services, which is deferred into future periods. We continue to see strength for our Alletra MP offering with sequential improvement led by our continued business transformation efforts, particularly in go-to-market. We are seeing signs of improving demand for block storage and early traction in file, and we are closely monitoring the impacts of commodity costs on demand. In our Private Cloud business, we are having constructive conversations with our customers to evaluate their virtualization strategy. At Discover, we announced efforts to develop our virtualization capabilities, which will be available within our Private Cloud Business Edition solution. Lastly, customers are reacting positively to our recently announced Private Cloud AI offering in partnership with NVIDIA, which unifies AI skills, data, architecture and solutions into one fully managed platform and accelerates time to value for enterprises looking to begin their AI journeys. We are seeing traction in both customer demos and pipeline, and as of yesterday, our Private Cloud AI offering is globally available to order. Our Hybrid Cloud operating margin was 5.1%, down 30 basis points year-over-year, but up 430 basis points sequentially, predominantly due to better OpEx controls. Moving to Intelligent Edge. Revenues were $1.1 billion, down 23% year-over-year on tough compares, but up 3% sequentially. Demand was steady quarter-over-quarter, backlog remains at normal levels, channel inventory remains healthy, and we believe that we have moved past the trough. On the order side, we are seeing a recovery that is in line with our industry peers. For the second consecutive quarter, we saw order improvements in each of our geographies, led by strength in North America, followed by modest growth at EMEA and APJ. By product, we saw sequential order improvements in data center networking and in in-campus. We grew both services and SASE orders mid- to high-single-digits year-over-year as customers remain excited about our Aruba Central platform that is part of our HPE GreenLake offering. On the revenue side, we drove year-over-year strength in data center networking, SASE, and services, though saw declines in our campus and switching due to difficult annual compares. Our sequential revenue grew approximately 3%, consistent with our expectation that Q2 would be the trough. The segment operating margin of 22.4% was down 520 basis points year-over-year, driven by tough year-over-year revenue compares, offset slightly, but a better year-over-year gross margin rate. Better OpEx was the primary reason for our 60-basis-point sequential improvement in operating margin. Our OpEx plan has put us on a path to achieve operating margins in the mid-20% range by Q4. Now, turning to Financial Services. Our HPE Financial Services revenue were $879 million, up 1% year-over-year, and financing volumes were $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, $800 million of $4.5 billion in financing volume went to AI wins with both cloud and enterprise customers, which illustrates that AI is driving demand across our portfolio. Operating margin of 9% was up 80 basis points year-over-year and down 30 basis points sequentially. Our portfolio remains healthy, and we continue to improve the investment-grade mix. Our Q3 loss ratio remained steady at below 0.5% and our return on equity is a solid 17.4%. Turning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations and $669 million in free cash flow. We are on track for $1.9 billion in free cash flow. We remain confident in our ongoing ability to generate strong free cash flow even as we pursue strategic buys given the rising component cost environment. Our Q3 cash conversion cycle was a positive four days, which is a reduction of 19 days from Q3 '23. Our days of inventory and days of payables were both higher on AI systems orders that outpaced revenue conversion and on our strategic purchases for our server business. We continue to believe working capital to be neutral to free cash flow as we expect declines in inventory led by strong AI system revenue conversion to balance declines in accounts payable as we exit the year. We are pleased to have received the $2.1 billion in proceeds from the partial sale of the H3C equity position. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation framework and are focused on managing our balance sheet and maintaining our dividend. We returned $221 million in capital to shareholders in Q3 and $607 million year-to-date. Now, let's turn to guidance. As Antonio mentioned, we are making steady progress on securing the necessary regulatory approvals required for our pending Juniper acquisition and look forward to closing by the end of calendar year '24 or early calendar year '25. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.4 billion, GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.76 and $0.81, and our non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.52 and $0.57. For revenue, we expect to see sequential growth similar to the last couple of quarters with revenue to remain indexed towards server. We continue to manage the business at the operating income level and, therefore, expect a sequential decline in operating expenses in order to deliver our EPS targets. On a segment basis, we expect the following. For Server, we expect to convert AI systems to revenue at a strong pace. As mentioned, the market remains competitive and large deals remain lumpy. We continue to be time-to-market for GPUs and are looking forward to shipping H200 chips for the AIST supercomputer in Q4. We also expect a continued demand in traditional servers, driven by Gen11 adoption and higher units. We are maintaining our expectation of achieving the low end of our 11% to 13% operating margin range for the full year. For Hybrid Cloud, we expect a slight revenue increase to close the year, though expect pressures from rising commodity costs, particularly in SSDs. ARR growth should continue as our storage business accelerates and shifts to subscription under HPE GreenLake. And we expect operating margins to continue to trend favorably to the mid-single-digit range. For the Intelligent Edge business, we anticipate a slight sequential revenue increase for the fourth quarter on the recovery in campus and WLAN, as well as strength in data center networking. Benefits from our cost reduction efforts materialized in our third quarter results, and we expect a similar trend in the fourth quarter, supporting our outlook for a full year operating margin in the mid-20% range. For the full year, we are tracking towards the high end of our revenue guidance of 1% to 3% growth in constant currency. We expect to balance gross margin pressures from a higher mix of AI systems with continued operating discipline and expect to come in at the low end of our operating profit growth guidance of 0% to 2%. We now expect OI&E to be a $50 million to $100 million headwind versus our prior expectation of $150 million headwind. We have tightened our non-GAAP diluted net EPS expectations for the full year to $1.92 to $1.97. For GAAP EPS, we are now seeing increased costs related to the Juniper transaction, with our expectations now at $1.68 to $1.73. Lastly, we remain committed, in the long term, to our balanced capital allocation framework, our dividend, and to our investment-grade rating. In the near term, we expect to continue share repurchases at a pace in line with Q3, as we prudently manage our balance sheet ahead of the Juniper transaction closing. To summarize, our Q3 results were strong and demonstrated good sequential revenue growth. With that, I'll turn it over for Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks, and congrats on the results. Maybe just on the Server margins, given the AI revenue contribution, they were a little bit higher than expected. Could you just break down? Is this from kind of better ProLiant margins, better kind of proprietary Cray margins, just better pricing discipline? Just a little bit more insight into the margin strength we saw there? Thank you.\nMarie Myers: Yeah, sure. Good afternoon, Meta, and thanks for your question on Server margins. First of all, as I said in my prepared remarks, we did, in fact, ship about $1.3 billion of AI servers in the quarter. So that constituted around about 30% of Server revenue. And despite that, our margins were at 10.8%. And to your point, what was it driven by? So, first of all, we're well on track on the shift to Gen11, and in itself, Gen11 has richer configurations and, therefore, comes with a higher margin profile. Also, I think we've been pretty successful at passing through those commodity costs, and despite the fact that we're in a pretty competitive both CPU and GPU environment. And then lastly, I'd say you would have seen that our OpEx was down sequentially and you're seeing the impact, frankly, of that OpEx discipline show up in the margins as well, Meta.\nPaul Glaser: Okay. Thank you, Meta. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question, and I apologize in advance if there's some background noise because I'm at the airport. I guess, we're getting the most questions today on the gross margin. And Marie, I know you outlined the factors there in terms of the AI server mix. But hoping you can flesh that out a bit more in terms of was there anything outside of the AI server mix that impacted gross margins at the company level in the quarter itself? And as we think about sort of your operating discipline going into the next quarter, should we be expecting sort of further moderation in the gross margins and more operating discipline to help maintain that operating margin outlook? And if I can just add on there, the AI order execution that you're seeing, you mentioned lumpy deals with customers. Is that impacting your thinking on gross margins for the aggregate company as we look forward as well in terms of where -- which verticals those orders are coming from? Thank you.\nMarie Myers: Hey, Samik, good afternoon. So, I think I've got most of your questions. I'll hit it up in terms of gross margins and what we've seen. So first of all, I would say just if you step back and think about gross margins at a high level, from a year-on-year perspective, just to remind everybody that obviously the contribution from our networking revenue is lowest. Obviously, that's impacted gross margins from a year-on-year basis. Now, when you look sequentially, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, the AI mix of servers, we converted at a much faster pace. And obviously, that's really driven margin -- gross margin in the quarter. Now, I would add to your point, we've been offsetting it with prudency on OpEx. You've seen that we're going to continue to do that. I think I mentioned that in my guide comments. And then, also, we continue to have a mindset about being very disciplined on cost and price as we pursue profitable growth. I think we talked about the fact we're selective on deals. And you see that frankly, if you look at the quality of our receivables, you'll see it in our receivables. Now, a couple of things to sort of bear in mind as we go forward. As we see enterprise AI gain momentum, that's going to have a more favorable impact on gross margins. So, we do expect that we'll see improving profitability as the market moves in that direction. And then finally, Samik, just to sort of bear in mind that we're getting closer to the close of Juniper. We expect to see that the end of calendar '24, beginning of '25. In itself, that transaction is going to have a significant impact on both gross and operating margins. And we expect that more than 50% of the company's operating profit will come from networking. So that's how I'd sort of leave it with you in terms of thinking about margins. And as we said, we'll continue to focus on managing OpEx and being very prudent on deals.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you, Samik. Gary, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit, your line is open on our end, perhaps it's muted on yours.\nAmit Daryanani: Sorry. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Marie, I was hoping you can talk a bit more about the free cash flow numbers. It was down a fair bit year-over-year. Maybe you can just talk about what is driving the downtick in free cash flow. Is there a way to think about the headwind you're seeing from the AI ramps versus the strategic pre-buys? Just talk about what those buckets are? And then, related to free cash flow, I think last quarter, it was at least $1.9 billion for the full year. I think this time it's $1.9 billion. So, seems like a bit of a downtick. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but could you just talk about how do you think about that October quarter free cash flow number as well? Thank you.\nMarie Myers: Yeah, sure. No worries, Amit. And so, yeah, I think you probably are -- just in terms of where we're at in cash flow, let me hit Q3 and then I'll go into Q4. So, from a Q3 perspective, it's really driven by a couple of things. Firstly, the timing of working capital, and also just some of the normal seasonality that we see. And then, as we get into Q4, we do expect to see some of the benefits of working capital. So, we'll see a reversal in CCC, and that will benefit free cash flow. And then, obviously, we're going to see that stronger conversion of AI revenue. I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're going to see a sequential improvement in the shipment of AI revenue. So, you can see that will also have an impact on our free cash flow. So, for the full year, Amit, I'd just say we are still on track for $1.9 billion. It's just as you could imagine, we're in Q3 now, we're getting into Q4, we sort of tightened up the expectations given where we're at in the year. So, still on track for $1.9 billion, Amit.\nPaul Glaser: Very good. Thank you, Amit. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. You did mention repeatedly the lumpiness of AI server deals, and I'm wondering if there was any unusually large deals in Q3, or whether you're anticipating your AI bookings to be significantly different in Q4. And then just on the free cash flow, Marie, net income is going to be about $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Free cash flow is going to be about $1.9 billion. That's about 75% realization. I think since HPE split-off, free cash flow realization has actually been even lower than that. How do we think about that going forward? I presume free cash flow realization will be less than [1%] (ph) for next year and maybe even the following year because of Juniper integration charges? Or where is the pathway to where we can see free cash flow to net income being positive?\nAntonio Neri: Yeah. Thank you, Toni. This is Antonio. I'm going to take the first part. The quick answer is no. There have not been very, very large deals or lumpy deals. It's been more spread and more uniform across the service provider space. And on the enterprise side, because obviously, we talk about this, the percentage of bookings relative to the $1.6 billion was -- as a mix, was in the mid-teens. So, very consistent with the prior year's quarter. However, obviously, the dollars are much larger, right, because now this quarter, we book $1.6 billion. So, I actually argue this is a good thing. And we don't expect significant super-large deals, I'd call it, in Q4 based on what we have visibility in the pipeline, but more a continuation of what we saw in Q3. And Marie, you want to talk about the free cash flow?\nMarie Myers: Yeah. No, just, Toni, I mean, I think in terms of your comments on free cash flow, from an FY '24 perspective, I mean, in terms of bridging net earnings to free cash flow, it's the normal puts and takes for the year, so working capital, CapEx, et cetera. and sort of employee benefits. So, there is no specific charges in there in terms of our working capital -- sort of our net earnings for the year to free cash flow. In terms of '25, what we said, Toni, I think in the transaction stays the same. And look, honestly, we'll be guiding '25 when we do our next earnings call. So, I'll provide more color around free cash flow for '25 as we get into the next call.\nPaul Glaser: All right. Thank you, Toni. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I just had a question about the mix of products and services for the AI systems orders and revenues that you guys disclosed on Slide 12. I guess, I was struck by two things. First, the growing share of services as a percentage of AI system orders, should we expect that to continue over time? And what are some of the key services you're selling with AI systems? And then, second, the very little services revenue that's being recognized to-date, as you recognize that services revenue in AI systems, should that improve the margins for server margins and AI system margins? And how much can that improve margins by? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah, thanks, Mike. Yeah, listen, we are very pleased with the services attached momentum on the AI systems portion of our business, which I believe will continue to grow as we grow the enterprise segment of the market, because that segment of the market comes with more rich services day zero, day one and day two services like we call it. And yesterday was the first day it became available out of HPE Private Cloud AI, and that has quite a bit of services component with it. And so -- but right now, as we started disclosing last quarter, the services component of that which you saw in one of the slides, as Marie was providing her remarks, much of that is pretty much all deferred. So, unless we are doing an installation and that gets recognized immediately, most of that is the maintenance that gets recognized over the length of the contract. And therefore, over time, we expect that will be contributing positive to our gross margins in the segment that we recognize that revenue, which obviously is the Server segment of the market. So, yes, but I'm positive on both gross margin accretion as we recognize the revenue and more services as we start selling the HPE Private Cloud in the enterprise space.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you, Mike. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much. I wanted to see, Antonio, if you could talk a little bit about the trends with traditional servers, given we hear these arguments that AI-accelerated platforms would cannibalize traditional servers, but you're seeing good growth and good order patterns. How should we think about the risk that maybe that cannibalization eventually happens, or how are you really thinking about traditional versus AI? Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah. Thank you, Simon. We have seen no signs of cannibalization into the traditional server market. And remember, I always try to bring a segment point of view, right? So, the segment point of view in the AI space, you have three segments. You have the service providers, model builders, which obviously include the hyperscalers, and there we have not sold traditional servers in a long time once we made the decision in 2017 to not participate in that market. And then, you have the sovereign space, which is now going up in term of interest, but the sales cycles are longer because of the government engagements and the procurement, but there, generally speaking, there is no traditional service per se. It's a combination of architectures and GPUs and CPUs in a unique form factor. And then last but not least, we have the enterprise. And the enterprise, while it's growing, has been very much focused on the AI applications. And for customers to move a traditional workload, call it, legacy workloads and the like, to a accelerated compute, the question is why you will do that when, A, you need to use the accelerated compute to either fine-tune the model or to do inferencing; and second, from a PCO perspective, there is no clear view that, that will be cost less. And so that's why when I think about workloads and customer segments, we don't see signs of cannibalization from the AI deployments into the traditional workloads.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you, Simon. Gary, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yeah, thank you so much. Antonio, I was wondering if you could just share some color on why the -- on what the AI backlog composition is across maybe your portfolio where you're seeing more strength versus not. And within the enterprise demand commentary that you're calling out, can you share some color on what kind of projects are being evaluated? I know you called out some verticals like healthcare and financial services. Curious if you could provide some color on that as well. Thank you so much.\nAntonio Neri: Yeah. So, first of all, the pipeline we have in front of us is multiples of the current backlog, which is a positive news, because that tells you the momentum will continue in the next few quarters. Second is that the backlog composition, as I said, in the mid-teens is the enterprise space and the rest is the traditional service provider space. On the service provider space is basically compute capacity to train models or to do hosting for that matter, in large colos. And then, on the enterprise space is really focused on the use cases where they see clear line of sight for the return on that investment, and there are several use cases by segment that customers by verticals that they are driving. Obviously, many of them are very obvious. And now we are seeing a little bit more sophistication in some of those use cases and the maturity of. And that's why our Private Cloud AI offering is targeting those type of customers, because ultimately comes with entire stack from the, what I call, the workloads at the top, specifically designed for the verticals, down into the training models, all the way down to the infrastructure. They are sized for that type of deployment. And then, on the sovereign AI, obviously, we see now a significant interest. We are working across multiple geos on several opportunities. A lot of them are basically to open AI clouds for sovereign reasons or privates and compliance reasons on data. And a lot of them actually want to look a little bit like supercomputers in many ways because many of those systems are designed to do both AI large language models, and that's very obvious with some of the deployments we have done in the European Union and the one we're going to do now for the U.K. And other ones are basically for traditional supercomputing. So, the infrastructure in the end is the same. All of these systems are very much liquid cooled systems. And so, that's an opportunity for us. But on the enterprise side, I think you can see now expansion from traditional bots and customer service into other areas in finance, manufacturing, marketing, where they can see the clear return on that investment. And we're helping them even upfront through a partner ecosystem to define those use cases, because ultimately, it goes beyond just deploying IT, but they're really to realize the business value.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you, Wamsi. Last question, please.\nOperator: And the final question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, guys, yeah, good afternoon. Really appreciate you taking the question. Maybe, Antonio, actually just dovetailing from there, like I'd love any more insight you can give a context around, like what's the HPE sort of sweet spot right now for business you win in GenAI, like what types of deployments or workloads? And then, how do you see that -- do you see that changing, or how do you see that evolving over the next few years as well? And that's it for me. Thanks, guys.\nAntonio Neri: Well, I think right now, one of the key sweet spots is we now have to build and deploy and run these large systems. That requires a unique expertise. That's why you see the services portion being attached to those assistants. And ultimately, you need expertise both in the manufacturing space. And again, we're going to host our AI Day in one of, what I believe is, the largest footprints in the world where you can see how this gets done. And then, on the services side, you should not underestimate the services expertise needed to run. But for enterprise, where is the next big thing is -- in my view, is all about the simplicity. And several of the patterns we are actually filing and getting done are actually in areas like ease of use, automation, obviously, security. These are all spaces where we are actually building all those capabilities in our offer. And remember, all of this gets built inside HPE GreenLake as we deploy these optimized infrastructure and configurations. And that's why for me, GreenLake is an important component of our AI strategy, because ultimately, we manage a lot of the deployment on-prem through enterprise customers, specifically, through HPE GreenLake. And that's an accelerator and a way to upsell, cross-sell, build, ultimately, customers' confidence and control of the data, which is the fundamental value when it comes down to AI. And then, next year, once we close the Juniper transaction, we're going to add another key component, which is the networking piece. And it's very important that we recognize that AI, A, is a hybrid workload. The core foundation of that across hybrid is the network. And HPE will have unique IP and capabilities in that space in addition to the traditional server storage, which is now certified for AI, and then the GreenLake software and services attached to it. And that's how I want to think about it. Independent businesses are all accretive to AI, but then when we get to a solution, HPE will have the full-stack solution to offer to our enterprise customers.\nPaul Glaser: Thank you very much. Antonio, any comments?\nAntonio Neri: Yeah, no, thank you very much for the time. Again, I will say we delivered a strong quarter. We drove very strong revenue growth. We said what -- we did what we said. And honestly, I'm very confident about the next quarter and what comes next after the Juniper acquisition. I'm super-pleased that we also closed the first tranche of our H3C put option. Obviously, that took a lot of work in an environment that's complex. And as you think about our ability to deliver profitable growth is there. I understand the questions around margins, but when I think about margins, on the server side, we are consistently driving a stable around 11% or so operating margins. We think about that way more than gross margin because ultimately it's all about cash. And then, ultimately, on the networking and hybrid cloud is about both gross margin, because of our content is more software and services, while we'll deliver on the bottom-line. So, I think our strategy all coming together, but it's very competitive dynamic there and we have to execute every day with discipline, which is what we did again this quarter. And again, we raised guidance for the full year on the EPS side of the house. So, thank you very much for your time. And I look forward to hosting some of you at our facility in Wisconsin on October 10.\nPaul Glaser: Very good. Thank you, everyone, for joining today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marie Myers",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio, and good afternoon. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and we did what we said we would do. We delivered strong top-line revenues, grew revenues sequentially in each segment, prudently managed costs, improved profitability sequentially, and delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share that exceeded the high end of our guidance range. As Antonio said, we are pleased to have received the $2.1 billion in proceeds from the partial sale of the H3C equity position. Today's results highlight our ability to deliver amidst a dynamic macro environment. While some customers remain cautious and prioritize mission-critical projects, we are encouraged by the recovery in enterprise demand we are seeing in North America, followed by modest improvement across the other geographies. We remain excited about HPE's position across AI, hybrid cloud, and networking. HPE is well-positioned for the AI opportunity. This quarter, our AI systems backlog increased and we grew AI systems revenues approximately 40% sequentially. We continue to win deals with both model builders and sovereigns and are well-positioned to address enterprise AI demand. In traditional servers, we are seeing signs of a recovery as both demand and revenue increase sequentially. In hybrid cloud, we see an improvement in storage, led by the strong demand for our HPE Alletra MP offering, and we continue to drive ARR growth. We are encouraged by the early and strong customer response to our Private Cloud AI offering that we announced at Discover, which we expect to drive AI adoption in the enterprise. Lastly, results were solid in networking. Improving sequential demand in WLAN, data center networking and switching, along with continued growth in security and services, keeps us optimistic heading into the fourth quarter. We continue to make progress towards our strategic goals. Our recently announced acquisition of Morpheus Data that expands our hybrid cloud capabilities and our confidence in closing the Juniper acquisition by the end of calendar year 2024 or early calendar year 2025 are excellent examples. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in Q3 and look forward to carrying our momentum through the end of our fiscal year. Now, let me go through the details of the quarter. Revenue grew 10% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter in constant currency to $7.7 billion, near the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Our as-a-service momentum continued this quarter. We grew ARR 39% in constant currency year-over-year to more than $1.7 billion, led by AI through HPE GreenLake and networking and storage subscriptions. With enterprise AI customers, we are noticing a strong appetite for a consumption model, both to alleviate investment pressures as well as to retain flexibility to grow workloads, though this is still early days. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin software and services revenue. This quarter, we expanded the software and services mix of ARR approximately 300 basis points year-over-year to 71%, due to the stronger sales of AI services tied to hardware sales and Aruba Central platform subscriptions. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 31.8%, which was down 410 basis points year-over-year, driven by a lower mix of Intelligent Edge revenue and a higher mix of AI server revenue. The 130-basis-point sequential decline was driven by the higher AI server revenue mix. We have balanced gross margin pressures by executing on strong cost controls and by maintaining pricing discipline in a competitive AI server market. Our non-GAAP operating expenses decreased approximately 7% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter despite a seasonal increase in marketing expenses associated with our annual Discover event. Since joining as CFO, I have taken a rigorous, programmatic approach to streamlining our cost structure to drive operating expense improvements. And we expect to see the benefits of these actions in the second half of the year. This is already evident in our results as we drove a 50-basis-point sequential improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin, offsetting pressures we saw at the gross margin line. Our non-GAAP operating margin was stable at 10%. Profitability improvements and better-than-expected OI&E drove GAAP-diluted net EPS of $0.38 per share and our non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.50 per share, both above the high end of our guidance ranges. Our non-GAAP diluted net EPS excludes $149 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisition, and other related charges. Now, let's turn to the segment results, starting with Servers. Strength in both AI systems and traditional servers drove healthy revenue growth and stable operating margins. Server revenues were $4.3 billion in the quarter, up 35% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. In traditional servers, we saw steady growth and are seeing signs of a recovery. We saw strength in North America where our installed base is spending more, though EMEA and APJ customers continue to evaluate spend. Our Gen11 product continues to ramp ahead of expectations and now represents a growing proportion of total server revenue. And we have been able to manage an inflationary component environment through dynamic pricing and by leveraging strong supplier relationships. In AI systems, demand remains strong, though large deals continue to be lumpy. AI systems product and services orders rose $1.6 billion sequentially, driving our cumulative orders since Q1 '23 to $6.2 billion. We are pleased with our current AI systems backlog, which has increased quarter-over-quarter to $3.4 billion. Demand remains healthy from the model builders. We are winning deals in this space and following a framework to manage risks and profits. While still early days, we continue to see positive signs from enterprise customers. In fact, more than 80% of enterprises are experimenting with GenAI initiatives, which supports our view that the number of customers will continue to trend favorably. This quarter, our enterprise AI pipeline more than doubled sequentially. And sovereign AI is an adjacency for HPE, right beside our market leadership in supercomputing. We continue to see increasing demand from this set of customers who are embracing AI. Within model builders and sovereign AI, customers is a growing desire for liquid cooling. However, adoption relies on data center readiness. We view HPE's multi-decade design and manufacturing expertise, intellectual property, patent portfolio, and global reach and dedicated services as clear differentiators as the market moves in this direction. Q3 was again a strong quarter for AI system revenue conversion. AI system revenues were $1.3 billion in the quarter, up approximately 40% from the prior quarter. We are pleased with the stability of our operating margins within our Server business. Our Q3 Server operating margin was 10.8%. This was up 70 basis points year-over-year, but down 20 basis points sequentially. AI systems make up a higher share of our total Server revenue compared to one year ago, 10% in Q3 FY '23 versus 30% this quarter. This underscores our disciplined focus on profitability in a competitive AI server market. Our operating margin performance was in line with expectations. For the full year, we continue to expect our Server margins to be at the low end of our target range of 11% to 13%. We will remain disciplined in cost and price as we pursue profitable growth. Now, moving to Hybrid Cloud. Both revenue and profitability improved quarter-over-quarter. Segment revenues of $1.3 billion were down 7% year-over-year, but up 4% sequentially. As we have previously discussed, we are managing both a sales model transition and product transition within the storage business. Our product model transition is to a more cloud-native, software-defined platform with HPE Alletra, which offers a unified storage architecture, comprehensive AIOps, and cross-stack analytics and aligns to customer preferences for a hybrid cloud model. Translating this storage growth to revenues will take time because of the higher mix of ratable software and services, which is deferred into future periods. We continue to see strength for our Alletra MP offering with sequential improvement led by our continued business transformation efforts, particularly in go-to-market. We are seeing signs of improving demand for block storage and early traction in file, and we are closely monitoring the impacts of commodity costs on demand. In our Private Cloud business, we are having constructive conversations with our customers to evaluate their virtualization strategy. At Discover, we announced efforts to develop our virtualization capabilities, which will be available within our Private Cloud Business Edition solution. Lastly, customers are reacting positively to our recently announced Private Cloud AI offering in partnership with NVIDIA, which unifies AI skills, data, architecture and solutions into one fully managed platform and accelerates time to value for enterprises looking to begin their AI journeys. We are seeing traction in both customer demos and pipeline, and as of yesterday, our Private Cloud AI offering is globally available to order. Our Hybrid Cloud operating margin was 5.1%, down 30 basis points year-over-year, but up 430 basis points sequentially, predominantly due to better OpEx controls. Moving to Intelligent Edge. Revenues were $1.1 billion, down 23% year-over-year on tough compares, but up 3% sequentially. Demand was steady quarter-over-quarter, backlog remains at normal levels, channel inventory remains healthy, and we believe that we have moved past the trough. On the order side, we are seeing a recovery that is in line with our industry peers. For the second consecutive quarter, we saw order improvements in each of our geographies, led by strength in North America, followed by modest growth at EMEA and APJ. By product, we saw sequential order improvements in data center networking and in in-campus. We grew both services and SASE orders mid- to high-single-digits year-over-year as customers remain excited about our Aruba Central platform that is part of our HPE GreenLake offering. On the revenue side, we drove year-over-year strength in data center networking, SASE, and services, though saw declines in our campus and switching due to difficult annual compares. Our sequential revenue grew approximately 3%, consistent with our expectation that Q2 would be the trough. The segment operating margin of 22.4% was down 520 basis points year-over-year, driven by tough year-over-year revenue compares, offset slightly, but a better year-over-year gross margin rate. Better OpEx was the primary reason for our 60-basis-point sequential improvement in operating margin. Our OpEx plan has put us on a path to achieve operating margins in the mid-20% range by Q4. Now, turning to Financial Services. Our HPE Financial Services revenue were $879 million, up 1% year-over-year, and financing volumes were $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, $800 million of $4.5 billion in financing volume went to AI wins with both cloud and enterprise customers, which illustrates that AI is driving demand across our portfolio. Operating margin of 9% was up 80 basis points year-over-year and down 30 basis points sequentially. Our portfolio remains healthy, and we continue to improve the investment-grade mix. Our Q3 loss ratio remained steady at below 0.5% and our return on equity is a solid 17.4%. Turning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations and $669 million in free cash flow. We are on track for $1.9 billion in free cash flow. We remain confident in our ongoing ability to generate strong free cash flow even as we pursue strategic buys given the rising component cost environment. Our Q3 cash conversion cycle was a positive four days, which is a reduction of 19 days from Q3 '23. Our days of inventory and days of payables were both higher on AI systems orders that outpaced revenue conversion and on our strategic purchases for our server business. We continue to believe working capital to be neutral to free cash flow as we expect declines in inventory led by strong AI system revenue conversion to balance declines in accounts payable as we exit the year. We are pleased to have received the $2.1 billion in proceeds from the partial sale of the H3C equity position. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation framework and are focused on managing our balance sheet and maintaining our dividend. We returned $221 million in capital to shareholders in Q3 and $607 million year-to-date. Now, let's turn to guidance. As Antonio mentioned, we are making steady progress on securing the necessary regulatory approvals required for our pending Juniper acquisition and look forward to closing by the end of calendar year '24 or early calendar year '25. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.4 billion, GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.76 and $0.81, and our non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.52 and $0.57. For revenue, we expect to see sequential growth similar to the last couple of quarters with revenue to remain indexed towards server. We continue to manage the business at the operating income level and, therefore, expect a sequential decline in operating expenses in order to deliver our EPS targets. On a segment basis, we expect the following. For Server, we expect to convert AI systems to revenue at a strong pace. As mentioned, the market remains competitive and large deals remain lumpy. We continue to be time-to-market for GPUs and are looking forward to shipping H200 chips for the AIST supercomputer in Q4. We also expect a continued demand in traditional servers, driven by Gen11 adoption and higher units. We are maintaining our expectation of achieving the low end of our 11% to 13% operating margin range for the full year. For Hybrid Cloud, we expect a slight revenue increase to close the year, though expect pressures from rising commodity costs, particularly in SSDs. ARR growth should continue as our storage business accelerates and shifts to subscription under HPE GreenLake. And we expect operating margins to continue to trend favorably to the mid-single-digit range. For the Intelligent Edge business, we anticipate a slight sequential revenue increase for the fourth quarter on the recovery in campus and WLAN, as well as strength in data center networking. Benefits from our cost reduction efforts materialized in our third quarter results, and we expect a similar trend in the fourth quarter, supporting our outlook for a full year operating margin in the mid-20% range. For the full year, we are tracking towards the high end of our revenue guidance of 1% to 3% growth in constant currency. We expect to balance gross margin pressures from a higher mix of AI systems with continued operating discipline and expect to come in at the low end of our operating profit growth guidance of 0% to 2%. We now expect OI&E to be a $50 million to $100 million headwind versus our prior expectation of $150 million headwind. We have tightened our non-GAAP diluted net EPS expectations for the full year to $1.92 to $1.97. For GAAP EPS, we are now seeing increased costs related to the Juniper transaction, with our expectations now at $1.68 to $1.73. Lastly, we remain committed, in the long term, to our balanced capital allocation framework, our dividend, and to our investment-grade rating. In the near term, we expect to continue share repurchases at a pace in line with Q3, as we prudently manage our balance sheet ahead of the Juniper transaction closing. To summarize, our Q3 results were strong and demonstrated good sequential revenue growth. With that, I'll turn it over for Q&A. Yeah, sure. Good afternoon, Meta, and thanks for your question on Server margins. First of all, as I said in my prepared remarks, we did, in fact, ship about $1.3 billion of AI servers in the quarter. So that constituted around about 30% of Server revenue. And despite that, our margins were at 10.8%. And to your point, what was it driven by? So, first of all, we're well on track on the shift to Gen11, and in itself, Gen11 has richer configurations and, therefore, comes with a higher margin profile. Also, I think we've been pretty successful at passing through those commodity costs, and despite the fact that we're in a pretty competitive both CPU and GPU environment. And then lastly, I'd say you would have seen that our OpEx was down sequentially and you're seeing the impact, frankly, of that OpEx discipline show up in the margins as well, Meta. Hey, Samik, good afternoon. So, I think I've got most of your questions. I'll hit it up in terms of gross margins and what we've seen. So first of all, I would say just if you step back and think about gross margins at a high level, from a year-on-year perspective, just to remind everybody that obviously the contribution from our networking revenue is lowest. Obviously, that's impacted gross margins from a year-on-year basis. Now, when you look sequentially, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, the AI mix of servers, we converted at a much faster pace. And obviously, that's really driven margin -- gross margin in the quarter. Now, I would add to your point, we've been offsetting it with prudency on OpEx. You've seen that we're going to continue to do that. I think I mentioned that in my guide comments. And then, also, we continue to have a mindset about being very disciplined on cost and price as we pursue profitable growth. I think we talked about the fact we're selective on deals. And you see that frankly, if you look at the quality of our receivables, you'll see it in our receivables. Now, a couple of things to sort of bear in mind as we go forward. As we see enterprise AI gain momentum, that's going to have a more favorable impact on gross margins. So, we do expect that we'll see improving profitability as the market moves in that direction. And then finally, Samik, just to sort of bear in mind that we're getting closer to the close of Juniper. We expect to see that the end of calendar '24, beginning of '25. In itself, that transaction is going to have a significant impact on both gross and operating margins. And we expect that more than 50% of the company's operating profit will come from networking. So that's how I'd sort of leave it with you in terms of thinking about margins. And as we said, we'll continue to focus on managing OpEx and being very prudent on deals. Yeah, sure. No worries, Amit. And so, yeah, I think you probably are -- just in terms of where we're at in cash flow, let me hit Q3 and then I'll go into Q4. So, from a Q3 perspective, it's really driven by a couple of things. Firstly, the timing of working capital, and also just some of the normal seasonality that we see. And then, as we get into Q4, we do expect to see some of the benefits of working capital. So, we'll see a reversal in CCC, and that will benefit free cash flow. And then, obviously, we're going to see that stronger conversion of AI revenue. I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're going to see a sequential improvement in the shipment of AI revenue. So, you can see that will also have an impact on our free cash flow. So, for the full year, Amit, I'd just say we are still on track for $1.9 billion. It's just as you could imagine, we're in Q3 now, we're getting into Q4, we sort of tightened up the expectations given where we're at in the year. So, still on track for $1.9 billion, Amit. Yeah. No, just, Toni, I mean, I think in terms of your comments on free cash flow, from an FY '24 perspective, I mean, in terms of bridging net earnings to free cash flow, it's the normal puts and takes for the year, so working capital, CapEx, et cetera. and sort of employee benefits. So, there is no specific charges in there in terms of our working capital -- sort of our net earnings for the year to free cash flow. In terms of '25, what we said, Toni, I think in the transaction stays the same. And look, honestly, we'll be guiding '25 when we do our next earnings call. So, I'll provide more color around free cash flow for '25 as we get into the next call."

            "content": "Thank you, Paul, and welcome to your new role leading investor relations at HPE. And thank you, all, for joining us today. HPE delivered a strong third quarter performance. We generated impressive revenue growth with notable acceleration of AI systems revenue conversion, as well as higher operating margin from the prior quarter. Net revenue was $7.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share rose $0.01 from a year ago to $0.50 in Q3, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance. We generated a free cash flow of more than $660 million, and will pay a dividend of $0.30 per share. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. Marie will provide further details in her remarks. Lastly, we are also pleased to have received the first payment of $2.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of part of our equity position in H3C. Overall, the demand environment this quarter has improved. We saw sequential and year-over-year orders growth, but with some geographic variation. Demand was strong in North America, Asia-Pacific, Japan and India, while Europe and the Middle East lagged. We are aggressively going after the opportunities presented by better market conditions and are well-positioned in a competitive and dynamic environment as we close our fiscal year. I am very proud of the progress we have made in delivering on our edge-to-cloud vision over the last several years, which is generating this performance momentum. We have accelerated innovation across all pillars of our strategy. Networking, hybrid cloud, and AI delivered through a unified cloud-native and AI-driven experience as a part of our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Today, almost 37,000 unique customers use our HPE GreenLake cloud to manage their hybrid IT estate, which drives our annualized revenue run rate subscription growth. In Intelligent Edge, we have invested in building an industry-leading AI-driven networking portfolio. HPE Aruba Networking is a recognized market leader in the campus and branch segment. The AI market requires a modern, high-performing networking fabric as a core foundation to deliver a more efficient data center cloud infrastructure as the world transitions to accelerated computing. We are excited to significantly expand our networking business with the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks. The acquisition of this high-margin business will accelerate our edge-to-cloud vision with a full networking IP stack, from silicon to infrastructure, to the operating system, to security, to software and services in a cloud-native and AI-driven approach. We expect our compelling value proposition will begin to deliver returns to our shareholders in the year post close. In Hybrid Cloud, we redefine the cloud space by delivering an experience that is hybrid by design, with HPE GreenLake at the core of our strategy. We have transitioned our HPE server and HPE storage products to cloud-native and software-defined solutions while adding unique software and services to our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Our innovation gives customer choice and flexibility across all workload types, while managing their public on-prem colos and edges in one unified hybrid cloud operations experience. Our AI business is built on decades of large-scale infrastructure expertise, including technologies like direct liquid cooling that they're powering our largest AI systems for large language model builders, service providers, and supercomputing users. We have rapidly expanded our AI portfolio, including the introduction of HPE Private Cloud AI, specifically engineered for enterprise customers, with the expectation of significant market expansion as we are still in the early stages of adoption. Pursuing this strategy has diversified the HPE portfolio to parts of the market with higher margins. Our differentiation not only makes us highly relevant to customers and partners, but also drives profitable growth for our shareholders. I have a few observations about Q3 performance in our key segments that I will share, and then I will let Marie fully review more detailed results. Our Server segment, again, outperformed expectations in Q3, thanks to an acceleration in converting AI system orders to revenue. We converted about $1.3 billion in AI systems revenue this quarter, a 39% increase from Q2. Revenue from our traditional server business also climbed with a double-digit increase in product orders, both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting an improvement in the market for traditional compute. We continue to pursue profitable deals within our target server margin range, underscoring stability in our operating profit profile. In AI, our momentum is very clear. Customer demand for HPE AI systems rose sequentially, with opportunities increasing in both enterprise and sovereign AI clouds as customers explore more use cases. AI system orders climbed $1.6 billion in the quarter to a cumulative $6.2 billion since Q1 2023, an increase of approximately $3.5 billion over the last year. Customers are exploring new ways to use AI, adding to our already robust pipeline and creating even more runway for our broad AI offerings. Enterprise interest in generative AI is high, and while adoption is still in the initial stages, it is accelerating. Customers tell us that they see the possibilities and are building the business cases. We see use cases across multiple verticals, from healthcare to financial services to manufacturing. As the use cases mature, they need expertise to help guide the implementation across their enterprise business, not just IT. Direct liquid cooling continues to be a key differentiator and demand driver with large-scale AI customers. The expertise in IP required to build and run large direct liquid cooled systems creates a significant margin rich services opportunity for day zero, day one, and day two operations. HPE has one of the largest water cooling manufacturing and services footprint in the world. In the sovereign space, just recently, the U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory announced that its HPE-built Kestrel supercomputer came fully online over the summer. Kestrel will be five times more powerful than NREL's previous supercomputer, Eagle, and is 100% direct liquid cooled. This system will enable research advancing energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, renewable energy, and energy system integration, including by leveraging the latest innovation in AI large language model, modeling, and simulation. You saw at HPE Discover that HPE is deepening our strong partnership with NVIDIA. In June, we jointly announced NVIDIA AI Computing by HPE, a portfolio of codeveloped AI solutions and joint go-to-market integrations that enable enterprises to accelerate adoption of generative AI. One of those solutions, HPE Private Cloud AI, which just became generally available yesterday, is a turnkey solution that makes it easy for enterprises of all sizes to gain an energy-efficient, fast and flexible option for sustainably developing and deploying generative AI applications. To this adoption, HPE Private Cloud AI will be available in four modular configurations. These start with small-for-small model inferencing needs on NVIDIA L40 and scale up to extra large on NVIDIA Grace Hopper 200s for a configuration that allows for multiple use cases, running inferencing retrieval, augmentation generation, and large language model fine-tuning. We are offering customers two important choice points: self-managed or fully-managed service, with the ability to purchase as-a-service through an operating expenditure model or as a capital expense. With three clicks and less than 30 seconds to deploy, HPE Private Cloud AI dramatically simplifies DevOps, ITOps and FinOps for enterprise customers, allowing them to easily establish and meter their environments, monitor and observe their infrastructure and applications, and lifecycle manage all aspects of their private cloud AI system. And just last week, we further expanded our NVIDIA partnership by adding NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints to HPE Private Cloud AI for multiple generative AI use cases. This includes a digital human workflow for customer service, a generative virtual screening workflow for computer-aided drug discovery, and a PDF data extraction workflow for enterprise RAG that uses vast quantity of business data for more accurate responses. Integrating this catalog of pretrained, customizable AI workflows into our HPE Private Cloud AI stack enables customers to easily deploy key AI use cases to accelerate time to value. With a series of announcements about HPE Private Cloud AI, we are well-positioned to serve our enterprise customer needs. Since the announcement less than three months ago, we have seen very high customer interest, with requests for proof of concept demos exceeding our expectations. We are increasing sales resources and enabling our partner ecosystem to meet the high demands for demos. We believe HPE Private Cloud AI is going to be an important growth driver for our hybrid cloud business, and we are filing numerous patents to ensure our leadership is recognized and protected. This innovation and customer interest positions HPE Hybrid Cloud well, as AI is an accelerator for hybrid cloud solutions. We are on a positive trajectory with orders and we are beginning to realize returns from an ongoing investment in both our product portfolio and our specialized sales motions. There is more work to do, but we are pleased that our revenue and profitability both improved quarter-over-quarter. Customers require new data protocols in file and object to store and manage data to train AI applications. We expect that extending our HPE Alletra Storage software-defined offerings to these new data protocols will lead to a higher proportional software and related services in our portfolio. We are seeing double-digits orders growth in HPE Alletra Storage and in HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud SaaS offerings. In just the last three months, almost 3,000 new customers began using our HPE GreenLake cloud, and we added almost 10,000 more customers in the last year. We are pleased with the momentum we are seeing with customers who have turned into HPE GreenLake. We are proud to announce a new agreement with Deloitte to utilize the HPE GreenLake cloud to help transform and centralize Deloitte's IT infrastructure, which includes AI computing. We continue to introduce new hybrid cloud offerings by adding more profitable software and services, which is clearly reflected in our ARR mix now at 71%. For example, at the end of August, we closed our acquisition of Morpheus Data. We believe this acquisition solidifies HPE's leadership position as the first vendor with a full suite of software capabilities across the hybrid cloud stack. We look forward to integrating Morpheus Data multi-cloud automation and orchestration capabilities into our HPE GreenLake cloud platform to complement the AI-driven multi-cloud and multi-vendor observability from HPE's OpsRamp acquisition and our own organic innovation. In Intelligent Edge, we believe we are beginning a market recovery as customers finished digesting previous orders post-COVID. Revenue improved sequentially on gains in services and SASE. Momentum is building and we saw sequential orders increase in all regions with particular strength in North America. On the products front, orders growth was led by wireless LAN, SASE, and data center networking products. Conversely, campus-switching products orders have been slower to recover. Last month, we reinforced HPE Aruba Networking cyber defenses with the new AI-powered network detection and response and campus-based zero trust network access. The solution leverages telemetry from HPE Aruba Networking Central's data lake to train and deploy AI models to monitor and detect unusual activity in vulnerable IoT devices, helping to support mission-critical business processes. Our security solutions are attracted to customers like Nobu Hotels, which is leveraging a secure AI power network combining the HPE Aruba Networking Central platform and HPE Aruba Networking ClearPass to implement a zero trust strategy. This installation will help provide secure, seamless and hyper-personalized guest experiences, including an AI concierge across Nobu's global footprint on luxury hotels. We are excited for what comes next with our pending Juniper Networks acquisition and the comprehensive networking profile we will create. As I have said before, we expect that Juniper will be accretive to our margin profile and non-GAAP EPS in year one. The deal recently received regulatory approvals in the European Union, UK, India, and several other jurisdictions and we remain on track to close in late calendar year 2024 or early calendar year 2025. Plans are well underway to ensure successful integration post close. To conclude, I am very pleased with our third quarter performance. Our impressive revenue growth reflects the strength of our portfolio and the growing excitement customers have for our newest innovations across AI, network and hybrid cloud. HPE is playing a crucial role in helping customers adopt this transformative technology across their business. As we innovate, we also continue to stay disciplined in the way we manage our business and cost structure. In Q3, we delivered profitable growth for our shareholders in a competitive and dynamic environment. Next month, we look forward to hosting some of you at our incredible Wisconsin manufacturing facility, where we will build many of our industry-leading direct liquid cooled AI systems. The work we do there plays a key role in driving the transition to direct liquid cooled systems and the successful AI revenue conversion we saw this quarter. I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to experience this. Now, I will hand it over to Marie to go through the segment results in greater detail. Marie? Yeah. Thank you, Toni. This is Antonio. I'm going to take the first part. The quick answer is no. There have not been very, very large deals or lumpy deals. It's been more spread and more uniform across the service provider space. And on the enterprise side, because obviously, we talk about this, the percentage of bookings relative to the $1.6 billion was -- as a mix, was in the mid-teens. So, very consistent with the prior year's quarter. However, obviously, the dollars are much larger, right, because now this quarter, we book $1.6 billion. So, I actually argue this is a good thing. And we don't expect significant super-large deals, I'd call it, in Q4 based on what we have visibility in the pipeline, but more a continuation of what we saw in Q3. And Marie, you want to talk about the free cash flow? Yeah, thanks, Mike. Yeah, listen, we are very pleased with the services attached momentum on the AI systems portion of our business, which I believe will continue to grow as we grow the enterprise segment of the market, because that segment of the market comes with more rich services day zero, day one and day two services like we call it. And yesterday was the first day it became available out of HPE Private Cloud AI, and that has quite a bit of services component with it. And so -- but right now, as we started disclosing last quarter, the services component of that which you saw in one of the slides, as Marie was providing her remarks, much of that is pretty much all deferred. So, unless we are doing an installation and that gets recognized immediately, most of that is the maintenance that gets recognized over the length of the contract. And therefore, over time, we expect that will be contributing positive to our gross margins in the segment that we recognize that revenue, which obviously is the Server segment of the market. So, yes, but I'm positive on both gross margin accretion as we recognize the revenue and more services as we start selling the HPE Private Cloud in the enterprise space. Yeah. Thank you, Simon. We have seen no signs of cannibalization into the traditional server market. And remember, I always try to bring a segment point of view, right? So, the segment point of view in the AI space, you have three segments. You have the service providers, model builders, which obviously include the hyperscalers, and there we have not sold traditional servers in a long time once we made the decision in 2017 to not participate in that market. And then, you have the sovereign space, which is now going up in term of interest, but the sales cycles are longer because of the government engagements and the procurement, but there, generally speaking, there is no traditional service per se. It's a combination of architectures and GPUs and CPUs in a unique form factor. And then last but not least, we have the enterprise. And the enterprise, while it's growing, has been very much focused on the AI applications. And for customers to move a traditional workload, call it, legacy workloads and the like, to a accelerated compute, the question is why you will do that when, A, you need to use the accelerated compute to either fine-tune the model or to do inferencing; and second, from a PCO perspective, there is no clear view that, that will be cost less. And so that's why when I think about workloads and customer segments, we don't see signs of cannibalization from the AI deployments into the traditional workloads. Yeah. So, first of all, the pipeline we have in front of us is multiples of the current backlog, which is a positive news, because that tells you the momentum will continue in the next few quarters. Second is that the backlog composition, as I said, in the mid-teens is the enterprise space and the rest is the traditional service provider space. On the service provider space is basically compute capacity to train models or to do hosting for that matter, in large colos. And then, on the enterprise space is really focused on the use cases where they see clear line of sight for the return on that investment, and there are several use cases by segment that customers by verticals that they are driving. Obviously, many of them are very obvious. And now we are seeing a little bit more sophistication in some of those use cases and the maturity of. And that's why our Private Cloud AI offering is targeting those type of customers, because ultimately comes with entire stack from the, what I call, the workloads at the top, specifically designed for the verticals, down into the training models, all the way down to the infrastructure. They are sized for that type of deployment. And then, on the sovereign AI, obviously, we see now a significant interest. We are working across multiple geos on several opportunities. A lot of them are basically to open AI clouds for sovereign reasons or privates and compliance reasons on data. And a lot of them actually want to look a little bit like supercomputers in many ways because many of those systems are designed to do both AI large language models, and that's very obvious with some of the deployments we have done in the European Union and the one we're going to do now for the U.K. And other ones are basically for traditional supercomputing. So, the infrastructure in the end is the same. All of these systems are very much liquid cooled systems. And so, that's an opportunity for us. But on the enterprise side, I think you can see now expansion from traditional bots and customer service into other areas in finance, manufacturing, marketing, where they can see the clear return on that investment. And we're helping them even upfront through a partner ecosystem to define those use cases, because ultimately, it goes beyond just deploying IT, but they're really to realize the business value. Well, I think right now, one of the key sweet spots is we now have to build and deploy and run these large systems. That requires a unique expertise. That's why you see the services portion being attached to those assistants. And ultimately, you need expertise both in the manufacturing space. And again, we're going to host our AI Day in one of, what I believe is, the largest footprints in the world where you can see how this gets done. And then, on the services side, you should not underestimate the services expertise needed to run. But for enterprise, where is the next big thing is -- in my view, is all about the simplicity. And several of the patterns we are actually filing and getting done are actually in areas like ease of use, automation, obviously, security. These are all spaces where we are actually building all those capabilities in our offer. And remember, all of this gets built inside HPE GreenLake as we deploy these optimized infrastructure and configurations. And that's why for me, GreenLake is an important component of our AI strategy, because ultimately, we manage a lot of the deployment on-prem through enterprise customers, specifically, through HPE GreenLake. And that's an accelerator and a way to upsell, cross-sell, build, ultimately, customers' confidence and control of the data, which is the fundamental value when it comes down to AI. And then, next year, once we close the Juniper transaction, we're going to add another key component, which is the networking piece. And it's very important that we recognize that AI, A, is a hybrid workload. The core foundation of that across hybrid is the network. And HPE will have unique IP and capabilities in that space in addition to the traditional server storage, which is now certified for AI, and then the GreenLake software and services attached to it. And that's how I want to think about it. Independent businesses are all accretive to AI, but then when we get to a solution, HPE will have the full-stack solution to offer to our enterprise customers. Yeah, no, thank you very much for the time. Again, I will say we delivered a strong quarter. We drove very strong revenue growth. We said what -- we did what we said. And honestly, I'm very confident about the next quarter and what comes next after the Juniper acquisition. I'm super-pleased that we also closed the first tranche of our H3C put option. Obviously, that took a lot of work in an environment that's complex. And as you think about our ability to deliver profitable growth is there. I understand the questions around margins, but when I think about margins, on the server side, we are consistently driving a stable around 11% or so operating margins. We think about that way more than gross margin because ultimately it's all about cash. And then, ultimately, on the networking and hybrid cloud is about both gross margin, because of our content is more software and services, while we'll deliver on the bottom-line. So, I think our strategy all coming together, but it's very competitive dynamic there and we have to execute every day with discipline, which is what we did again this quarter. And again, we raised guidance for the full year on the EPS side of the house. So, thank you very much for your time. And I look forward to hosting some of you at our facility in Wisconsin on October 10."

HPE delivered a very solid performance in the second quarter, with revenue and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exceeding our outlook range, driven by AI systems revenue more than doubling from our first quarter. I am very optimistic about where we're headed. AI demand continues to accelerate with cumulative AI systems orders reaching $4.6 billion this quarter. We have a robust pipeline in this business, though large AI orders can cause fluctuations during the quarter. We anticipate continued revenue growth driven by increased AI systems demand, continued adoption of HPE GreenLake, and ongoing improvement in the traditional infrastructure market, including servers, storage, and networking. Due to our confidence in the second half of fiscal year 2024, we are raising our full-year revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance and reiterating free cash flow guidance. Marie will provide more specifics in her remarks. While we focus on translating strong AI customer demand to revenue growth. We continue to drive cost discipline to operate more efficiently and to preserve the ability to make targeted investments, which will sustain our growth into the future. We are being prudent with our spending and reduce operating expenses in the first half, as compared to the prior year period. We're also driving business process simplification across the company, including through digitization and automation with AI. Demand for HPE's AI systems is accelerating at a faster pace, and our solid execution enabled us to more than double our AI systems' revenue sequentially to over $900 million, helped by supply chain conversion through improved GPU availability. Our lead time to deliver NVIDIA H100 solutions is now between six and 12 weeks, depending on order size and complexity. We expect this will provide a lift to our revenues in the second half of the year. Enterprise customer interest in AI is rapidly growing, and our sellers are seeing a higher level of engagement. Enterprise orders now comprise more than 15% of our cumulative AI systems orders, with the number of Enterprise AI customers nearly tripling year-over-year. As these engagements continue to progress from exploration and discovery phase, we anticipate additional acceleration in enterprise AI systems orders through the end of the fiscal year.\nsovereign states: HPE has decades of experience in the design, manufacture, and management of air and liquid cool systems, including the data center infrastructure to reliably deliver the highest levels of computing performance. Customers appreciate our AI at scale expertise and intellectual property, as well as unique liquid cooling manufacturing and services capabilities. As accelerated computing, silicon innovation advances, higher power density demands direct liquid cooling technologies. Building direct liquid cooling AI systems is complex and requires manufacturing expertise and infrastructure, including power, cooling, and water. With more than 300 HPE patents in direct liquid cooling, proven expertise and significant manufacturing capacity for this kind of systems, HPE is well-positioned to help customers meet the power demands for current and future accelerated compute silicon designs. Our leadership in AI was once again validated in May, when the latest top 500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers was released. HPE now has four of the top 10 world's fastest supercomputers, all of which are direct liquid cooled. Two of these systems are exascale supercomputers, with frontier still the world's fastest and [Aruba] (ph) now breaking the exascale barrier. I'm also proud that we have built seven of the world's top 10 energy efficient systems, according to the latest Green 500 list. This experience makes us an attractive partner to sovereign states and government pursuing AI strategies. HPE benefits from a strong ecosystem of AI partners, including NVIDIA. We introduced co-engineered enterprise solutions with NVIDIA last year to streamline the model development process, as well as to enable enterprises to fine-tune large language models with their private data to accelerate inferencing. I'm excited that NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang will Join me at HPE Discover Las Vegas in just two weeks. Together, we will unveil new, exciting, and differentiated innovations that will simplify and accelerate enterprise AI adoption and deployment. Enterprise customers are already responding to our unique AI portfolio. For example, [QBox] (ph), a facial and image recognition company in Korea, is developing new generative AI models using HPE AI systems to enhance identity verifications at locations such as the Incheon International Airport in South Korea. JT Group, based in Japan, operates a pharmaceutical business and is planning to use our HPE AI systems to support AI model training and simulations to accelerate drug discovery. And we just announced that we will power Scaleway\u2019s AI cloud service offering using our HPE AI systems. The new service will make powerful computing accessible to companies to support their various AI workloads and use cases. As we capitalize on the AI growth opportunity, we also see indications of the market recovery in traditional and cloud infrastructure markets, orders for traditional service grew sequentially, and year-over-year, driven by enterprise public sector and SMB customers in North America and Europe. We are seeing no indication of cannibalization from accelerated computing demand. And revenue grew sequentially as customers transitioned to higher AUP HPE ProLiant Gen11 servers. Differentiated customer-centric innovation positions as well to capture this market recovery. For example, our leading HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud is attracting new customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the number of customer organizations using HPE GreenLake increased sequentially by almost 9% to 34,000. And our as-a-service lifetime total contract value grew to more than $15 billion in Q2, with our annualized revenue run rate, or ARR growing 39% year-over-year. Demand is increasing for our HPE GreenLake on-premise private cloud solutions. The Defense Information Systems Agency, a combat support agency of the United States Department of Defense, selected HPE to develop a distributed hybrid multi-cloud platform prototype on HPE GreenLake, as part of an effort to simplify the organization's management of disparate IT infrastructure and resources across public and private clouds. In storage, we accelerated the transition of our portfolio in Q2 to meet the needs of hybrid cloud and AI. Several weeks ago, HPE introduced significant new functionality to our HPE Alletra storage offerings. We rounded out our block offering by extending the hybrid capabilities of HPE Alletra block storage to AWS, doubling its capacity to address more customers and enhancing its automation capabilities with generative AI. Early this quarter, we introduced new HPE GreenLake for file storage capabilities with options specifically targeting the unstructured data demands of AI. We have also added significant specialist sales capacity in recent months. While it takes time to activate new sellers and bring them to full productivity in a market with long sell cycles. We expect increased order-to-revenue conversion in the future. The enhancement to our winning portfolio complemented by a more focused sales force positioned HPE to strengthen the already robust customer adoption of HPE Alletra. More than 1,000 new HPE Alletra MP systems have been deployed to date, which is the fastest product ramp in the history of our company. In networking, the market remained in transition during the quarter, as customers continued to work through their current inventory. As demand in this segment gradually returns, we believe our broad portfolio positions as well. We expect modest sequential networking demand improvement driven by the state and local purchasing season in the United States. We announced significant new innovations during the quarter to align with HPE's broader AI strategy. These solutions include Generated AI capabilities to improve AI Ops and WiFi 7 access points that capture edge data for AI inferencing. In addition, last month we launched new security and AI observability tools to help fight AI cyber risks. And just yesterday, we expanded the most complete private 5G and Wi-Fi portfolio in the market with the launch of HPE Aruba Networking Enterprise Private 5G. All of this will be delivered through our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Customers are responding to our networking innovation. In the last few months, customers ranging from Houston Airport to [Baptist] (ph) Health Group to Mercedes-Benz Stadium to the University of Maryland have turned to HPE to enhance the experience for the visitors, residents, and employees. As we look to our future in networking, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the proposed acquisition of Juniper networks. We're currently in the regulatory process for this transaction and expect to close by the end of 2024 or early 2025. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in innovation while we drive operational and cost discipline to continue to improve our cost structure. We are focused on reducing complexity in our business processes, as well as implementing automation and AI across the company to enhance customer service, R&D productivity, and team member overall experience. I also want to note that we recently announced we have restructured the sale of our stake in H3C. Since the transaction is large and complex, the required regulatory approvals were taken longer than previously anticipated. So, we agreed to restructure the sale with units. The updated agreement provides HPE with the opportunity to sell a significant portion of the shares in the coming months. The new payment structure has no impact on the pending Juniper Networks transaction, as the structure of the deal financing does not rely on any of the H3C proceeds. Finally, you likely saw that we announced in May that we have agreed to divest our communications technology group to enhance our strategic focus in high growth, high margin parts of the market, including the service provider and enterprise markets. In closing, I want to reiterate that I'm proud of the very solid performance in Q2. It shows the alignment of our strategy and innovation to major market opportunities. We have greater optimism about the second half of the year, leading us to raise our full year revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. AI is creating growing demand across our portfolio, and we see significant opportunities across customer and business segments. Our competitive advantages, from deep expertise in standing up AI systems to our differentiated HPE GreenLake Cloud to our networking storage offerings position as well. We have an excellent team, and I'm confident in our ability to continue executing with discipline to take advantage of incredible opportunities presented by this era of innovation. I am looking forward to sharing with you our latest breakthrough innovation and partnerships across AI, hybrid cloud and networking later this month at HPE Discover Las Vegas. We are very excited to be the first corporate keynote at Sphere, and I hope to see many of you there. I would like now to hand it over to Marie, who will talk about the details of our segments and our outlook. Marie, over to you.\nMarie Myers : Thank you, Antonio, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with all of you after my first full quarter as HPE's CFO. Over the past three months, I have become even more excited about our opportunities across AI, hybrid cloud, and networking. We remain in the very early days of AI, yet it is already driving strong interest, pipeline, orders, and revenue across our portfolio from service to storage to services to financing. Our AI system revenue inflected positively in Q2. We are winning deals in the AI market now and are well positioned for additional demand from enterprises and software into the future. Our differentiation includes decades of liquid cooling expertise, which we expect to become even more in demand with future iterations of chips, including NVIDIAs. In short, we see AI as a long-term driver of our financial results and as a pillar of our strategy to pursue higher growth, higher margin revenues. We are very pleased that we have exceeded our expectations in Q2 across key metrics. We exceeded the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $400 million. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS was above the high end of our range, and free cash flow exceeded $600 million. Improving Enterprise demand for traditional servers on top of the expected sharp ramp in AI servers drove the outperformance. Our AI orders, a healthy, intelligent edge, is set to grow sequentially beyond Q2 as expected, and AI emerged as a driver of a healthy HPE GreenLake momentum. We are seeing rapid growth in AI system revenue. Overall, I am very pleased with our performance in Q2 and am excited about our continued progress through Fiscal 2024. Let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter in constant currency to $7.2 billion. This exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance by approximately $400 million. We have strong momentum in HPE GreenLake. The number of customers that have adopted HPE GreenLake rose 9% sequentially. ARR grew 39% year-over-year to above $1.5 billion in Q2. Storage and networking are typically the fastest growth elements of ARR and both retain robust growth rates. This quarter, AI was the fastest growth component of ARR. Our software and services mix rose approximately 200 basis points year-over-year to 67%. ARR is the best indicator of our model transformation to our as-a-service offerings. This growth validates what our customers are telling us, that HPE GreenLake is a key differentiator. We expect HPE GreenLake's value proposition to key customers, including enterprises and sovereigns, to sharpen with the advent of AI. Our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 33.1%, which was down 310 basis points sequentially and year-over-year, driven by a mix shift from our higher margin Intelligent Edge revenue to Server revenue, plus an unfavorable mix within hybrid cloud. At Q2, non-GAAP operating expenses fell 1.6% year-over-year, despite our revenue growth of 4%. Our OpEx discipline partially offset lower non-GAAP gross margins and held the non-GAAP operating margin decline to 200 basis points sequentially and year-over-year to 9.5%. The OpEx discipline plus higher revenue drove GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.24 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42. The latter exceeded the high end of the guidance range on strong revenue and cost discipline. And non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes $247 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisitions, and other related challenges. We are managing the business with focus and discipline and evolving into a simpler, more agile company. We are also investing to capitalize on growth from the interrelated inflection points of AI, hybrid cloud, and networking and to drive structurally higher profitability over time. Let's turn to our segment results. Server revenues were $3.9 billion in the quarter. This was up 16% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year. Strengths in both AI systems and traditional servers drove the healthy revenue growth. Our cumulative AI system product and service orders since Q1 2023, rose approximately $600 million sequentially to $4.6 billion. I am very pleased with our AI system product revenue more than doubled sequentially to over $900 million. This strong revenue growth allowed us to make progress against our backlog, which is now $3.1 billion. Given the growing importance of our services business, we have updated our AI disclosures for this quarter to include services. Services is a small portion of our AI systems metrics at present, though we expect it to become more meaningful over time. Our differentiation with liquid cooling, software, HPE GreenLake and increasingly, services is resonating in the market. We have seen a threefold increase in our enterprise AI customer base in the past year. Revenue from our traditional server business increased sequentially. We expect this trend to continue. Demand is improving, as enterprises digest prior purchases and gain more comfort with the macro outlook. Structural mix shift to higher AUP Gen11 servers is ahead of our expectations, and we are able to pass-through rising input costs. We are encouraged that our Gen11 pipeline is starting to include AI inferencing activity and enterprise applications, and we see more evidence of adoption in the enterprise in Q2. Our Q2 operating margin was 11%. This was down 40 basis points sequentially and was in-line with the expectations we laid out last quarter for our operating margins [near] (ph) the lower-end of our long-term 11% to 13% range. While pricing remains aggressive in the server market, particularly in AI systems, we remain disciplined in cost and price, as we pursue profitable growth. Hybrid cloud revenues of $1.3 billion were up 1% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year. We are already seeing some cross-selling benefits of integrating the majority of our HPE GreenLake offering into a single business unit. I mentioned a 39% growth in ARR this quarter. Our traditional storage business was down year-over-year. The business is managing two long-term transitions at once. We talked about our migration to the more software-intensive Alletra platform. This is reducing current period revenue growth, so locking in future recurring revenue. Storage ARR growth of over 50% year-over-year offers early confidence into the migration. The second transition is from block storage to file storage driven by AI. While early, this is also on the right trajectory. Our new file offerings plus the sales force investment Antonio mentioned tripled our pipeline of file storage deals sequentially in Q2. Our operating margin was 0.8%, which was down 300 basis points sequentially and 110 basis points year-over-year. Reduced revenue scale and an unfavorable mix of third-party products and traditional storage was the largest driver of the sequential change. Intelligent Edge revenues were $1.1 billion. Revenues fell 9% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. Backlog consumption created difficult compares with both prior periods. Our backlog is now at normal levels. The demand environment remains soft and large enterprises have yet to return to the market in force. However, we do see some green shoots that give us confidence in networking will transition to modest sequential growth beyond Q2, as we had expected. Our channel inventory remains within the normal range. Wi-Fi has grown sequentially for two consecutive quarters. Growth remains strong in software and services. Attach rates and renewals for Aruba Central, SASE and our AIOps software remains strong. The Intelligent Edge portfolio of subscription revenue grew above 50% year-over-year. The segment operating margin of 21.8% was down 760 basis points sequentially and 290 basis points year-over-year. As expected, the lower revenues, reduced mix of switching business and the less revenue from backlog were the primary drivers. As we indicated last quarter, we have reset our OpEx plan for the year to account for lower revenue and expect the Intelligent Edge, operating margin to be back in the mid-20% range by Q4. Our HPE Financial Services revenue was up 1% year-over-year, and financing volume was $1.7 billion. Our operating margin of 9.3% was up 80 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year. Our Q2 loss ratio remained steady below 0.5%. These results are what we have come to expect from this high-quality, predictable business. However, underneath these steady results, FS is already adapting to drive AI growth across the business. Year-to-date, nearly $0.5 billion of our $3 billion in financing volume went to AI wins with both cloud and enterprise customers. This illustrates our prior point that AI is driving demand to every one of our businesses. Turning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations and $610 million in free cash flow this quarter. HPE typically consumes significant amount of cash in the first half of the year and then generates cash in the second half. We are ahead of traditional free cash flow patterns thus far in fiscal 2024, given higher than expected net income in Q2, prepayments for AI systems, and timing of working capital payments. Our cash conversion cycle was negative four days, which is a reduction of 28 days from Q2 '23. Our days of inventory and days payable were both higher to support our expected growth in AI system revenue in the second half. We returned $240 million in capital to shareholders in Q2, including $169 million in dividends and $45 million in share repurchases. Our year-to-date capital return is $386 million. Let's turn now to our forward view. We expect a materially stronger second half led by AI systems, traditional servers, and storage, networking and HPE GreenLake. Let me recap the key drivers that factor into our expectations for Q3 and the full year. For server, we expect improving GPU supply for AI systems and improving demand for traditional servers to drive sequential revenue increases through fiscal year 2024. While the rising AI systems mix is a gross margin headwind, we are balancing this with higher-margin services revenue, improving scale and cost discipline. We expect the segment operating margin to be approximately 11% for the fiscal year. For hybrid cloud, we expect slight sequential revenue increases throughout the year. HPE GreenLake growth should continue and traditional storage should improve slightly. We expect operating margin to improve modestly to the mid-single-digit range through the year as HPE GreenLake deals mature, new products ramp, and our sales force optimization gathers momentum. For Intelligent Edge, we anticipate a slight sequential growth in Q3 and Q4, driven primarily by seasonal education spending rather than improving markets. We continue to expect our cost reduction efforts to materialize in the second half and our full year operating margin to be in the mid-20% range. With that context, let me now turn to our outlook. For Q3, we expect revenues in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.29 and $0.34, and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.43 and $0.48. For fiscal year 2024, we now expect constant currency revenue growth of 1% to 3%, which is up from our prior 0% to 2% range. We reiterate our non-GAAP operating profit growth guidance of 0% to 2%. We are reducing our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance by $0.20 to $1.61 to $1.71 to incorporate the recent updates to our H3C proceeds. We are raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance up $0.03 to $1.85 to $1.95. This incremental $0.03 or $0.06 annualized reflects the contribution from the retained portion of our H3C stake. We are also increasingly comfortable with the high-end of the non-GAAP diluted net EPS range, given our OI&E and operational improvement. We are excluding from our non-GAAP results the gain on sale from our H3C and CTG divestments. This year's mix shift from networking to AI systems should weigh on our gross margins. We expect the fiscal '24 non-GAAP gross margin to be below our full year expectation of 35% from our Analyst Day. To balance the mix shift, we are driving further simplicity and efficiency across the business. We are accelerating our generative AI capabilities such as implementing HPE-specific large language models and chatbots for our sales and service representatives. As I mentioned last quarter, prudent cost management, simplified processes, and disciplined execution across cycles are key tenets of our long-term journey towards higher margins. These cost actions will be evident in financial results in the second half of fiscal '24. We now expect fiscal year '24 OpEx to be down modestly from fiscal '23 OpEx. Our prior view was flat to down. This includes a sequential increase in Q3 for marketing before a sequentially lower Q4, which will serve us well heading into fiscal '25. We expect our fiscal '24 operating margin to be flattish year-over-year. We now expect OI&E to be less of a headwind this year. We anticipate $150 million headwind versus our prior expectation of a $200 million to $250 million headwind, given a one-time benefit in Q2 and the retained portion of our H3C stake. We expect the effect of currency to be immaterial. Our strong first half free cash flow increases our confidence that we will deliver at least $1.9 billion in fiscal year '24. We expect significantly stronger free cash flow in the second half of the year led by higher earnings, given our ramp in AI systems. This does not include the $2.1 billion that we expect to receive from Unisplendour this fiscal year, as a result of our recently restructured agreement to sell our stake in H3C. We expect working capital to be neutral to free cash flow as we expect declines in inventory to balance declines in accounts payable. We remain committed in the long-term to our balanced capital allocation framework, including our target of returning 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders. In the near term, we expect to continue share repurchases at a pace in line with Q2 as we prudently manage our balance sheet, ahead of the anticipated receipt of the H3C proceeds and the Juniper transaction closing. The proposed Juniper deal remains on track to close in late 2024 or early '25 as planned. We remain committed to our dividend and to our investment grade rating. To conclude, our solid Q2 results illustrate how comprehensively AI is affecting our portfolio. We are capturing profitable growth opportunities in the AI market. We are excited to discover and look forward to seeing many of you at our IR Summit. I'll open it up now for your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. And congrats on a nice sprint. I guess my question is really on the AI system side. You folks obviously had some really good revenue performance here. I think business pretty much doubled sequentially. I'm hoping you could spend some time talking about how should we think about margins on the AI side versus maybe segment averages because your margins appear to be holding up a lot better versus they have done at Dell or Super Micro, for example. So I'd love to just understand how do we think about AI system margins versus corporate averages? And if you just touch on what do you think differentiates your AI solutions versus companies like Super Micro, Dell, that'll be super helpful. Thank you.\nMarie Myers: Hi Amit, good afternoon. it's Marie, and happy to take the question. And look, obviously, we shipped $900 million of AI revenue in the quarter. And I think as you saw, our margin rate on our service segment from an operating profit perspective was 11%. So look, honestly as the CFO, very pleased that's what we guided and that's what we achieved, and that's what we've guided for the second half of the year. In terms of what's the puts and takes and the headwinds and tailwinds, let me give you some color around it. So from a headwind perspective, obviously we're dealing with a tougher inflationary commodity market, particularly even in the second half. And we also see, as you saw in the quarter, a greater mix of AI servers actually in our overall server mix. And as you know and you've heard, it's a pretty competitive market out there I might add, too. But clearly, we're managing it very well. And I'd say what's benefiting us is a couple of really important tailwinds. One is what we are seeing in terms of the Gen11 transition. That part of the business brings a higher AUP. And then also frankly, Amit it's the work we're doing around cost. So as a result, I think this really illustrates that we are very disciplined around both price and cost and frankly, it's part of our strategy to drive profitable growth. So pleased with the results, and that's how we are guiding the back half of the year, Amit.\nAntonio Neri: So Amit, on the differentiation, I will summarize this on four key elements. One is our ability to deliver and run systems at scale, so AI system scale, that's a unique expertise and we have decades of experience. Number two is our infrastructure cooling intellectual property. We actually have all the IP necessary to cool systems in three different ways for them other. Our manufacturing footprint, which is very unique. We have one of the largest water-cooled manufacturing footprints in the world with two very important locations in the US and in Europe, which are close to customers. And then last but not least is services. What I think people are coming to realize that running the system of scale requires unique services capabilities. And that's why with Marie, we started showing you what the services pull-through is, which is also over time, a lever to improve the gross margin in this business. And we cover all aspects from day zero which consulting, to day one, which is advisory and professional services design and then -- and build, and then day 2, which is a running part with our -- in our operational services side and deep expertise when it comes down to this system of scale, including direct liquid cooling. All those four key elements are a big differentiation for us.\nJeff Kvaal : Thank you Amit. We move to the next question.\nOperator: And the next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess sticking on the AI topic, if I could first ask, when you referenced the AI enterprise customers starting to show up, and I think the comment on the conference call was, it's now north of 15% of your AI orders. Can you give a little bit of more context of that? What has that been over the last couple of quarters? I'm just trying to think about the trajectory of that. And then Antonio, on the liquid cooling side, as we and investors think about Blackwell product cycle from NVIDIA, I'm curious of, can you be a little bit more specific of exactly where, from a technology perspective, you differentiate at liquid cooling? Is there something unique that HPE does within the 300 patents that you would want to highlight for us, as sustainably differentiated. Thank you.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Thanks, Aaron. I think it's fair to say that the enterprise demand has started to pick in Q1 and really accelerate in Q2. Early on, if you go back to the Q1 2023 all the way to, call it, calendar 2023, a lot of demand came from the model builders, the service providers, and hyperscalers and you see the reference to our partner, Microsoft. But as I think about that, I think three segments of the market. I think about [dark segment] (ph), which is driving a lot of demand for a lot of GPUs and accelerated compute in general. The second segment is sovereign clouds and that starts to pick up now. And that's, think about tens of customers around the globe because obviously, our countries. And then there is enterprise customers, which will be thousands of customers over time. So today, we are very pleased with the momentum in enterprise AI. A lot of the conversations are happening. I was in Europe the last two weeks and I was in London, I was in Paris, I was in Madrid. All of them want to adopt AI. And I think they are attracted to HPE because of the trust, the quality, and the ability to deliver a simplified experience to our HPE GreenLake platform. As for the differentiation, HPE has three different ways to cool systems. So one is the traditional way, which is called the liquid-to-air cooler, think about that, basically running water supply in chilled locations where basically cools the air around the systems. Everybody has done that for a long time. The second is what most of the industry is doing today, which is what I call 70% direct liquid cooling or hybrid liquid cooling. Those companies still use fans to cool aspects of the systems. Some of our competitors talk about direct liquid cooling, but that's exactly what they're doing, and they are doing only a hybrid direct liquid cooling. And HPE has -- and by the way, in that environment, we have 10 systems already in market today that we are shipping and configuring for customers. And then we have what I call 100% direct liquid cooling. And this is a unique differentiation HPE has because we have been doing 100% direct liquid cooling for a long time. And today, there are six systems in deployment, and three of them are for generative AI. And as we go to the next generation of the silicon and you talk about Blackwell, when you go to the B200, that will require 100% direct liquid cooling. And that's a unique opportunity for us because you need not only the IP and the capabilities to cool the infrastructure but also the manufacturing side. And that's why I said early on to the previous call, that HPE has one of the largest water-cooled manufacturing capabilities. So that is what really differentiate us. And even on the hybrid way to cool the system, HPE is not using off-the-shelf solution. We use what we call an ARC, which stands for adaptive rack cooling system, is a unique design. And the good news is that we can actually colocate in the same data center and in the same aisle, direct liquid cooling and air-cooled systems, which is unique because customers don't want to retrofit data center. So that's the opportunity.\nJeff Kvaal: Aaron, thank you very much, Gary.\nOperator: The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMary Lenox: Hi, this is Mary on for Meta. I just had a question for you on Intelligent Edge. Where are you in the Intelligent Edge inventory digestion and when do you expect to emerge from it?\nMarie Myers: Yes. Good afternoon. And in terms of where we're at Intelligent Edge, I think as I commented in my prepared remarks, we saw Q2 as being the trough period, and we've been transitioning through that throughout the quarter. And if you look at the market and where it's at right now, I'd say, that our channel inventory right now is in really good shape. And we did mention in the guide that we do expect a modest sequential improvement in networking in the back-half of the year.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. And I will say in addition to what Marie said, what I'm really excited is that we see interesting areas of growth happening now. If you go back to Mobile World Congress and you see even announcements like we made yesterday, the enterprise private 5G is picking up significant momentum. Of my almost 40 meetings I had in Barcelona, more than half were about enterprise private 5G. And so yesterday, we announced the most complete enterprise private 5G on the back of the Athonet acquisition.\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks very much Mary, Gary.\nOperator: The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes, good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on the guidance. You talked about enthusiasm for the second half, but you beat revenues this quarter relative to your expectations by $400 million and by guiding up an additional percent, you're actually only guiding up the full year by $300 million. So I'm wondering, are you just being conservative, given the commentary around enthusiasm and forces at work in the second half or how do we reconcile that discrepancy? And then also just on AI servers for the second half, I think you talked about six-week to 12-week lead times. So if you have $3 billion in backlog and lead times for six weeks to 12 weeks, why can't you deliver $3 billion in AI systems like next quarter or certainly in the second half? Thank you.\nMarie Myers: Yes. Hi Toni, good afternoon. So this is Marie. I'm going to take the first question just on the guide. So let me just clarify the guidance in terms of how we put it together. So we raised the guide from -- to $1.85 to $1.95, and that actually was the pass-through on that 19% stake in H3C. So we actually put $0.03 related to the 19% stake. What I did point to though, Toni, is I pointed to the higher end of the range, so that's really what's giving us confidence based on the increase that we made on revenue. So you're seeing that higher top-line and then also the confidence I got around just the cost discipline. So you've seen that just in the last couple of quarters where we've had a really strong scrutiny and focus around OpEx. And plus we did have some favorability in OI&E this quarter, that [beats] (ph) \u2013 that was actually just a onetime. So I just want to make that point of clarification. So overall, Toni, keeping the guide at $1.85 to $1.95 but really pointing to the higher end of the guide in terms of just the confidence that you articulated. So I'll turn it over to Antonio to cover the second question.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. Toni, I think there is an opportunity to potentially exceed that. I think the limiting factor is not the supply, to be honest with you, is the availability of data center space. I made this comment in Q1, if you recall, data center space and power and cooling. And so some -- we are working with the customers to time everything correctly, six to 12 weeks, think about it, maybe less than a quarter, but then you have to go and install it. And there is a nice percentage of our deals in generative AI, which are all actually GreenLake. And so while we can recognize the revenue upfront, we are deferring all the services piece of it. So it really is going to come down to the timing of the data center and the power and cooling. And if that all aligns correctly, then we may have an opportunity to do better. But we felt prudent at this point in time to keep it the way it is and raising by 1%.\nJeff Kvaal: Toni, thanks very much, Gary.\nOperator: The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Cardoso: Hi, thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. So maybe just following up on the AI questions. You're seeing a sequential decline in AI backlog this quarter, admittedly off of a very robust revenue quarter. But maybe you can just discuss the pipeline you're seeing. And sitting here, like what are some of the puts and takes that investors should be considering when seeing the sequential decline in backlog despite what appears to be a strong underlying demand environment overall? Thanks.\nAntonio Neri: Sure. Thank you. Yes, our backlog was slightly down quarter-over-quarter, also was based on the demand we took in and also the fact that we converted more. I think you have to realize some of these deals, particularly larger deals take time and a little bit lump. Some of them have to go through the financing side. And so we feel good about where we are today. But in terms of the pipeline, think about multiples of the current backlog, multiples of the current backlog. So as we go through the next weeks and quarters here, we feel very confident in our ability to capture that AI for all the reasons I described before, and also the ability to close these deals as some of them may include, by the way, the need to provide data center space as well because we are not just building the system. And these are all generative AI systems, by the way, all of them that we also need to run it for customers.\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks very much Joe, Gary.\nOperator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nVictor Chiu: This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. The doubling the AI system's revenue is a pretty sharp inflection this quarter. Can you just tell us how much of the increase was driven by allocation improvement versus ability to ship orders? And kind of just help us understand the dynamic there a little bit.\nAntonio Neri: No, I don't think it has to do anything with location. I read all this thing about location. We have a fantastic partnership with NVIDIA is about lead times in the general H100, which obviously NVIDIA made significant improvements on their own. And then obviously, as we start ramping our manufacturing processes, we actually become better and better at the revenue conversion. And I would say, I want to thank my team because my team did a fantastic job and we feel good about as we go forward. So it's a combination of multiple things, better lead times on supply. We feel pretty good about the ability to deliver systems 6 to 12 weeks to Toni's question, and some of them are straightforward is just shipments and some are with our HPE GreenLake offering wrapped around.\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks very much Victor, Gary.\nOperator: The next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thanks for taking questions. It's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Can you talk about how much of the GreenLake revenue and ARR growth came from AI? And then Antonio, do you think that having GreenLake is helping you sell AI systems? And I also wanted to clarify, Antonio, you talked about sovereign AI. Can you talk about what innings you're in? And are there specific requirements of sovereign AI where you think HPE is well positioned to satisfy?\nMarie Myers: Hi Ruplu, we look forward to seeing you tomorrow. So in terms of your question around just ARR and AI, actually, it was the fastest growth element of ARR in Q2, followed by storage and networking. So I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are starting to see AI to sort of move through our entire portfolio. So pleased with the progress that we had this quarter, and I'll turn it over to Antonio to add some more context.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. On the second part of the question, I think we are early at this point in time. I think there is more to be seen. And I want to make sure I captured exactly what you said. Can you repeat the last part because you were a little bit breaking.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Yes, I just wanted to ask about sovereign AI. What innings are you in, and are there specific requirements that you can satisfy?\nAntonio Neri: Yes. So on sovereign AI, I said it's early, early on. I think there is a lot of engagements right now happening at the country level. The good news, we have very good reach across the board. And it's a combination of both. There is a combination of providing what I call generative AI locations where customers, enterprise customers can get access to -- to a sovereign cloud that the government may be helping funding at the same time. And the other one is what I call supercomputing power, right, itself. And so the two are very well aligned to the sovereign AI opportunities. And that's why I'm excited because HPE already provides to a lot of the sovereign governments supercomputing. So now we can extend into generative AI. If you think about the example of the UK Bristol is a generative AI system that the UK is funding as a part of the Bristol University, that the venture is going to be open to start-ups and enterprises in the UK, to either train models or do other type of research. And that's what we see.\nJeff Kvaal: Okay. Thanks very much Ruplu. Gary, we have two more questions, please.\nOperator: And the next question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Hi, good afternoon guys. Really appreciate, taking the question. Just a quick clarification and a quick question, Antonio. Did you say that in the last 12 months, AI growth was driven by service providers? And was it mobile, you said? And then the question is, what's a good way to think about cloud, your gen AI cloud scale opportunity, hyperscalers and Tier 2s going forward? Thanks a lot.\nAntonio Neri: Yes. No, thank you. I said that the segment where we have seen, obviously the vast majority of action and demand is the model builders. Those are the big companies that build large and small language models. Obviously, you saw our comments about our partner with Microsoft and the extension of their capacity to OpenAI. That's an example of a model builder. But also there are other service providers. And in fact, in my remarks, I mentioned Scaleway, which is a French service provider that provides the capacity for the local French model builders. In fact, there is a lot -- there is a very vibrant ecosystem in France about building AI models that will use that capacity to train the models. That's what I referred to at this point in time. And that's what we see and that's what we've seen. So we are very interested in not just the model builders but Tier 2, Tier 3, which also is going to be a big driver. But understanding that enterprise, ultimately what the action is going to happen in terms of fine-tuning and deploying these AI models over time.\nJeff Kvaal: Okay. Thank you very much Ananda. And last question, Gary.\nOperator: And the last question is from Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa. Please go ahead.\nLouis Miscioscia: So thanks for getting me in. my question is really about GPU or accelerated diversification. Obviously, AMD and Intel and others are starting to come out. So as you think about calendar 2024, when do you think that your system will be for this? And what do you think demand will be and then maybe continue that into 2025?\nAntonio Neri: Yes. I mean, listen, I'm very pragmatic about these things. Today, in generative AI, the market leader is NVIDIA. And that's where we have aligned our strategy, that's where we have aligned our offerings. And as I made my remarks earlier, we have 10 systems already in the mixed cooling environment and six systems or six offers also in the direct liquid cooling environment. So we are aligning with NVIDIA today, and that's why you are going to see at Discover, Jensen coming on stage with me to talk about what we're doing together. Now when you go into the sovereign space where there may be some components of supercomputing down the road, obviously, they designed their own systems with our help, and that will be a mixed environment. But just in the last month or so, we opened a new system in the Los Alamos laboratory, which was actually an NVIDIA system with HPE and is direct liquid cooled, so we are clear about that. But then there are also systems that will come in 2025 that may have different type of accelerators. Over time, we are going to be time to market. But right now, we have aligned to NVIDIA and that's what we're doing. And that's why I think it will be a great opportunity for you to join us at HPE Discover because you can see everything we talked today on the floor. Every system I just referred to my slides, every comment I made in my answers to the questions, you can come and see it. These are systems and IP that we are shipping today and you're going to see our time to market with this silicon in addition to all the services in HPE GreenLake. So it's going to be an amazing opportunity also because we are doing the keynote at Sphere, we're going to have probably inside, The Sphere more than 17,000 customers and partners joining us. So I know we don't have a lot of -- the normal time for questions, but I will say thank you for joining today. As a recap, the quarter was very solid. Our AI system revenue more than doubled to $900 million, allowing us to obviously exceed our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. Because the demand in AI is strong, we have a multiple of -- in the backlog, in our pipeline and some aspects of the traditional infrastructure market is recovering, plus our disciplined execution on pricing and cost, we are raising both the revenue and EPS guidance. And on the revenue, there could be something more obviously, but it's depending on some of the timing. And then obviously on the EPS, we are comfortable with the higher end of the range, as Marie said. So again, we are very pleased. We feel the second half is going to set up really well. And then obviously, we are looking forward to see many of you at HPE Discover in just less than two weeks. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

            "content": "HPE has decades of experience in the design, manufacture, and management of air and liquid cool systems, including the data center infrastructure to reliably deliver the highest levels of computing performance. Customers appreciate our AI at scale expertise and intellectual property, as well as unique liquid cooling manufacturing and services capabilities. As accelerated computing, silicon innovation advances, higher power density demands direct liquid cooling technologies. Building direct liquid cooling AI systems is complex and requires manufacturing expertise and infrastructure, including power, cooling, and water. With more than 300 HPE patents in direct liquid cooling, proven expertise and significant manufacturing capacity for this kind of systems, HPE is well-positioned to help customers meet the power demands for current and future accelerated compute silicon designs. Our leadership in AI was once again validated in May, when the latest top 500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers was released. HPE now has four of the top 10 world's fastest supercomputers, all of which are direct liquid cooled. Two of these systems are exascale supercomputers, with frontier still the world's fastest and [Aruba] (ph) now breaking the exascale barrier. I'm also proud that we have built seven of the world's top 10 energy efficient systems, according to the latest Green 500 list. This experience makes us an attractive partner to sovereign states and government pursuing AI strategies. HPE benefits from a strong ecosystem of AI partners, including NVIDIA. We introduced co-engineered enterprise solutions with NVIDIA last year to streamline the model development process, as well as to enable enterprises to fine-tune large language models with their private data to accelerate inferencing. I'm excited that NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang will Join me at HPE Discover Las Vegas in just two weeks. Together, we will unveil new, exciting, and differentiated innovations that will simplify and accelerate enterprise AI adoption and deployment. Enterprise customers are already responding to our unique AI portfolio. For example, [QBox] (ph), a facial and image recognition company in Korea, is developing new generative AI models using HPE AI systems to enhance identity verifications at locations such as the Incheon International Airport in South Korea. JT Group, based in Japan, operates a pharmaceutical business and is planning to use our HPE AI systems to support AI model training and simulations to accelerate drug discovery. And we just announced that we will power Scaleway's AI cloud service offering using our HPE AI systems. The new service will make powerful computing accessible to companies to support their various AI workloads and use cases. As we capitalize on the AI growth opportunity, we also see indications of the market recovery in traditional and cloud infrastructure markets, orders for traditional service grew sequentially, and year-over-year, driven by enterprise public sector and SMB customers in North America and Europe. We are seeing no indication of cannibalization from accelerated computing demand. And revenue grew sequentially as customers transitioned to higher AUP HPE ProLiant Gen11 servers. Differentiated customer-centric innovation positions as well to capture this market recovery. For example, our leading HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud is attracting new customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the number of customer organizations using HPE GreenLake increased sequentially by almost 9% to 34,000. And our as-a-service lifetime total contract value grew to more than $15 billion in Q2, with our annualized revenue run rate, or ARR growing 39% year-over-year. Demand is increasing for our HPE GreenLake on-premise private cloud solutions. The Defense Information Systems Agency, a combat support agency of the United States Department of Defense, selected HPE to develop a distributed hybrid multi-cloud platform prototype on HPE GreenLake, as part of an effort to simplify the organization's management of disparate IT infrastructure and resources across public and private clouds. In storage, we accelerated the transition of our portfolio in Q2 to meet the needs of hybrid cloud and AI. Several weeks ago, HPE introduced significant new functionality to our HPE Alletra storage offerings. We rounded out our block offering by extending the hybrid capabilities of HPE Alletra block storage to AWS, doubling its capacity to address more customers and enhancing its automation capabilities with generative AI. Early this quarter, we introduced new HPE GreenLake for file storage capabilities with options specifically targeting the unstructured data demands of AI. We have also added significant specialist sales capacity in recent months. While it takes time to activate new sellers and bring them to full productivity in a market with long sell cycles. We expect increased order-to-revenue conversion in the future. The enhancement to our winning portfolio complemented by a more focused sales force positioned HPE to strengthen the already robust customer adoption of HPE Alletra. More than 1,000 new HPE Alletra MP systems have been deployed to date, which is the fastest product ramp in the history of our company. In networking, the market remained in transition during the quarter, as customers continued to work through their current inventory. As demand in this segment gradually returns, we believe our broad portfolio positions as well. We expect modest sequential networking demand improvement driven by the state and local purchasing season in the United States. We announced significant new innovations during the quarter to align with HPE's broader AI strategy. These solutions include Generated AI capabilities to improve AI Ops and WiFi 7 access points that capture edge data for AI inferencing. In addition, last month we launched new security and AI observability tools to help fight AI cyber risks. And just yesterday, we expanded the most complete private 5G and Wi-Fi portfolio in the market with the launch of HPE Aruba Networking Enterprise Private 5G. All of this will be delivered through our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Customers are responding to our networking innovation. In the last few months, customers ranging from Houston Airport to [Baptist] (ph) Health Group to Mercedes-Benz Stadium to the University of Maryland have turned to HPE to enhance the experience for the visitors, residents, and employees. As we look to our future in networking, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the proposed acquisition of Juniper networks. We're currently in the regulatory process for this transaction and expect to close by the end of 2024 or early 2025. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in innovation while we drive operational and cost discipline to continue to improve our cost structure. We are focused on reducing complexity in our business processes, as well as implementing automation and AI across the company to enhance customer service, R&D productivity, and team member overall experience. I also want to note that we recently announced we have restructured the sale of our stake in H3C. Since the transaction is large and complex, the required regulatory approvals were taken longer than previously anticipated. So, we agreed to restructure the sale with units. The updated agreement provides HPE with the opportunity to sell a significant portion of the shares in the coming months. The new payment structure has no impact on the pending Juniper Networks transaction, as the structure of the deal financing does not rely on any of the H3C proceeds. Finally, you likely saw that we announced in May that we have agreed to divest our communications technology group to enhance our strategic focus in high growth, high margin parts of the market, including the service provider and enterprise markets. In closing, I want to reiterate that I'm proud of the very solid performance in Q2. It shows the alignment of our strategy and innovation to major market opportunities. We have greater optimism about the second half of the year, leading us to raise our full year revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. AI is creating growing demand across our portfolio, and we see significant opportunities across customer and business segments. Our competitive advantages, from deep expertise in standing up AI systems to our differentiated HPE GreenLake Cloud to our networking storage offerings position as well. We have an excellent team, and I'm confident in our ability to continue executing with discipline to take advantage of incredible opportunities presented by this era of innovation. I am looking forward to sharing with you our latest breakthrough innovation and partnerships across AI, hybrid cloud and networking later this month at HPE Discover Las Vegas. We are very excited to be the first corporate keynote at Sphere, and I hope to see many of you there. I would like now to hand it over to Marie, who will talk about the details of our segments and our outlook. Marie, over to you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Marie Myers",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with all of you after my first full quarter as HPE's CFO. Over the past three months, I have become even more excited about our opportunities across AI, hybrid cloud, and networking. We remain in the very early days of AI, yet it is already driving strong interest, pipeline, orders, and revenue across our portfolio from service to storage to services to financing. Our AI system revenue inflected positively in Q2. We are winning deals in the AI market now and are well positioned for additional demand from enterprises and software into the future. Our differentiation includes decades of liquid cooling expertise, which we expect to become even more in demand with future iterations of chips, including NVIDIAs. In short, we see AI as a long-term driver of our financial results and as a pillar of our strategy to pursue higher growth, higher margin revenues. We are very pleased that we have exceeded our expectations in Q2 across key metrics. We exceeded the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $400 million. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS was above the high end of our range, and free cash flow exceeded $600 million. Improving Enterprise demand for traditional servers on top of the expected sharp ramp in AI servers drove the outperformance. Our AI orders, a healthy, intelligent edge, is set to grow sequentially beyond Q2 as expected, and AI emerged as a driver of a healthy HPE GreenLake momentum. We are seeing rapid growth in AI system revenue. Overall, I am very pleased with our performance in Q2 and am excited about our continued progress through Fiscal 2024. Let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter in constant currency to $7.2 billion. This exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance by approximately $400 million. We have strong momentum in HPE GreenLake. The number of customers that have adopted HPE GreenLake rose 9% sequentially. ARR grew 39% year-over-year to above $1.5 billion in Q2. Storage and networking are typically the fastest growth elements of ARR and both retain robust growth rates. This quarter, AI was the fastest growth component of ARR. Our software and services mix rose approximately 200 basis points year-over-year to 67%. ARR is the best indicator of our model transformation to our as-a-service offerings. This growth validates what our customers are telling us, that HPE GreenLake is a key differentiator. We expect HPE GreenLake's value proposition to key customers, including enterprises and sovereigns, to sharpen with the advent of AI. Our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 33.1%, which was down 310 basis points sequentially and year-over-year, driven by a mix shift from our higher margin Intelligent Edge revenue to Server revenue, plus an unfavorable mix within hybrid cloud. At Q2, non-GAAP operating expenses fell 1.6% year-over-year, despite our revenue growth of 4%. Our OpEx discipline partially offset lower non-GAAP gross margins and held the non-GAAP operating margin decline to 200 basis points sequentially and year-over-year to 9.5%. The OpEx discipline plus higher revenue drove GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.24 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42. The latter exceeded the high end of the guidance range on strong revenue and cost discipline. And non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes $247 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisitions, and other related challenges. We are managing the business with focus and discipline and evolving into a simpler, more agile company. We are also investing to capitalize on growth from the interrelated inflection points of AI, hybrid cloud, and networking and to drive structurally higher profitability over time. Let's turn to our segment results. Server revenues were $3.9 billion in the quarter. This was up 16% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year. Strengths in both AI systems and traditional servers drove the healthy revenue growth. Our cumulative AI system product and service orders since Q1 2023, rose approximately $600 million sequentially to $4.6 billion. I am very pleased with our AI system product revenue more than doubled sequentially to over $900 million. This strong revenue growth allowed us to make progress against our backlog, which is now $3.1 billion. Given the growing importance of our services business, we have updated our AI disclosures for this quarter to include services. Services is a small portion of our AI systems metrics at present, though we expect it to become more meaningful over time. Our differentiation with liquid cooling, software, HPE GreenLake and increasingly, services is resonating in the market. We have seen a threefold increase in our enterprise AI customer base in the past year. Revenue from our traditional server business increased sequentially. We expect this trend to continue. Demand is improving, as enterprises digest prior purchases and gain more comfort with the macro outlook. Structural mix shift to higher AUP Gen11 servers is ahead of our expectations, and we are able to pass-through rising input costs. We are encouraged that our Gen11 pipeline is starting to include AI inferencing activity and enterprise applications, and we see more evidence of adoption in the enterprise in Q2. Our Q2 operating margin was 11%. This was down 40 basis points sequentially and was in-line with the expectations we laid out last quarter for our operating margins [near] (ph) the lower-end of our long-term 11% to 13% range. While pricing remains aggressive in the server market, particularly in AI systems, we remain disciplined in cost and price, as we pursue profitable growth. Hybrid cloud revenues of $1.3 billion were up 1% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year. We are already seeing some cross-selling benefits of integrating the majority of our HPE GreenLake offering into a single business unit. I mentioned a 39% growth in ARR this quarter. Our traditional storage business was down year-over-year. The business is managing two long-term transitions at once. We talked about our migration to the more software-intensive Alletra platform. This is reducing current period revenue growth, so locking in future recurring revenue. Storage ARR growth of over 50% year-over-year offers early confidence into the migration. The second transition is from block storage to file storage driven by AI. While early, this is also on the right trajectory. Our new file offerings plus the sales force investment Antonio mentioned tripled our pipeline of file storage deals sequentially in Q2. Our operating margin was 0.8%, which was down 300 basis points sequentially and 110 basis points year-over-year. Reduced revenue scale and an unfavorable mix of third-party products and traditional storage was the largest driver of the sequential change. Intelligent Edge revenues were $1.1 billion. Revenues fell 9% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. Backlog consumption created difficult compares with both prior periods. Our backlog is now at normal levels. The demand environment remains soft and large enterprises have yet to return to the market in force. However, we do see some green shoots that give us confidence in networking will transition to modest sequential growth beyond Q2, as we had expected. Our channel inventory remains within the normal range. Wi-Fi has grown sequentially for two consecutive quarters. Growth remains strong in software and services. Attach rates and renewals for Aruba Central, SASE and our AIOps software remains strong. The Intelligent Edge portfolio of subscription revenue grew above 50% year-over-year. The segment operating margin of 21.8% was down 760 basis points sequentially and 290 basis points year-over-year. As expected, the lower revenues, reduced mix of switching business and the less revenue from backlog were the primary drivers. As we indicated last quarter, we have reset our OpEx plan for the year to account for lower revenue and expect the Intelligent Edge, operating margin to be back in the mid-20% range by Q4. Our HPE Financial Services revenue was up 1% year-over-year, and financing volume was $1.7 billion. Our operating margin of 9.3% was up 80 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year. Our Q2 loss ratio remained steady below 0.5%. These results are what we have come to expect from this high-quality, predictable business. However, underneath these steady results, FS is already adapting to drive AI growth across the business. Year-to-date, nearly $0.5 billion of our $3 billion in financing volume went to AI wins with both cloud and enterprise customers. This illustrates our prior point that AI is driving demand to every one of our businesses. Turning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations and $610 million in free cash flow this quarter. HPE typically consumes significant amount of cash in the first half of the year and then generates cash in the second half. We are ahead of traditional free cash flow patterns thus far in fiscal 2024, given higher than expected net income in Q2, prepayments for AI systems, and timing of working capital payments. Our cash conversion cycle was negative four days, which is a reduction of 28 days from Q2 '23. Our days of inventory and days payable were both higher to support our expected growth in AI system revenue in the second half. We returned $240 million in capital to shareholders in Q2, including $169 million in dividends and $45 million in share repurchases. Our year-to-date capital return is $386 million. Let's turn now to our forward view. We expect a materially stronger second half led by AI systems, traditional servers, and storage, networking and HPE GreenLake. Let me recap the key drivers that factor into our expectations for Q3 and the full year. For server, we expect improving GPU supply for AI systems and improving demand for traditional servers to drive sequential revenue increases through fiscal year 2024. While the rising AI systems mix is a gross margin headwind, we are balancing this with higher-margin services revenue, improving scale and cost discipline. We expect the segment operating margin to be approximately 11% for the fiscal year. For hybrid cloud, we expect slight sequential revenue increases throughout the year. HPE GreenLake growth should continue and traditional storage should improve slightly. We expect operating margin to improve modestly to the mid-single-digit range through the year as HPE GreenLake deals mature, new products ramp, and our sales force optimization gathers momentum. For Intelligent Edge, we anticipate a slight sequential growth in Q3 and Q4, driven primarily by seasonal education spending rather than improving markets. We continue to expect our cost reduction efforts to materialize in the second half and our full year operating margin to be in the mid-20% range. With that context, let me now turn to our outlook. For Q3, we expect revenues in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.29 and $0.34, and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.43 and $0.48. For fiscal year 2024, we now expect constant currency revenue growth of 1% to 3%, which is up from our prior 0% to 2% range. We reiterate our non-GAAP operating profit growth guidance of 0% to 2%. We are reducing our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance by $0.20 to $1.61 to $1.71 to incorporate the recent updates to our H3C proceeds. We are raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance up $0.03 to $1.85 to $1.95. This incremental $0.03 or $0.06 annualized reflects the contribution from the retained portion of our H3C stake. We are also increasingly comfortable with the high-end of the non-GAAP diluted net EPS range, given our OI&E and operational improvement. We are excluding from our non-GAAP results the gain on sale from our H3C and CTG divestments. This year's mix shift from networking to AI systems should weigh on our gross margins. We expect the fiscal '24 non-GAAP gross margin to be below our full year expectation of 35% from our Analyst Day. To balance the mix shift, we are driving further simplicity and efficiency across the business. We are accelerating our generative AI capabilities such as implementing HPE-specific large language models and chatbots for our sales and service representatives. As I mentioned last quarter, prudent cost management, simplified processes, and disciplined execution across cycles are key tenets of our long-term journey towards higher margins. These cost actions will be evident in financial results in the second half of fiscal '24. We now expect fiscal year '24 OpEx to be down modestly from fiscal '23 OpEx. Our prior view was flat to down. This includes a sequential increase in Q3 for marketing before a sequentially lower Q4, which will serve us well heading into fiscal '25. We expect our fiscal '24 operating margin to be flattish year-over-year. We now expect OI&E to be less of a headwind this year. We anticipate $150 million headwind versus our prior expectation of a $200 million to $250 million headwind, given a one-time benefit in Q2 and the retained portion of our H3C stake. We expect the effect of currency to be immaterial. Our strong first half free cash flow increases our confidence that we will deliver at least $1.9 billion in fiscal year '24. We expect significantly stronger free cash flow in the second half of the year led by higher earnings, given our ramp in AI systems. This does not include the $2.1 billion that we expect to receive from Unisplendour this fiscal year, as a result of our recently restructured agreement to sell our stake in H3C. We expect working capital to be neutral to free cash flow as we expect declines in inventory to balance declines in accounts payable. We remain committed in the long-term to our balanced capital allocation framework, including our target of returning 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders. In the near term, we expect to continue share repurchases at a pace in line with Q2 as we prudently manage our balance sheet, ahead of the anticipated receipt of the H3C proceeds and the Juniper transaction closing. The proposed Juniper deal remains on track to close in late 2024 or early '25 as planned. We remain committed to our dividend and to our investment grade rating. To conclude, our solid Q2 results illustrate how comprehensively AI is affecting our portfolio. We are capturing profitable growth opportunities in the AI market. We are excited to discover and look forward to seeing many of you at our IR Summit. I'll open it up now for your questions. Hi Amit, good afternoon. it's Marie, and happy to take the question. And look, obviously, we shipped $900 million of AI revenue in the quarter. And I think as you saw, our margin rate on our service segment from an operating profit perspective was 11%. So look, honestly as the CFO, very pleased that's what we guided and that's what we achieved, and that's what we've guided for the second half of the year. In terms of what's the puts and takes and the headwinds and tailwinds, let me give you some color around it. So from a headwind perspective, obviously we're dealing with a tougher inflationary commodity market, particularly even in the second half. And we also see, as you saw in the quarter, a greater mix of AI servers actually in our overall server mix. And as you know and you've heard, it's a pretty competitive market out there I might add, too. But clearly, we're managing it very well. And I'd say what's benefiting us is a couple of really important tailwinds. One is what we are seeing in terms of the Gen11 transition. That part of the business brings a higher AUP. And then also frankly, Amit it's the work we're doing around cost. So as a result, I think this really illustrates that we are very disciplined around both price and cost and frankly, it's part of our strategy to drive profitable growth. So pleased with the results, and that's how we are guiding the back half of the year, Amit. Yes. Good afternoon. And in terms of where we're at Intelligent Edge, I think as I commented in my prepared remarks, we saw Q2 as being the trough period, and we've been transitioning through that throughout the quarter. And if you look at the market and where it's at right now, I'd say, that our channel inventory right now is in really good shape. And we did mention in the guide that we do expect a modest sequential improvement in networking in the back-half of the year. Yes. Hi Toni, good afternoon. So this is Marie. I'm going to take the first question just on the guide. So let me just clarify the guidance in terms of how we put it together. So we raised the guide from -- to $1.85 to $1.95, and that actually was the pass-through on that 19% stake in H3C. So we actually put $0.03 related to the 19% stake. What I did point to though, Toni, is I pointed to the higher end of the range, so that's really what's giving us confidence based on the increase that we made on revenue. So you're seeing that higher top-line and then also the confidence I got around just the cost discipline. So you've seen that just in the last couple of quarters where we've had a really strong scrutiny and focus around OpEx. And plus we did have some favorability in OI&E this quarter, that [beats] (ph) \u2013 that was actually just a onetime. So I just want to make that point of clarification. So overall, Toni, keeping the guide at $1.85 to $1.95 but really pointing to the higher end of the guide in terms of just the confidence that you articulated. So I'll turn it over to Antonio to cover the second question. Hi Ruplu, we look forward to seeing you tomorrow. So in terms of your question around just ARR and AI, actually, it was the fastest growth element of ARR in Q2, followed by storage and networking. So I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are starting to see AI to sort of move through our entire portfolio. So pleased with the progress that we had this quarter, and I'll turn it over to Antonio to add some more context."

            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Good afternoon, And thank you for joining us today. HPE delivered a very solid performance in the second quarter, with revenue and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exceeding our outlook range, driven by AI systems revenue more than doubling from our first quarter. I am very optimistic about where we're headed. AI demand continues to accelerate with cumulative AI systems orders reaching $4.6 billion this quarter. We have a robust pipeline in this business, though large AI orders can cause fluctuations during the quarter. We anticipate continued revenue growth driven by increased AI systems demand, continued adoption of HPE GreenLake, and ongoing improvement in the traditional infrastructure market, including servers, storage, and networking. Due to our confidence in the second half of fiscal year 2024, we are raising our full-year revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance and reiterating free cash flow guidance. Marie will provide more specifics in her remarks. While we focus on translating strong AI customer demand to revenue growth. We continue to drive cost discipline to operate more efficiently and to preserve the ability to make targeted investments, which will sustain our growth into the future. We are being prudent with our spending and reduce operating expenses in the first half, as compared to the prior year period. We're also driving business process simplification across the company, including through digitization and automation with AI. Demand for HPE's AI systems is accelerating at a faster pace, and our solid execution enabled us to more than double our AI systems' revenue sequentially to over $900 million, helped by supply chain conversion through improved GPU availability. Our lead time to deliver NVIDIA H100 solutions is now between six and 12 weeks, depending on order size and complexity. We expect this will provide a lift to our revenues in the second half of the year. Enterprise customer interest in AI is rapidly growing, and our sellers are seeing a higher level of engagement. Enterprise orders now comprise more than 15% of our cumulative AI systems orders, with the number of Enterprise AI customers nearly tripling year-over-year. As these engagements continue to progress from exploration and discovery phase, we anticipate additional acceleration in enterprise AI systems orders through the end of the fiscal year. So Amit, on the differentiation, I will summarize this on four key elements. One is our ability to deliver and run systems at scale, so AI system scale, that's a unique expertise and we have decades of experience. Number two is our infrastructure cooling intellectual property. We actually have all the IP necessary to cool systems in three different ways for them other. Our manufacturing footprint, which is very unique. We have one of the largest water-cooled manufacturing footprints in the world with two very important locations in the US and in Europe, which are close to customers. And then last but not least is services. What I think people are coming to realize that running the system of scale requires unique services capabilities. And that's why with Marie, we started showing you what the services pull-through is, which is also over time, a lever to improve the gross margin in this business. And we cover all aspects from day zero which consulting, to day one, which is advisory and professional services design and then -- and build, and then day 2, which is a running part with our -- in our operational services side and deep expertise when it comes down to this system of scale, including direct liquid cooling. All those four key elements are a big differentiation for us. Yes. Thanks, Aaron. I think it's fair to say that the enterprise demand has started to pick in Q1 and really accelerate in Q2. Early on, if you go back to the Q1 2023 all the way to, call it, calendar 2023, a lot of demand came from the model builders, the service providers, and hyperscalers and you see the reference to our partner, Microsoft. But as I think about that, I think three segments of the market. I think about [dark segment] (ph), which is driving a lot of demand for a lot of GPUs and accelerated compute in general. The second segment is sovereign clouds and that starts to pick up now. And that's, think about tens of customers around the globe because obviously, our countries. And then there is enterprise customers, which will be thousands of customers over time. So today, we are very pleased with the momentum in enterprise AI. A lot of the conversations are happening. I was in Europe the last two weeks and I was in London, I was in Paris, I was in Madrid. All of them want to adopt AI. And I think they are attracted to HPE because of the trust, the quality, and the ability to deliver a simplified experience to our HPE GreenLake platform. As for the differentiation, HPE has three different ways to cool systems. So one is the traditional way, which is called the liquid-to-air cooler, think about that, basically running water supply in chilled locations where basically cools the air around the systems. Everybody has done that for a long time. The second is what most of the industry is doing today, which is what I call 70% direct liquid cooling or hybrid liquid cooling. Those companies still use fans to cool aspects of the systems. Some of our competitors talk about direct liquid cooling, but that's exactly what they're doing, and they are doing only a hybrid direct liquid cooling. And HPE has -- and by the way, in that environment, we have 10 systems already in market today that we are shipping and configuring for customers. And then we have what I call 100% direct liquid cooling. And this is a unique differentiation HPE has because we have been doing 100% direct liquid cooling for a long time. And today, there are six systems in deployment, and three of them are for generative AI. And as we go to the next generation of the silicon and you talk about Blackwell, when you go to the B200, that will require 100% direct liquid cooling. And that's a unique opportunity for us because you need not only the IP and the capabilities to cool the infrastructure but also the manufacturing side. And that's why I said early on to the previous call, that HPE has one of the largest water-cooled manufacturing capabilities. So that is what really differentiate us. And even on the hybrid way to cool the system, HPE is not using off-the-shelf solution. We use what we call an ARC, which stands for adaptive rack cooling system, is a unique design. And the good news is that we can actually colocate in the same data center and in the same aisle, direct liquid cooling and air-cooled systems, which is unique because customers don't want to retrofit data center. So that's the opportunity. Yes. And I will say in addition to what Marie said, what I'm really excited is that we see interesting areas of growth happening now. If you go back to Mobile World Congress and you see even announcements like we made yesterday, the enterprise private 5G is picking up significant momentum. Of my almost 40 meetings I had in Barcelona, more than half were about enterprise private 5G. And so yesterday, we announced the most complete enterprise private 5G on the back of the Athonet acquisition. Yes. Toni, I think there is an opportunity to potentially exceed that. I think the limiting factor is not the supply, to be honest with you, is the availability of data center space. I made this comment in Q1, if you recall, data center space and power and cooling. And so some -- we are working with the customers to time everything correctly, six to 12 weeks, think about it, maybe less than a quarter, but then you have to go and install it. And there is a nice percentage of our deals in generative AI, which are all actually GreenLake. And so while we can recognize the revenue upfront, we are deferring all the services piece of it. So it really is going to come down to the timing of the data center and the power and cooling. And if that all aligns correctly, then we may have an opportunity to do better. But we felt prudent at this point in time to keep it the way it is and raising by 1%. Sure. Thank you. Yes, our backlog was slightly down quarter-over-quarter, also was based on the demand we took in and also the fact that we converted more. I think you have to realize some of these deals, particularly larger deals take time and a little bit lump. Some of them have to go through the financing side. And so we feel good about where we are today. But in terms of the pipeline, think about multiples of the current backlog, multiples of the current backlog. So as we go through the next weeks and quarters here, we feel very confident in our ability to capture that AI for all the reasons I described before, and also the ability to close these deals as some of them may include, by the way, the need to provide data center space as well because we are not just building the system. And these are all generative AI systems, by the way, all of them that we also need to run it for customers. No, I don't think it has to do anything with location. I read all this thing about location. We have a fantastic partnership with NVIDIA is about lead times in the general H100, which obviously NVIDIA made significant improvements on their own. And then obviously, as we start ramping our manufacturing processes, we actually become better and better at the revenue conversion. And I would say, I want to thank my team because my team did a fantastic job and we feel good about as we go forward. So it's a combination of multiple things, better lead times on supply. We feel pretty good about the ability to deliver systems 6 to 12 weeks to Toni's question, and some of them are straightforward is just shipments and some are with our HPE GreenLake offering wrapped around. Yes. On the second part of the question, I think we are early at this point in time. I think there is more to be seen. And I want to make sure I captured exactly what you said. Can you repeat the last part because you were a little bit breaking. Yes. So on sovereign AI, I said it's early, early on. I think there is a lot of engagements right now happening at the country level. The good news, we have very good reach across the board. And it's a combination of both. There is a combination of providing what I call generative AI locations where customers, enterprise customers can get access to -- to a sovereign cloud that the government may be helping funding at the same time. And the other one is what I call supercomputing power, right, itself. And so the two are very well aligned to the sovereign AI opportunities. And that's why I'm excited because HPE already provides to a lot of the sovereign governments supercomputing. So now we can extend into generative AI. If you think about the example of the UK Bristol is a generative AI system that the UK is funding as a part of the Bristol University, that the venture is going to be open to start-ups and enterprises in the UK, to either train models or do other type of research. And that's what we see. Yes. No, thank you. I said that the segment where we have seen, obviously the vast majority of action and demand is the model builders. Those are the big companies that build large and small language models. Obviously, you saw our comments about our partner with Microsoft and the extension of their capacity to OpenAI. That's an example of a model builder. But also there are other service providers. And in fact, in my remarks, I mentioned Scaleway, which is a French service provider that provides the capacity for the local French model builders. In fact, there is a lot -- there is a very vibrant ecosystem in France about building AI models that will use that capacity to train the models. That's what I referred to at this point in time. And that's what we see and that's what we've seen. So we are very interested in not just the model builders but Tier 2, Tier 3, which also is going to be a big driver. But understanding that enterprise, ultimately what the action is going to happen in terms of fine-tuning and deploying these AI models over time. Yes. I mean, listen, I'm very pragmatic about these things. Today, in generative AI, the market leader is NVIDIA. And that's where we have aligned our strategy, that's where we have aligned our offerings. And as I made my remarks earlier, we have 10 systems already in the mixed cooling environment and six systems or six offers also in the direct liquid cooling environment. So we are aligning with NVIDIA today, and that's why you are going to see at Discover, Jensen coming on stage with me to talk about what we're doing together. Now when you go into the sovereign space where there may be some components of supercomputing down the road, obviously, they designed their own systems with our help, and that will be a mixed environment. But just in the last month or so, we opened a new system in the Los Alamos laboratory, which was actually an NVIDIA system with HPE and is direct liquid cooled, so we are clear about that. But then there are also systems that will come in 2025 that may have different type of accelerators. Over time, we are going to be time to market. But right now, we have aligned to NVIDIA and that's what we're doing. And that's why I think it will be a great opportunity for you to join us at HPE Discover because you can see everything we talked today on the floor. Every system I just referred to my slides, every comment I made in my answers to the questions, you can come and see it. These are systems and IP that we are shipping today and you're going to see our time to market with this silicon in addition to all the services in HPE GreenLake. So it's going to be an amazing opportunity also because we are doing the keynote at Sphere, we're going to have probably inside, The Sphere more than 17,000 customers and partners joining us. So I know we don't have a lot of -- the normal time for questions, but I will say thank you for joining today. As a recap, the quarter was very solid. Our AI system revenue more than doubled to $900 million, allowing us to obviously exceed our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. Because the demand in AI is strong, we have a multiple of -- in the backlog, in our pipeline and some aspects of the traditional infrastructure market is recovering, plus our disciplined execution on pricing and cost, we are raising both the revenue and EPS guidance. And on the revenue, there could be something more obviously, but it's depending on some of the timing. And then obviously on the EPS, we are comfortable with the higher end of the range, as Marie said. So again, we are very pleased. We feel the second half is going to set up really well. And then obviously, we are looking forward to see many of you at HPE Discover in just less than two weeks. Thank you for your time today."

With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\nAntonio Neri : Thank you, Shannon. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we are proud to have outpaced our profitability expectations while advancing our long-term strategy. We also continue to scale our recurring revenue, achieving the second highest year-over-year growth rate since we started tracking ARR in late 2019. This is a promising indicator for our ongoing portfolio shift to higher-margin revenues. But overall, Q1 revenue performance did not meet our expectations. During this call, I will address three key points. First, I will touch on our revenue, which was lower than expected in large part because network and demand softened industry-wide and because the timing of several large GPU acceptances shifted. Additionally, we did not have the GPU supply we wanted, curtailing our revenue upside.  Second, I will address how we are streamlining our reporting segments, accelerating a new specialized sales model, managing our spending and reinforcing execution discipline. Third and most importantly, I will discuss the progress we're making in executing our long-term strategy, which we remain confident in. Let me first address revenue in the quarter. Similar to peers in the market, we saw campus networking product demand weakened and the decline later in the quarter was greater than expected. This was a large headwind relative to our expectations. Customers are taking longer to digest prior orders than we had anticipated, which partially offset the benefit of our backlog entering the quarter. And Europe and Asia were areas of relative softness. We expect weakness in the networking market to persist, which is likely to impact revenue through fiscal year 2024. That said, we anticipate some improvement late in fiscal year 2024 as inventory clears and we ramp into the purchasing season for state and local education customers in the United States. AI server demand remains very strong, evidenced by our growing cumulative order book. However, GPU availability remains tight, and our delivery timing has also been affected by the increasing length of time customers require to set up the data center space, power and cooling requirements needed to run these systems.  As a result, overall AI server orders conversion was below our expectations. However, the AI contribution to ARR is increasing. We continue to prioritize profitability. I am pleased that we have delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 36.2%, which is up 200 basis points year-over-year and above 600 basis points from fiscal year 2018. This performance helped our Q1 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share grow to $0.48, which was above the midpoint of our guidance range despite lower-than-expected revenue, illustrating the positive impact of our pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue.  We know that the current environment will require continued discipline in how we execute. We are accelerating new specialized sales motions to maximize opportunities and improve order linearity across our portfolio. Improved cost management will remain an important competency for us in fiscal year 2024.  We also found opportunity to streamline our reporting segments. We have now combined the Compute and HPC and AI segments into a single server segment that integrates general-purpose computing, high-performance computing, supercomputing, and AI systems. This will enable us to maximize the opportunities across the entire AI life cycle, from training to tuning to inferencing and execute with agility.  And as previously discussed, we have simplified our hybrid cloud strategy by putting all related products, software and services into one business unit. Our new hybrid cloud segment will further accelerate customer adoption of the HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform. Turning to our strategy. While we are experiencing cyclicality in submarkets, I am more confident than ever in our long-term strategy that is aligned to key market mega trends. In edge, over the last several quarters, we have gained share in the campus networking markets and our strategic investments have played off. Most recently, we have seen strong growth in SASE, an offering bolstered by our acquisition of Silver Peak in 2020 and Axis Security in 2023. Our sales pipeline for our private 5G offering is also growing rapidly, following our acquisition of Athonet in 2023. In hybrid cloud, HPE GreenLake continues to resonate in the marketplace and was the private driver of the highest Q1 year-over-year rise in ARR over the 4-plus years we have been reporting it. Our ARR grew 41% year-over-year to more than $1.4 billion in Q1, and we continue to expect ARR growth of 35% to 45% as we look ahead. We're also capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities when customers come to us for our AI solutions and realize we can meet their storage needs as well. In AI, we are capturing the explosion in demand for AI systems. Our cumulative accelerator processing unit orders rose to $4 billion in the quarter, driven by demand across HPE Cray EX and XT solutions, as well as HPE ProLiant Gen11 AI-optimized servers. AP orders represent nearly 25% of our total server orders since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our pipeline is large and growing across the entire AI life cycle from training to tuning to inferencing. We are starting to see AI demand pull-through for other solutions, including storage. We expect our server and hybrid cloud segments to grow sequentially through the fiscal year. Server revenue stands to benefit from AI system demand, improving GPU supply, and our continued mix shift to HPE ProLiant Gen11. Hybrid cloud will benefit from continued HPE GreenLake storage demand and the rising productivity of our specialized sales force.  Our customers continue to validate our value proposition. As one example, we are building for A&E, one of the world's largest energy providers, a new HPE Cray EX supercomputer that will reach more than half an exaflop performance. The system will be one of the most powerful in the world for enterprise use and will accelerate AI-driven scientific discovery to advance efforts in energy. We also have been awarded the deal for Poland's most powerful supercomputer system located at the Academic Computer Center Cipher Net of the AGH University of Science and Technology. Based on the HPE Cray EX supercomputer and HPE Slingshot Interconnect Fabric with NVIDIA Grace Hopper GPUs, the system will be used to support modeling simulation and AI-driven scientific research needs, including training and tuning of large language models. We're also seeing growth in AI inferencing. For example, Coles Supermarkets, a leading Australian retailer, implemented an HPE ProLiant Gen11 AI inferencing solution in Q1, which helps with video imaging to reduce store stock lost to theft and scanning at the checkout. In the quarter, we expanded our strategic collaboration with NVIDIA targeting the enterprise segment of the market. We introduced a preconfigured solution for enterprise customers to fine-tune AI large language models with their private data to accelerate inferencing. Our HPE machine learning development environment software and unique HPE supercomputer and IP are critical parts of the solution, alongside NVIDIA AI enterprise software. We have built a strong and growing sales pipeline for this new offering. We also continue to build out our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform services. Earlier this quarter, we announced an expanded HPE GreenLake for file storage that is designed for generative AI. This solution is highly differentiated through a high-performant file system solution specifically designed for AI applications. We believe it better positions us to take market share in storage by addressing the previously underserved segment of the file market.  Innovation like this continue to attract customers to HPE GreenLake platform, which connects 3.8 million network devices and supports more than 31,000 customer organizations, up approximately 8% from last quarter. One new HPE GreenLake customer is the U.S. Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, which produces critical models of weather and ocean conditions for the U.S. and coalition forces worldwide. They turned to HPE GreenLake to improve predictability, accuracy and speed of their modeling while reducing costs.  This week, I attended the Mobile World Congress where AI and private 5G were the key topics among telcos and service providers alike. With our pending acquisition of Juniper Networks, HPE's portfolio will expand to better serve these unique customers from the edge of the network to core 5G to cloud. Customers were very interested in our integration of Athonet private 5G capabilities into our Intelligent Edge portfolio as well as in our cloud OpenRAN and VRAN solutions. They were also very eager to explore the massive new market opportunity AI inferencing presents at the edge of the network.  That is one of the reasons why we're so excited about our pending Juniper Networks acquisition. Combining our complementary portfolios will supercharge HPE's edge-to-cloud strategy, accelerating our entire portfolio with AI-enabled innovation. When our proposed acquisition closes, we will create a new networking innovator, with our comprehensive portfolio for and partners. The transaction is expected to double the size of our networking business, which will be the core foundation of covering the anticipated $180 billion market opportunity with our combined IP.  From a financial perspective, this transaction is also compelling for our shareholders. In the first year post close, we expect accretion to non-GAAP earnings per share and, in the long term, higher non-GAAP gross and operating margins. We are working to secure regulatory approvals in several jurisdictions. We are hopeful that regulators will recognize that this acquisition is centered around driving further innovation for our customers. We continue to expect that the transaction will close later this calendar year or in early calendar 2025. In summary, Q1 2024 was a mixed quarter for HPE. We achieved strong profitability and drove new record ARR growth with overall revenue short-term expectations, given the softening networking market, GPU deal timing and, to some extent, GPU availability. We are focused on execution as we navigate the fluctuations demand we see in certain areas of the market.  Marie will take you through our adjusted guidance, which reflects our latest thinking about the year ahead. This quarter is a moment in time and does not at all dampen our confidence in the future ahead of us. We have taken the right actions to maximize value for our shareholders. The work we are doing now, combined with our technological edge and our strategy that has never been more relevant, will position us to convert on the long-term opportunities in front of us across edge, hybrid cloud, and AI. Before we transition, I'm delighted to welcome Marie Myers as our new CFO. Having worked with her at HP before the separation, it is a pleasure to partner with her again. I am passion for and skill ad, fueling innovation and performance. I am confident that Marie is a great fit for this role and expect she will help drive the next phase of growth and shareholder return for HPE.  I will now turn the call over to her for details about our segments and our outlook. Marie?\nMarie Myers : Thank you, Antonio. I'm pleased to be with you today on my first earnings call as HPE's CFO. I've long admired HPE's impressive transformation, and there has never been a more exciting time to be part of this company. We have a growing addressable market, a proven strategy and a differentiated portfolio that is levered to long-term market trends around networking, hybrid cloud and AI. I believe we have a significant opportunity ahead of us. I'm excited to partner with Antonio and the rest of the outstanding HPE team to capitalize on this opportunity and drive value for our shareholders. And as Antonio mentioned, we have much to be proud of. Financial highlights in the quarter included record gross margins and expense discipline, which helped lift non-GAAP EPS to the high end of our guidance range. Demand for our traditional server and storage products has stabilized. Demand for our HPE GreenLake offerings was evident in a healthy ARR growth and demand for our AI systems remains robust.  However, demand in Intelligent Edge did soften due to customer digestion of strong product shipments in fiscal year '23, which is lasting longer than we initially anticipated and is the primary reason Q1 revenue came in below our expectations. GPU availability and deal timing also contributed. We are taking swift action to address these headwinds by curtailing costs and driving efficiencies across the business. With that, let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Revenue fell 14% year-over-year in constant currency to $6.8 billion. Please recall, we had significant backlog consumption in Q1 '23, particularly in traditional servers and storage. Backlog has now largely normalized across our business with the exception of our APU products.  We have strong momentum in HPE GreenLake. ARR exceeded $1.4 billion in Q1. Storage and networking software and services are the fastest growth elements of ARR. Our software and services mix rose 400 basis points year-over-year to 69%. ARR is the best indicator of our model transformation to our as-a-service offerings. This growth validates what our customers are telling us, that HPE GreenLake is a differentiated value proposition in the market. Our Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 36.2%. It rose 200 basis points year-over-year, driven by a mix shift to Intelligent Edge and favorable input cost management. We are pleased that our non-GAAP gross margin is up 600 basis points from fiscal year '18 to a company record. This illustrates the ongoing pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue across our portfolio.  Given the current networking market dynamics, we are taking this moment to streamline and simplify our operations. We are focused on controlling the things we can control. Prudent cost management and disciplined execution are important regardless of the macro environment and are even more critical at times like these. The benefits of our focus are already evident in our Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses, which declined 4.7% year-over-year at 9.5% sequentially to $1.7 billion. The strong Q1 non-GAAP gross margins and OpEx discipline led to Q1 non-GAAP operating margins of 11.5%, which is down only 30 basis points year-over-year despite less revenue scale.  Favorable timing on some corporate expenses was a tailwind to Q1 operating expense and will appear in Q2. GAAP EPS of $0.29 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.48 exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. Our diluted share count was approximately 1.3 billion, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exclude $251 million in costs primarily from stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and noncash loss on investments. As we manage the business with focus and discipline, we will also invest to capitalize on the sizable opportunities associated with moving through the interrelated inflection points in networking, hybrid cloud, and AI all at the same time. HPE is evolving into a more simple, more agile company that is even better positioned to pursue our growth opportunities and to evolve our mix of products, services and software and to drive structural higher profitability. Turning to our segment results. In addition to the new segments we discussed at SAM, we also created a new service segment that combines our prior compute and HPC and AI segment under one streamlined segment that offers solutions for our customers' training, tuning, and inferencing AI needs across the AI life cycle. Server revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter, which was down 23% year-over-year. This new segment had a difficult year-over-year compare as in Q1 '23, the business made significant progress against its backlog and benefit from HPE Cray EX revenue for Frontier. We are capturing the robust growth in AI demand. Our cumulative APU orders since Q1 '23, which include APU attached products and services in our HPE Cray EX XD and ProLiant Systems, rose approximately sequentially to now $4 billion. Our pipeline is robust and GPU supply, while still constrained, is improving.  Our APU product revenue increased sequentially to well over $400 million. We are now converting our APU orders into revenues, and yet very strong demand means our APU backlog is over $3 billion. Our pipeline is well above that. AI revenue in the quarter included our first revenues from AI cloud offering and from our HPE GreenLake win with a large hyperscale customer. Our traditional high-performance computing and supercomputing revenue fell seasonally, sequentially following a strong Q4.  Revenue from our traditional server business increased sequentially. We expect this trend to continue, given a structural mix shift to higher AUP Gen11 and rising input costs. General servers nearly doubled sequentially to 30% of the mix in Q1. Including HPE, Cray XD takes the mix of next-generation servers to 44%. We are encouraged that our Gen11 pipeline is starting to include AI inferencing activity and enterprise applications.  We expect AI inferencing to gather momentum in fiscal year '24. As a reminder, our Gen11 services come with an attached subscription to our compute ops management software, which lifts our margin structure.  Our Q1 operating margin was 11.4%. While up sequentially, the margin was down 430 basis points year-over-year, given declining revenues. Intelligent Edge revenues were $1.2 billion or up 2% year-over-year. Demand for our campus switching and Wi-Fi products eased materially, particularly in Europe and Asia, and was the largest contributor to our Q1 revenue gap. We continue to see mid-single-digit growth benefits from our existing backlog but expect it to normalize going forward as we are now approaching our typical range. Our total channel inventory is within the normal range overall, inclusive of a pocket in the SMB business. We also continue to make progress in our new TAMs of data center networking, private 5G and SASE. The Intelligent Edge portfolio of subscription revenue grew well above 50% as we are benefiting from growing attach from our strong fiscal year '23 revenue growth.  We are pleased with our 29.4% operating margin, which was up 1,000 basis points year-over-year. The new hybrid cloud segment includes our storage businesses and now the HPE GreenLake portion of our server business. Revenues of $1.2 billion were down 10% year-over-year. Our traditional storage business was down year-over-year on difficult compares, given backlog consumption in Q1 '23. Total Electro subscription revenue grew over 100% year-over-year and is an illustration of our long-term transition to an as-a-service model across our businesses. We are starting to see AI server demand pull through interest in our file storage portfolio. We are also already seeing some cross-selling benefits of integrating the majority of our HPE GreenLake offering into a single business unit. Our operating margin was 3.8%, which was down 200 basis points year-over-year. Lower revenues and a high mix of third-party product impacted margins in the traditional storage business. Our HPE Financial Services revenue was down 2% year-over-year and financing volume was $1.4 billion. Our operating margin of 8.5% was up 130 basis points year-over-year. We are successfully passing through interest rate increases, and our asset management margins are returning to normal. Our Q1 loss ratio remained steady at 0.5%. Turning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $64 million in cash flow from operations and consumed $482 million in free cash flow this quarter. HPE typically consumes cash in the first half of the year and generates cash in the second half. Our first quarter free cash flow benefited from some prepayments associated with pending HPE GreenLake deals at HPE Cray XD shipments.  Our cash conversion cycle was seven days, which is a reduction of eight days from Q1 '23. Our days payable and days of inventory were both higher, given the lower revenue and strong demand for APUs. We returned $172 million in capital to shareholders in Q1, primarily through our dividend. Before I discuss our outlook, let me first recap the key drivers that factor into our expectations for Q2 and the full year. For server, we expect improving GPU supply to drive sequential revenue increases through fiscal year '24. Given improving supply and the timing of installations, we expect segment revenue and therefore, corporate revenue to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. We expect the blended margin of the new segment to be flattish for the remainder of the fiscal year. For Intelligent Edge, we expect the market to remain soft throughout the year. Our cost reduction efforts will take time to show their benefits, which will result in margin pressure in Q2. Later in our fiscal year, we expect our normal channel inventory position and seasonal strength in the education market to be a modest revenue tailwind. We expect the full year margin to be in the mid-20% range.  For hybrid cloud, we expect sequential increases through the year as our traditional storage business improves and HPE GreenLake momentum continues. We expect meaningful progress through the year. With that context, let me turn to our outlook. For Q2, we expect revenues in the range of $6.6 billion to $7 billion or up slightly sequentially at the midpoint. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.20 and $0.25 and our non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.36 and $0.41. In part, given the higher prepayments in Q1, we expect negative free cash flow in Q2.  Let me remind you that we have two drivers of potential lumpiness in our business. One is the timing and customer acceptances of large Cray wins, including Cray XD wins, which should ramp beginning in Q2. The second is the start of certain large HPE GreenLake deals. For some of these large deals, our segments recognize the related hardware on installation. In our consolidated results, we eliminate the segment revenue and recognize it over time. Both large deals and higher eliminations are indicators of our confidence in the second half of the fiscal year.  For fiscal year '24, we are revising our outlook, primarily given the current networking market headwinds. Let me remind you that we are excluding the H3C earnings and gain on sale from our non-GAAP results beginning in fiscal year '24. We now expect revised ranges for constant currency revenue and non-GAAP operating profit growth of zero to 2%. GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.81 to $1.91 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.82 to $1.92. The mix shift from Intelligent Edge to server should also weigh on our gross margins.  We now expect the full year non-GAAP gross margin to be slightly down from our prior full year expectation of 35%. We expect the impact of the cost actions we have initiated to materialize in the second half and leave fiscal year '24 OpEx to be flat to down from fiscal '23 OpEx. We expect our operating margin to be flattish year-over-year. We now expect OI&E to be $200 million to $250 million headwind versus our prior $300 million expectation, given better Q1 free cash flow and more favorable interest rate assumptions. We expect the effect on currency to be immaterial. We expect free cash flow to be at least $1.9 billion in fiscal year '24. We expect significantly stronger free cash flow in the second half of the year led by improvements in inventories as AI service shipments ramp. We reiterate our commitment to our dividend, which was raised 8% from fiscal year '23 to fiscal year '24. Debt repayment to maintain an investment-grade credit rating, and in long term, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, we executed well in Q1 amidst a challenging market backdrop. We are pleased with our margin and EPS results while understanding our slower networking product demand and GPU availability and timing impacted our revenue performance. We have taken prompt action to further reduce our costs and continue to manage our expenses prudently while we advance our long-term strategy.  AI server demand is strong. Demand has stabilized for our traditional server and storage products, and our HPE GreenLake momentum is robust. We will continue to invest in IT inflections, networking, hybrid cloud and AI to drive our pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue. I look forward to engaging with you in the months ahead, as does our new Chief Strategy Officer, Shannon Cross, who has joined us following a distinguished career as a Wall Street analyst and now has oversight of our IR function.  We will appreciate your input and questions along the way, and we can get started with that right now. I'll open it up now for your questions about the quarter.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall : Great, thanks. Maybe on the GPU available -- GPU delays that you're seeing and far as acceptance. Just what are you seeing in terms of -- you identified that power and some of these things were conditions for what the delays were. But just what are you seeing in terms of how long those delays are going to take and how long the delays and the acceptances are going to be?\nAntonio Neri : Well, thank you, Meta. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we had a couple of deals that slipped from Q1 into future quarters because customers are taking a little bit longer to prepare the data center space, getting the power and the cooling ready. And obviously, those deals will come as we complete those installations.  And then on the GPU side, obviously, we continue to experience a tight environment, although we are seeing some improvements. We have already a lot of GPUs that we already built but the customers will take time to accept those systems. But the reality is that we need more supply against the backlog that we announced today, which was $3 billion at the end of the Q1.  So that's what we see today. And as we go forward, we expect that improvement to happen, and that's why we are confident on the conversion of the GPU orders into revenue as we go along, not just because of the GPU availability but also the acceptances.\nShannon Cross: Great, thank you very much, Meta. Gary, can we have the next question?\nOperator: And the next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Antonio, maybe just talk about, if I look at the revenue shortfall in Jan quarter, how much of that do you think is because your customers are pushing out their delivery schedules, they don't have power versus you just didn't have enough GPUs? If you were to think about those two buckets.  And then as you think about the full year guide, perhaps I didn't appreciate this, but can you just talk about what are you expecting for the networking segment, Intelligent Edge to do in the zero to 2% guide right now? Thank you. \nMarie Myers : Hey, Amit, good afternoon. Nice to hear from you. So I'll take -- I'll answer the first part of your question around the revenue. So in the first quarter with respect to what drove the $300 million on the revenue, it was mostly actually networking. We did have one deal that moved out. I think Antonio mentioned that in his prepared remarks.  And then in terms of just how we're thinking about the second half of the guide, we are expecting a very strong second half, and that's predominantly driven actually by AI systems revenue. We are expecting networking to be slightly more favorable in the back half, but we really see the trough of networking in Q2, Amit.\nShannon Cross: Great, Gary. Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question?\nOperator: And the next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could drill down a little bit in terms of understanding what's changed in the Intelligent Edge versus 90 days ago. And two elements are crossing my mind. One is really around the pending Juniper deal, whether that's influencing customers to maybe hold off purchases because of the uncertainties that might be affecting their decision-making as to what happens after you're combined.  And the other part is just wondering if there's inventory that's been sitting in the channel, why didn't you know about it or why didn't you see it? Just trying to get an understanding of sort of what you've learned over these last 90 days. Thank you. \nAntonio Neri : Thank you, Simon. So first of all, we saw an acceleration of the demand softness in the back -- at the end of the Q1, really in January, whether it's now people coming back, but obviously, the reality is we saw that as a headwind to our revenue in Q1. I have to say, we do not have a channel inventory problem. Actually, we are in great position, particularly from the enterprise customers and the enterprise product, we do not have that issue at this point in time. What we do see is customers are taking longer with the product we already shipped to them to install it and eventually go through the next cycle. And that's why we said with Marie, we're going to start seeing a slight improvement in the back half with Q2 being the trough. And part of the back half also is the traditional buying season in the United States with state and local education. The pipeline is very good.  We have not lost one single deal that I can point to, neither because of the slowdown or customers deferring, not because of the announcement of the acquisition of Juniper.\nMarie Myers : And maybe, Simon, just to add to Antonio's comments, the only place where we saw a slightly elevated pocket of inventory was in SMB, which is a pretty small part of our business.\nAntonio Neri : Yeah.\nShannon Cross: Thank you, Simon. Gary, can we have the next question?\nOperator: And the next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. Sorry, I just have one clarification and a question. Marie, on the [Indiscernible] that the backlog dropdown has contributed, I think, mid-single digits to the Intelligent Edge or something more broad than that? So can you just comment or clarify exactly what the backlog contribution was? And I suppose there's none going forward. And then just on my question, you sound pretty excited about sequential growth over the course of the year, both in servers and storage. Maybe you can just elaborate on why you see that. Is servers -- do you see sequential growth in traditional servers, non-accelerated [indiscernible]. Thank you. \nMarie Myers : Hi, Toni. So, good afternoon. So maybe I'll take the first part of the question, and I'll turn to Antonio for the second part. So look, in terms of the backlog, we really don't disclose the backlog on edge. But I think what we've said is that we've seen our backlog sort of revert back to normalized levels with the exception, obviously, of our APU or AI system. So that's how we're thinking about the backlog. I think in terms of just some context and commentary, you've seen in the industry that the market has definitely softened. And I think as Antonio said earlier, we saw that late in the quarter. So that's how we characterize the networking demand. And I would say that we do expect the trough in Q2 and to be slightly more favorable in the back half. So that's how we're thinking about the networking market playing out for the year.  I think I'll turn to Antonio to comment to servers.\nAntonio Neri : Yeah, Toni. Thank you for the question. So on the server and server side, obviously, we see signs of stabilization now, has been now a couple of quarters with sequential order improvement. But the reality is that, as we said in our opening remarks, we continue to see the mix shift in the traditional servers, as you call it, to Gen11. By the end of the year, we should be approximately 60% of the way there. Obviously, those services come with a different set of structural configurations and pricing, which obviously is higher. At the same time, we're going to see cost inflation. We believe that's going to be the case, and therefore, we have to eventually pass those as well. But the number of units have been very stable or slightly improving. And that's an important indicator because ultimately, that also drives our attach rate of our Operational Services, which in the quarter was very, very good. So that's why we are confident that sequential improvement from here on. And then on the storage side, obviously, AI is going to be a pull-through demand for us. We introduced a new offer now specifically for file. And remember that HP Electra continue to grow from here on. And a portion of that HP Electra revenue is also in the ARR because remember that software now is completely disaggregated from the solution itself, which means you have the CapEx portion of the revenue recognized in quarter and the subscription part of the software amortized over the period of the contract.  So that's why ARR is growing because of the subscription in networking, which was up significantly, the storage and obviously, AI now also contributing to the ARR as well.\nShannon Cross: Thank you, Toni. Gary, can we have the next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the server market. Maybe two parts. I guess when we look at some of your peers, I mean, it seems to be that the lead times have improved on some of the GPUs, particularly the H100. I'd be curious of kind of like can you talk a little bit about what you've seen on lead times there in terms of your ability to deliver on some of this backlog? How that's changed over the course of this last quarter?  And then any thoughts on traditional server recovery? How do we think about the pace of that embedded in your expectations looking through this year?\nAntonio Neri : Yeah, sure. I think I covered the larger part of that question with Toni's question about sequential improvement in the traditional server, which is still very CPU-centric. On a combined server, right, now 25% of the total volume is APUs, which obviously GPU is the biggest portion of it. So we expect that sequential improvement driven by recovery in demand in units and then obviously, the shift to Gen11, which is important in this transition. On the GPU lead times, they have come down but it's still elevated. We're talking about 20-plus weeks at least lead time. And so -- and then it's going to be a combination of multiple type of GPUs, right, because there is still demand for the prior generation to H100. Obviously, the majority of the demand today is on H100. And going forward, we're going to have the Grace Hopper H200 and others, right, including MI 300x and the like. And the difference for us is that because we have a unique network in interconnect fabric, we can support all of them. So that's an important differentiation that I think everyone needs to remind because while a lot of the volume today is NVIDIA and then on the supercomputing, which is also an AI business, by the way, we support all three of them. And so that, for us, gives us the optionality to convert the orders that we have and future orders we see in the pipeline with a little bit more flexibility, I will say.\nShannon Cross: Thank you, Aaron. Gary, can we have the next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you so much. You said some of your demand in AI systems is coming in, we had GreenLake. Can you help us understand the linkage between your view of AI revenue and ARR growth?\nAntonio Neri : Yeah, Wamsi. I can start and Marie, feel free to add. I mean, the fact of the matter is that when you look at that $4 billion cumulative orders, a significant portion is going to go through the HPE GreenLake. If you recall last year, I announced that a hyperscaler placed an order with us, and that order is going through the GreenLake platform. And so that's why you see a breakdown over time of the AI GPU orders going through the ARR, which is fine. Ultimately, they give us the ability to attach other services, which is important to remember here, because remember, when it goes to the HPE GreenLake, in many cases, we are actually running those systems for the customer.  It's not just shipping the system to the customer. We actually put it in a location, whereas our data center footprint with our cooling and power, and then we attach our services, which are the run time plus other things we do. And why it's important also the growth in ARR because that drives margin expansion and accretion over time. So that's what's going on in addition to the fact that, obviously, now we crossed 31,000 customers on HPE GreenLake platform.  To put it in context, Wamsi, that's almost 3,000 customers in one quarter. I mean, 8% up quarter-over-quarter, 3,000 customers. And everything we do from the software perspective, it now is a subscription whether you sell HPE ProLiant Gen11, let's say, an AI-optimized server, the software to connect the server actually runs to GreenLake. Obviously, software runs through the GreenLake. A lot of the Aruba software, including Aruba Central, a subscription and now you have AI as well.\nMarie Myers : And maybe Wamsi, I'll just put a couple of numbers around the APU or the AI system orders that we saw, too. So we ended the quarter actually with $3 billion in backlog, so we really nearly tripled actually year-on-year. And in terms of just the link back to ARR, we shipped around $400 million in revenue but we had incremental revenue actually that went into ARR. And that sort of underscores the growth that we saw in ARR and expect to see going forward as well, Wamsi.\nShannon Cross: Thank you, Wamsi. Gary, can we have the next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess, Antonio, you referenced the increase in demand on AI that you see related to inferencing workloads on the enterprise side. Can you maybe talk a bit in terms of how these deployments are looking different to what you've been doing on the AI training side and maybe with some hyperscalers? And given the lead times, is this demand going to more materialize in relation to revenue more in fiscal '25 or is that just a fair estimate about, given the lead times? Thank you. \nAntonio Neri : Yeah. No, thank you. That's an excellent question. Obviously, I spoke about the AI life cycle, training, tuning, and inferencing. Obviously, the training side has been more focused on the hyperscalers, so Tier 2, Tier 3 type of providers or companies that are funded well to build these large language models.  But when you look at enterprise, most of the enterprises are going to take a model and fine-tune it to give a context to the model with their data. And that, it can happen in multiple locations, right? It can happen in the data centers or potentially in a Coles or in some cases in the public cloud, but we see more focus on where they can control the data in a secure environment. And then the inferencing side, it can happen in a data center or in a public cloud once they are all trained but also at the edge. In fact, we showcase a lot of the inferencing cases at the edge in Mobile Congress at the edge of the network. Think about use cases like the Coles Supermarket, right? So there is a lot of data to the video footage captured in the stores. That video footage needs to be inferenced right there at that given moment with 0 latency in order to deliver the outcome. And there are in manufacturing and the like. And in fact, one of the use cases we saw also for inferencing is a large bank that now are doing some fine-tuning and inferencing to do risk management and other things. So we -- I will say we are kind of getting into it. I will say the growth will happen in the second half in '25. Definitely, the lead times will play a role. But I'm very encouraged about the momentum we see and the opportunity we have also with the combination of Juniper because most of these inferencing requires the network connectivity to deliver it. And that to me is one of the reasons why we went ahead with that acquisition.\nShannon Cross: Thank you, Samik. Gary, can we have the next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long : Thank you. Just on the -- another one on the AI server side. Can you talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about profitability for the businesses as we get more accelerated compute in your servers? And if you can also kind of break that down between maybe the Cray businesses and the standard compute? Is there going to be more of a margin gap in those two businesses when looking at more traditional going to accelerated? Thank you. \nAntonio Neri : Sure, I can start. I will say, listen, I think if you look at our server segment that we just published, we delivered very strong performance. I mean, we are in the target range we committed well back of 11% to 13%. And that -- the fact that we're bringing together give us the flexibility, opportunity to maximize the blended margin here as we go forward. To give a reference, when you sell an EX system, generally it's a liquid cool system that tends to gravitate to the supercomputing side or large AI clusters of thousands of GPUs. But an EX system supports today up to 80,000 GPUs in one system, and that's because of our interconnect fabric HPE Slingshot. In fact, some of those systems have 80,000 GPUs and maybe 40,000 CPUs in one system. But then you have other customers are many 2,000 or 4,000 GPUs. And depending on which location they pick, they need liquid cooling, we deploy those.  Now generally speaking, the XD platform, the Cray XD platform is the one that has the density and is more oriented and ability to mix much different configurations, and that's where the vast majority of the action is today in AI. And ProLiant Gen11 actually is more used for inferencing or in some areas of fine-tuning as well.  So we have the flexibility to meet all those demands with our unique IP. And on top of that, we actually lay our machine learning development environment. In fact, there are customers that come to us just for the MLDE environment. Later on, we pull the server. Now on AUPs, I will you that when you sell an XD, the can be 20 times the value of a traditional server with CPUs. And in EX, it can be up to 35 times. And so as we go forward, the ability to optimize margin through the configs and attach the services, whether it's our data center services plus the software and the Operational Services allows us to really drive the best outcome for our shareholders.\nShannon Cross: Thank you, Tim. Gary, we'll take one final question.\nOperator: And that final question will come from Lou Miscioscia from Daiwa Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nLouis Miscioscia : Hey, thank you for taking my question. Antonio, I guess the question I have is since you're talking a lot about data centers, I'm wondering what's going to happen is that the vast majority of x86 applications going to start to shift over to really be accelerated with GPUs due to the concern of more coming to end?  And what I'm asking is not really inference and it's not training. These are just normal applications, sort of like the same way architectures shifted from IBM mainframes or PA years and years ago to x86 eventually to that and cloud. Do you think that, that's going to shift over to running on GPUs?\nAntonio Neri : Well, thank you for the question. I think we need to understand there are two worlds that will coexist. There is the cloud-native world. Think about the cloud-native world where you have thousands and thousands of applications running on thousands and thousands of servers and they share everything. That architecture will exist for a long, long time because it's cost efficient. And the realization is that those applications world were designed for that type of environment, for the traditional monolithic approach to more a cloud-centric approach. And then you have these AI applications where you may have one application, only one, running on thousands and thousands of servers, which have accelerated compute. And it's a little bit far-fetched to say everything is going to move there. I argue that you will have inferencing solutions that a CPU will be just fine. Think about your phone, right? The phone will have, at some point, the ability to manage a large language model, let's say, 20 billion or 30 billion parameters, or the PC, maybe in the 80 billion to 100 billion parameters.  But when you go up higher than that, obviously, you need potentially a server at the edge. And what I'll call 8-way GPU will be the right way to go.  So I argue there will be a mix in the transition here for a long period of time. Not everything will go to a GPU. It also depends how these large language models and all the AI applications get constructed. Now you asked us -- you made another interesting point which I want to make sure the -- all of you remember. We, as a company, have two now public instances of AI, power with renewal energies where we are supporting some of these customers, including a hyperscaler. And going forward, enterprise customers because they don't have the space and the cooling and the understanding how to run the system of scale.  That's a unique differentiation Hewlett Packard Enterprise have in addition to build systems and ship them. And I think that's an opportunity for us because that will drive stickiness to our HPE GreenLake platform, which obviously will drive recurring revenues but better attach software and services down the road. And Juniper will play a huge role in that environment.\nShannon Cross: Thank you, Lou. Let me now turn it back to Antonio for concluding remarks.\nAntonio Neri : Well, thank you, Shannon. And thank you, everyone. I know you have been covering multiple calls today. I know it's late on the East Coast, but I will leave you with a few comments. Number one, we have the right strategy and the right team at the right time. This quarter, obviously, it was a little bit mixed because of the revenue. But remember, a lot of revenue also went through the ARR so we need to understand that implication going forward. I'm very confident about the future. And the moves we have made and continue to make, including the Juniper acquisition, will allow us to participate in this inflection point with a unique IP. Everybody, obviously, is focused about this AI momentum and the server side, but you need more than servers. AI will drive the need for more ports. That means you need more networking bandwidth. That's for sure. Also, let's not forget, we need to do this responsibly. One of the things I'm really proud about our company is the commitment to social responsibility. Doing all of this, addressing the sustainability and the ethical challenges and the responsibility around AI. But listen, just we came out two weeks ago where HP was ranked number one in the Just Capital, ranking something that when you are proud of it and I know shareholder value, all of that. We have to take some actions here. We are really focused on the strong execution and discipline, something we have shown now for six years plus. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m confident in the adjusted guidance we provided with Marie. And as we get into \u201825, obviously with the pending acquisition, I feel HPE will be even in a stronger position as we get through 2024. So thank you for your time and hope to connect with you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marie Myers",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio. I'm pleased to be with you today on my first earnings call as HPE's CFO. I've long admired HPE's impressive transformation, and there has never been a more exciting time to be part of this company. We have a growing addressable market, a proven strategy and a differentiated portfolio that is levered to long-term market trends around networking, hybrid cloud and AI. I believe we have a significant opportunity ahead of us. I'm excited to partner with Antonio and the rest of the outstanding HPE team to capitalize on this opportunity and drive value for our shareholders. And as Antonio mentioned, we have much to be proud of. Financial highlights in the quarter included record gross margins and expense discipline, which helped lift non-GAAP EPS to the high end of our guidance range. Demand for our traditional server and storage products has stabilized. Demand for our HPE GreenLake offerings was evident in a healthy ARR growth and demand for our AI systems remains robust.  However, demand in Intelligent Edge did soften due to customer digestion of strong product shipments in fiscal year '23, which is lasting longer than we initially anticipated and is the primary reason Q1 revenue came in below our expectations. GPU availability and deal timing also contributed. We are taking swift action to address these headwinds by curtailing costs and driving efficiencies across the business. With that, let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Revenue fell 14% year-over-year in constant currency to $6.8 billion. Please recall, we had significant backlog consumption in Q1 '23, particularly in traditional servers and storage. Backlog has now largely normalized across our business with the exception of our APU products.  We have strong momentum in HPE GreenLake. ARR exceeded $1.4 billion in Q1. Storage and networking software and services are the fastest growth elements of ARR. Our software and services mix rose 400 basis points year-over-year to 69%. ARR is the best indicator of our model transformation to our as-a-service offerings. This growth validates what our customers are telling us, that HPE GreenLake is a differentiated value proposition in the market. Our Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 36.2%. It rose 200 basis points year-over-year, driven by a mix shift to Intelligent Edge and favorable input cost management. We are pleased that our non-GAAP gross margin is up 600 basis points from fiscal year '18 to a company record. This illustrates the ongoing pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue across our portfolio.  Given the current networking market dynamics, we are taking this moment to streamline and simplify our operations. We are focused on controlling the things we can control. Prudent cost management and disciplined execution are important regardless of the macro environment and are even more critical at times like these. The benefits of our focus are already evident in our Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses, which declined 4.7% year-over-year at 9.5% sequentially to $1.7 billion. The strong Q1 non-GAAP gross margins and OpEx discipline led to Q1 non-GAAP operating margins of 11.5%, which is down only 30 basis points year-over-year despite less revenue scale.  Favorable timing on some corporate expenses was a tailwind to Q1 operating expense and will appear in Q2. GAAP EPS of $0.29 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.48 exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. Our diluted share count was approximately 1.3 billion, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exclude $251 million in costs primarily from stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and noncash loss on investments. As we manage the business with focus and discipline, we will also invest to capitalize on the sizable opportunities associated with moving through the interrelated inflection points in networking, hybrid cloud, and AI all at the same time. HPE is evolving into a more simple, more agile company that is even better positioned to pursue our growth opportunities and to evolve our mix of products, services and software and to drive structural higher profitability. Turning to our segment results. In addition to the new segments we discussed at SAM, we also created a new service segment that combines our prior compute and HPC and AI segment under one streamlined segment that offers solutions for our customers' training, tuning, and inferencing AI needs across the AI life cycle. Server revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter, which was down 23% year-over-year. This new segment had a difficult year-over-year compare as in Q1 '23, the business made significant progress against its backlog and benefit from HPE Cray EX revenue for Frontier. We are capturing the robust growth in AI demand. Our cumulative APU orders since Q1 '23, which include APU attached products and services in our HPE Cray EX XD and ProLiant Systems, rose approximately sequentially to now $4 billion. Our pipeline is robust and GPU supply, while still constrained, is improving.  Our APU product revenue increased sequentially to well over $400 million. We are now converting our APU orders into revenues, and yet very strong demand means our APU backlog is over $3 billion. Our pipeline is well above that. AI revenue in the quarter included our first revenues from AI cloud offering and from our HPE GreenLake win with a large hyperscale customer. Our traditional high-performance computing and supercomputing revenue fell seasonally, sequentially following a strong Q4.  Revenue from our traditional server business increased sequentially. We expect this trend to continue, given a structural mix shift to higher AUP Gen11 and rising input costs. General servers nearly doubled sequentially to 30% of the mix in Q1. Including HPE, Cray XD takes the mix of next-generation servers to 44%. We are encouraged that our Gen11 pipeline is starting to include AI inferencing activity and enterprise applications.  We expect AI inferencing to gather momentum in fiscal year '24. As a reminder, our Gen11 services come with an attached subscription to our compute ops management software, which lifts our margin structure.  Our Q1 operating margin was 11.4%. While up sequentially, the margin was down 430 basis points year-over-year, given declining revenues. Intelligent Edge revenues were $1.2 billion or up 2% year-over-year. Demand for our campus switching and Wi-Fi products eased materially, particularly in Europe and Asia, and was the largest contributor to our Q1 revenue gap. We continue to see mid-single-digit growth benefits from our existing backlog but expect it to normalize going forward as we are now approaching our typical range. Our total channel inventory is within the normal range overall, inclusive of a pocket in the SMB business. We also continue to make progress in our new TAMs of data center networking, private 5G and SASE. The Intelligent Edge portfolio of subscription revenue grew well above 50% as we are benefiting from growing attach from our strong fiscal year '23 revenue growth.  We are pleased with our 29.4% operating margin, which was up 1,000 basis points year-over-year. The new hybrid cloud segment includes our storage businesses and now the HPE GreenLake portion of our server business. Revenues of $1.2 billion were down 10% year-over-year. Our traditional storage business was down year-over-year on difficult compares, given backlog consumption in Q1 '23. Total Electro subscription revenue grew over 100% year-over-year and is an illustration of our long-term transition to an as-a-service model across our businesses. We are starting to see AI server demand pull through interest in our file storage portfolio. We are also already seeing some cross-selling benefits of integrating the majority of our HPE GreenLake offering into a single business unit. Our operating margin was 3.8%, which was down 200 basis points year-over-year. Lower revenues and a high mix of third-party product impacted margins in the traditional storage business. Our HPE Financial Services revenue was down 2% year-over-year and financing volume was $1.4 billion. Our operating margin of 8.5% was up 130 basis points year-over-year. We are successfully passing through interest rate increases, and our asset management margins are returning to normal. Our Q1 loss ratio remained steady at 0.5%. Turning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $64 million in cash flow from operations and consumed $482 million in free cash flow this quarter. HPE typically consumes cash in the first half of the year and generates cash in the second half. Our first quarter free cash flow benefited from some prepayments associated with pending HPE GreenLake deals at HPE Cray XD shipments.  Our cash conversion cycle was seven days, which is a reduction of eight days from Q1 '23. Our days payable and days of inventory were both higher, given the lower revenue and strong demand for APUs. We returned $172 million in capital to shareholders in Q1, primarily through our dividend. Before I discuss our outlook, let me first recap the key drivers that factor into our expectations for Q2 and the full year. For server, we expect improving GPU supply to drive sequential revenue increases through fiscal year '24. Given improving supply and the timing of installations, we expect segment revenue and therefore, corporate revenue to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. We expect the blended margin of the new segment to be flattish for the remainder of the fiscal year. For Intelligent Edge, we expect the market to remain soft throughout the year. Our cost reduction efforts will take time to show their benefits, which will result in margin pressure in Q2. Later in our fiscal year, we expect our normal channel inventory position and seasonal strength in the education market to be a modest revenue tailwind. We expect the full year margin to be in the mid-20% range.  For hybrid cloud, we expect sequential increases through the year as our traditional storage business improves and HPE GreenLake momentum continues. We expect meaningful progress through the year. With that context, let me turn to our outlook. For Q2, we expect revenues in the range of $6.6 billion to $7 billion or up slightly sequentially at the midpoint. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.20 and $0.25 and our non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.36 and $0.41. In part, given the higher prepayments in Q1, we expect negative free cash flow in Q2.  Let me remind you that we have two drivers of potential lumpiness in our business. One is the timing and customer acceptances of large Cray wins, including Cray XD wins, which should ramp beginning in Q2. The second is the start of certain large HPE GreenLake deals. For some of these large deals, our segments recognize the related hardware on installation. In our consolidated results, we eliminate the segment revenue and recognize it over time. Both large deals and higher eliminations are indicators of our confidence in the second half of the fiscal year.  For fiscal year '24, we are revising our outlook, primarily given the current networking market headwinds. Let me remind you that we are excluding the H3C earnings and gain on sale from our non-GAAP results beginning in fiscal year '24. We now expect revised ranges for constant currency revenue and non-GAAP operating profit growth of zero to 2%. GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.81 to $1.91 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.82 to $1.92. The mix shift from Intelligent Edge to server should also weigh on our gross margins.  We now expect the full year non-GAAP gross margin to be slightly down from our prior full year expectation of 35%. We expect the impact of the cost actions we have initiated to materialize in the second half and leave fiscal year '24 OpEx to be flat to down from fiscal '23 OpEx. We expect our operating margin to be flattish year-over-year. We now expect OI&E to be $200 million to $250 million headwind versus our prior $300 million expectation, given better Q1 free cash flow and more favorable interest rate assumptions. We expect the effect on currency to be immaterial. We expect free cash flow to be at least $1.9 billion in fiscal year '24. We expect significantly stronger free cash flow in the second half of the year led by improvements in inventories as AI service shipments ramp. We reiterate our commitment to our dividend, which was raised 8% from fiscal year '23 to fiscal year '24. Debt repayment to maintain an investment-grade credit rating, and in long term, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, we executed well in Q1 amidst a challenging market backdrop. We are pleased with our margin and EPS results while understanding our slower networking product demand and GPU availability and timing impacted our revenue performance. We have taken prompt action to further reduce our costs and continue to manage our expenses prudently while we advance our long-term strategy.  AI server demand is strong. Demand has stabilized for our traditional server and storage products, and our HPE GreenLake momentum is robust. We will continue to invest in IT inflections, networking, hybrid cloud and AI to drive our pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue. I look forward to engaging with you in the months ahead, as does our new Chief Strategy Officer, Shannon Cross, who has joined us following a distinguished career as a Wall Street analyst and now has oversight of our IR function.  We will appreciate your input and questions along the way, and we can get started with that right now. I'll open it up now for your questions about the quarter. Hey, Amit, good afternoon. Nice to hear from you. So I'll take -- I'll answer the first part of your question around the revenue. So in the first quarter with respect to what drove the $300 million on the revenue, it was mostly actually networking. We did have one deal that moved out. I think Antonio mentioned that in his prepared remarks.  And then in terms of just how we're thinking about the second half of the guide, we are expecting a very strong second half, and that's predominantly driven actually by AI systems revenue. We are expecting networking to be slightly more favorable in the back half, but we really see the trough of networking in Q2, Amit. And maybe, Simon, just to add to Antonio's comments, the only place where we saw a slightly elevated pocket of inventory was in SMB, which is a pretty small part of our business. Hi, Toni. So, good afternoon. So maybe I'll take the first part of the question, and I'll turn to Antonio for the second part. So look, in terms of the backlog, we really don't disclose the backlog on edge. But I think what we've said is that we've seen our backlog sort of revert back to normalized levels with the exception, obviously, of our APU or AI system. So that's how we're thinking about the backlog. I think in terms of just some context and commentary, you've seen in the industry that the market has definitely softened. And I think as Antonio said earlier, we saw that late in the quarter. So that's how we characterize the networking demand. And I would say that we do expect the trough in Q2 and to be slightly more favorable in the back half. So that's how we're thinking about the networking market playing out for the year.  I think I'll turn to Antonio to comment to servers. And maybe Wamsi, I'll just put a couple of numbers around the APU or the AI system orders that we saw, too. So we ended the quarter actually with $3 billion in backlog, so we really nearly tripled actually year-on-year. And in terms of just the link back to ARR, we shipped around $400 million in revenue but we had incremental revenue actually that went into ARR. And that sort of underscores the growth that we saw in ARR and expect to see going forward as well, Wamsi."

            "name": "Antonio Neri",
            "content": "Thank you, Shannon. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we are proud to have outpaced our profitability expectations while advancing our long-term strategy. We also continue to scale our recurring revenue, achieving the second highest year-over-year growth rate since we started tracking ARR in late 2019. This is a promising indicator for our ongoing portfolio shift to higher-margin revenues. But overall, Q1 revenue performance did not meet our expectations. During this call, I will address three key points. First, I will touch on our revenue, which was lower than expected in large part because network and demand softened industry-wide and because the timing of several large GPU acceptances shifted. Additionally, we did not have the GPU supply we wanted, curtailing our revenue upside.  Second, I will address how we are streamlining our reporting segments, accelerating a new specialized sales model, managing our spending and reinforcing execution discipline. Third and most importantly, I will discuss the progress we're making in executing our long-term strategy, which we remain confident in. Let me first address revenue in the quarter. Similar to peers in the market, we saw campus networking product demand weakened and the decline later in the quarter was greater than expected. This was a large headwind relative to our expectations. Customers are taking longer to digest prior orders than we had anticipated, which partially offset the benefit of our backlog entering the quarter. And Europe and Asia were areas of relative softness. We expect weakness in the networking market to persist, which is likely to impact revenue through fiscal year 2024. That said, we anticipate some improvement late in fiscal year 2024 as inventory clears and we ramp into the purchasing season for state and local education customers in the United States. AI server demand remains very strong, evidenced by our growing cumulative order book. However, GPU availability remains tight, and our delivery timing has also been affected by the increasing length of time customers require to set up the data center space, power and cooling requirements needed to run these systems.  As a result, overall AI server orders conversion was below our expectations. However, the AI contribution to ARR is increasing. We continue to prioritize profitability. I am pleased that we have delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 36.2%, which is up 200 basis points year-over-year and above 600 basis points from fiscal year 2018. This performance helped our Q1 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share grow to $0.48, which was above the midpoint of our guidance range despite lower-than-expected revenue, illustrating the positive impact of our pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue.  We know that the current environment will require continued discipline in how we execute. We are accelerating new specialized sales motions to maximize opportunities and improve order linearity across our portfolio. Improved cost management will remain an important competency for us in fiscal year 2024.  We also found opportunity to streamline our reporting segments. We have now combined the Compute and HPC and AI segments into a single server segment that integrates general-purpose computing, high-performance computing, supercomputing, and AI systems. This will enable us to maximize the opportunities across the entire AI life cycle, from training to tuning to inferencing and execute with agility.  And as previously discussed, we have simplified our hybrid cloud strategy by putting all related products, software and services into one business unit. Our new hybrid cloud segment will further accelerate customer adoption of the HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform. Turning to our strategy. While we are experiencing cyclicality in submarkets, I am more confident than ever in our long-term strategy that is aligned to key market mega trends. In edge, over the last several quarters, we have gained share in the campus networking markets and our strategic investments have played off. Most recently, we have seen strong growth in SASE, an offering bolstered by our acquisition of Silver Peak in 2020 and Axis Security in 2023. Our sales pipeline for our private 5G offering is also growing rapidly, following our acquisition of Athonet in 2023. In hybrid cloud, HPE GreenLake continues to resonate in the marketplace and was the private driver of the highest Q1 year-over-year rise in ARR over the 4-plus years we have been reporting it. Our ARR grew 41% year-over-year to more than $1.4 billion in Q1, and we continue to expect ARR growth of 35% to 45% as we look ahead. We're also capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities when customers come to us for our AI solutions and realize we can meet their storage needs as well. In AI, we are capturing the explosion in demand for AI systems. Our cumulative accelerator processing unit orders rose to $4 billion in the quarter, driven by demand across HPE Cray EX and XT solutions, as well as HPE ProLiant Gen11 AI-optimized servers. AP orders represent nearly 25% of our total server orders since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our pipeline is large and growing across the entire AI life cycle from training to tuning to inferencing. We are starting to see AI demand pull-through for other solutions, including storage. We expect our server and hybrid cloud segments to grow sequentially through the fiscal year. Server revenue stands to benefit from AI system demand, improving GPU supply, and our continued mix shift to HPE ProLiant Gen11. Hybrid cloud will benefit from continued HPE GreenLake storage demand and the rising productivity of our specialized sales force.  Our customers continue to validate our value proposition. As one example, we are building for A&E, one of the world's largest energy providers, a new HPE Cray EX supercomputer that will reach more than half an exaflop performance. The system will be one of the most powerful in the world for enterprise use and will accelerate AI-driven scientific discovery to advance efforts in energy. We also have been awarded the deal for Poland's most powerful supercomputer system located at the Academic Computer Center Cipher Net of the AGH University of Science and Technology. Based on the HPE Cray EX supercomputer and HPE Slingshot Interconnect Fabric with NVIDIA Grace Hopper GPUs, the system will be used to support modeling simulation and AI-driven scientific research needs, including training and tuning of large language models. We're also seeing growth in AI inferencing. For example, Coles Supermarkets, a leading Australian retailer, implemented an HPE ProLiant Gen11 AI inferencing solution in Q1, which helps with video imaging to reduce store stock lost to theft and scanning at the checkout. In the quarter, we expanded our strategic collaboration with NVIDIA targeting the enterprise segment of the market. We introduced a preconfigured solution for enterprise customers to fine-tune AI large language models with their private data to accelerate inferencing. Our HPE machine learning development environment software and unique HPE supercomputer and IP are critical parts of the solution, alongside NVIDIA AI enterprise software. We have built a strong and growing sales pipeline for this new offering. We also continue to build out our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform services. Earlier this quarter, we announced an expanded HPE GreenLake for file storage that is designed for generative AI. This solution is highly differentiated through a high-performant file system solution specifically designed for AI applications. We believe it better positions us to take market share in storage by addressing the previously underserved segment of the file market.  Innovation like this continue to attract customers to HPE GreenLake platform, which connects 3.8 million network devices and supports more than 31,000 customer organizations, up approximately 8% from last quarter. One new HPE GreenLake customer is the U.S. Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, which produces critical models of weather and ocean conditions for the U.S. and coalition forces worldwide. They turned to HPE GreenLake to improve predictability, accuracy and speed of their modeling while reducing costs.  This week, I attended the Mobile World Congress where AI and private 5G were the key topics among telcos and service providers alike. With our pending acquisition of Juniper Networks, HPE's portfolio will expand to better serve these unique customers from the edge of the network to core 5G to cloud. Customers were very interested in our integration of Athonet private 5G capabilities into our Intelligent Edge portfolio as well as in our cloud OpenRAN and VRAN solutions. They were also very eager to explore the massive new market opportunity AI inferencing presents at the edge of the network.  That is one of the reasons why we're so excited about our pending Juniper Networks acquisition. Combining our complementary portfolios will supercharge HPE's edge-to-cloud strategy, accelerating our entire portfolio with AI-enabled innovation. When our proposed acquisition closes, we will create a new networking innovator, with our comprehensive portfolio for and partners. The transaction is expected to double the size of our networking business, which will be the core foundation of covering the anticipated $180 billion market opportunity with our combined IP.  From a financial perspective, this transaction is also compelling for our shareholders. In the first year post close, we expect accretion to non-GAAP earnings per share and, in the long term, higher non-GAAP gross and operating margins. We are working to secure regulatory approvals in several jurisdictions. We are hopeful that regulators will recognize that this acquisition is centered around driving further innovation for our customers. We continue to expect that the transaction will close later this calendar year or in early calendar 2025. In summary, Q1 2024 was a mixed quarter for HPE. We achieved strong profitability and drove new record ARR growth with overall revenue short-term expectations, given the softening networking market, GPU deal timing and, to some extent, GPU availability. We are focused on execution as we navigate the fluctuations demand we see in certain areas of the market.  Marie will take you through our adjusted guidance, which reflects our latest thinking about the year ahead. This quarter is a moment in time and does not at all dampen our confidence in the future ahead of us. We have taken the right actions to maximize value for our shareholders. The work we are doing now, combined with our technological edge and our strategy that has never been more relevant, will position us to convert on the long-term opportunities in front of us across edge, hybrid cloud, and AI. Before we transition, I'm delighted to welcome Marie Myers as our new CFO. Having worked with her at HP before the separation, it is a pleasure to partner with her again. I am passion for and skill ad, fueling innovation and performance. I am confident that Marie is a great fit for this role and expect she will help drive the next phase of growth and shareholder return for HPE.  I will now turn the call over to her for details about our segments and our outlook. Marie? Well, thank you, Meta. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we had a couple of deals that slipped from Q1 into future quarters because customers are taking a little bit longer to prepare the data center space, getting the power and the cooling ready. And obviously, those deals will come as we complete those installations.  And then on the GPU side, obviously, we continue to experience a tight environment, although we are seeing some improvements. We have already a lot of GPUs that we already built but the customers will take time to accept those systems. But the reality is that we need more supply against the backlog that we announced today, which was $3 billion at the end of the Q1.  So that's what we see today. And as we go forward, we expect that improvement to happen, and that's why we are confident on the conversion of the GPU orders into revenue as we go along, not just because of the GPU availability but also the acceptances. Thank you, Simon. So first of all, we saw an acceleration of the demand softness in the back -- at the end of the Q1, really in January, whether it's now people coming back, but obviously, the reality is we saw that as a headwind to our revenue in Q1. I have to say, we do not have a channel inventory problem. Actually, we are in great position, particularly from the enterprise customers and the enterprise product, we do not have that issue at this point in time. What we do see is customers are taking longer with the product we already shipped to them to install it and eventually go through the next cycle. And that's why we said with Marie, we're going to start seeing a slight improvement in the back half with Q2 being the trough. And part of the back half also is the traditional buying season in the United States with state and local education. The pipeline is very good.  We have not lost one single deal that I can point to, neither because of the slowdown or customers deferring, not because of the announcement of the acquisition of Juniper. Yeah. Yeah, Toni. Thank you for the question. So on the server and server side, obviously, we see signs of stabilization now, has been now a couple of quarters with sequential order improvement. But the reality is that, as we said in our opening remarks, we continue to see the mix shift in the traditional servers, as you call it, to Gen11. By the end of the year, we should be approximately 60% of the way there. Obviously, those services come with a different set of structural configurations and pricing, which obviously is higher. At the same time, we're going to see cost inflation. We believe that's going to be the case, and therefore, we have to eventually pass those as well. But the number of units have been very stable or slightly improving. And that's an important indicator because ultimately, that also drives our attach rate of our Operational Services, which in the quarter was very, very good. So that's why we are confident that sequential improvement from here on. And then on the storage side, obviously, AI is going to be a pull-through demand for us. We introduced a new offer now specifically for file. And remember that HP Electra continue to grow from here on. And a portion of that HP Electra revenue is also in the ARR because remember that software now is completely disaggregated from the solution itself, which means you have the CapEx portion of the revenue recognized in quarter and the subscription part of the software amortized over the period of the contract.  So that's why ARR is growing because of the subscription in networking, which was up significantly, the storage and obviously, AI now also contributing to the ARR as well. Yeah, sure. I think I covered the larger part of that question with Toni's question about sequential improvement in the traditional server, which is still very CPU-centric. On a combined server, right, now 25% of the total volume is APUs, which obviously GPU is the biggest portion of it. So we expect that sequential improvement driven by recovery in demand in units and then obviously, the shift to Gen11, which is important in this transition. On the GPU lead times, they have come down but it's still elevated. We're talking about 20-plus weeks at least lead time. And so -- and then it's going to be a combination of multiple type of GPUs, right, because there is still demand for the prior generation to H100. Obviously, the majority of the demand today is on H100. And going forward, we're going to have the Grace Hopper H200 and others, right, including MI 300x and the like. And the difference for us is that because we have a unique network in interconnect fabric, we can support all of them. So that's an important differentiation that I think everyone needs to remind because while a lot of the volume today is NVIDIA and then on the supercomputing, which is also an AI business, by the way, we support all three of them. And so that, for us, gives us the optionality to convert the orders that we have and future orders we see in the pipeline with a little bit more flexibility, I will say. Yeah, Wamsi. I can start and Marie, feel free to add. I mean, the fact of the matter is that when you look at that $4 billion cumulative orders, a significant portion is going to go through the HPE GreenLake. If you recall last year, I announced that a hyperscaler placed an order with us, and that order is going through the GreenLake platform. And so that's why you see a breakdown over time of the AI GPU orders going through the ARR, which is fine. Ultimately, they give us the ability to attach other services, which is important to remember here, because remember, when it goes to the HPE GreenLake, in many cases, we are actually running those systems for the customer.  It's not just shipping the system to the customer. We actually put it in a location, whereas our data center footprint with our cooling and power, and then we attach our services, which are the run time plus other things we do. And why it's important also the growth in ARR because that drives margin expansion and accretion over time. So that's what's going on in addition to the fact that, obviously, now we crossed 31,000 customers on HPE GreenLake platform.  To put it in context, Wamsi, that's almost 3,000 customers in one quarter. I mean, 8% up quarter-over-quarter, 3,000 customers. And everything we do from the software perspective, it now is a subscription whether you sell HPE ProLiant Gen11, let's say, an AI-optimized server, the software to connect the server actually runs to GreenLake. Obviously, software runs through the GreenLake. A lot of the Aruba software, including Aruba Central, a subscription and now you have AI as well. Yeah. No, thank you. That's an excellent question. Obviously, I spoke about the AI life cycle, training, tuning, and inferencing. Obviously, the training side has been more focused on the hyperscalers, so Tier 2, Tier 3 type of providers or companies that are funded well to build these large language models.  But when you look at enterprise, most of the enterprises are going to take a model and fine-tune it to give a context to the model with their data. And that, it can happen in multiple locations, right? It can happen in the data centers or potentially in a Coles or in some cases in the public cloud, but we see more focus on where they can control the data in a secure environment. And then the inferencing side, it can happen in a data center or in a public cloud once they are all trained but also at the edge. In fact, we showcase a lot of the inferencing cases at the edge in Mobile Congress at the edge of the network. Think about use cases like the Coles Supermarket, right? So there is a lot of data to the video footage captured in the stores. That video footage needs to be inferenced right there at that given moment with 0 latency in order to deliver the outcome. And there are in manufacturing and the like. And in fact, one of the use cases we saw also for inferencing is a large bank that now are doing some fine-tuning and inferencing to do risk management and other things. So we -- I will say we are kind of getting into it. I will say the growth will happen in the second half in '25. Definitely, the lead times will play a role. But I'm very encouraged about the momentum we see and the opportunity we have also with the combination of Juniper because most of these inferencing requires the network connectivity to deliver it. And that to me is one of the reasons why we went ahead with that acquisition. Sure, I can start. I will say, listen, I think if you look at our server segment that we just published, we delivered very strong performance. I mean, we are in the target range we committed well back of 11% to 13%. And that -- the fact that we're bringing together give us the flexibility, opportunity to maximize the blended margin here as we go forward. To give a reference, when you sell an EX system, generally it's a liquid cool system that tends to gravitate to the supercomputing side or large AI clusters of thousands of GPUs. But an EX system supports today up to 80,000 GPUs in one system, and that's because of our interconnect fabric HPE Slingshot. In fact, some of those systems have 80,000 GPUs and maybe 40,000 CPUs in one system. But then you have other customers are many 2,000 or 4,000 GPUs. And depending on which location they pick, they need liquid cooling, we deploy those.  Now generally speaking, the XD platform, the Cray XD platform is the one that has the density and is more oriented and ability to mix much different configurations, and that's where the vast majority of the action is today in AI. And ProLiant Gen11 actually is more used for inferencing or in some areas of fine-tuning as well.  So we have the flexibility to meet all those demands with our unique IP. And on top of that, we actually lay our machine learning development environment. In fact, there are customers that come to us just for the MLDE environment. Later on, we pull the server. Now on AUPs, I will you that when you sell an XD, the can be 20 times the value of a traditional server with CPUs. And in EX, it can be up to 35 times. And so as we go forward, the ability to optimize margin through the configs and attach the services, whether it's our data center services plus the software and the Operational Services allows us to really drive the best outcome for our shareholders. Well, thank you for the question. I think we need to understand there are two worlds that will coexist. There is the cloud-native world. Think about the cloud-native world where you have thousands and thousands of applications running on thousands and thousands of servers and they share everything. That architecture will exist for a long, long time because it's cost efficient. And the realization is that those applications world were designed for that type of environment, for the traditional monolithic approach to more a cloud-centric approach. And then you have these AI applications where you may have one application, only one, running on thousands and thousands of servers, which have accelerated compute. And it's a little bit far-fetched to say everything is going to move there. I argue that you will have inferencing solutions that a CPU will be just fine. Think about your phone, right? The phone will have, at some point, the ability to manage a large language model, let's say, 20 billion or 30 billion parameters, or the PC, maybe in the 80 billion to 100 billion parameters.  But when you go up higher than that, obviously, you need potentially a server at the edge. And what I'll call 8-way GPU will be the right way to go.  So I argue there will be a mix in the transition here for a long period of time. Not everything will go to a GPU. It also depends how these large language models and all the AI applications get constructed. Now you asked us -- you made another interesting point which I want to make sure the -- all of you remember. We, as a company, have two now public instances of AI, power with renewal energies where we are supporting some of these customers, including a hyperscaler. And going forward, enterprise customers because they don't have the space and the cooling and the understanding how to run the system of scale.  That's a unique differentiation Hewlett Packard Enterprise have in addition to build systems and ship them. And I think that's an opportunity for us because that will drive stickiness to our HPE GreenLake platform, which obviously will drive recurring revenues but better attach software and services down the road. And Juniper will play a huge role in that environment. Well, thank you, Shannon. And thank you, everyone. I know you have been covering multiple calls today. I know it's late on the East Coast, but I will leave you with a few comments. Number one, we have the right strategy and the right team at the right time. This quarter, obviously, it was a little bit mixed because of the revenue. But remember, a lot of revenue also went through the ARR so we need to understand that implication going forward. I'm very confident about the future. And the moves we have made and continue to make, including the Juniper acquisition, will allow us to participate in this inflection point with a unique IP. Everybody, obviously, is focused about this AI momentum and the server side, but you need more than servers. AI will drive the need for more ports. That means you need more networking bandwidth. That's for sure. Also, let's not forget, we need to do this responsibly. One of the things I'm really proud about our company is the commitment to social responsibility. Doing all of this, addressing the sustainability and the ethical challenges and the responsibility around AI. But listen, just we came out two weeks ago where HP was ranked number one in the Just Capital, ranking something that when you are proud of it and I know shareholder value, all of that. We have to take some actions here. We are really focused on the strong execution and discipline, something we have shown now for six years plus. And that's why I'm confident in the adjusted guidance we provided with Marie. And as we get into \u201825, obviously with the pending acquisition, I feel HPE will be even in a stronger position as we get through 2024. So thank you for your time and hope to connect with you soon."
