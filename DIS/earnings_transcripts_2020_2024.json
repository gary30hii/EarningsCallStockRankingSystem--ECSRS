At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nLowell Singer: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago, and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a transcript of this call will be available on our website. We realize many of you are joining us today from your homes and we are also hosting today's call remotely. So joining me from their homes are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will of course be happy to take some questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. As we close out the fourth quarter and reflect back on the year, I think we'd all agree it\u2019s been a year unlike any other in our lifetimes, and certainly in the history of The Walt Disney Company. Despite the many challenges and hardships, I\u2019m proud to say we have been steadfast in effectively managing our businesses under enormously difficult circumstances. We haven\u2019t just persevered during these tough times. We've also taken a number of deliberate steps and smart risks that have positioned our Company for greater long-term growth. And the impressive resilience Disney has demonstrated, while looking past today's challenges to set the stage for an even brighter future is direct reflection of our outstanding team. They've done and continue to do an admirable job, balancing the needs of our cast, our shareholders and our guests. Of course, the real bright spot amidst the pandemic has been our direct-to-consumer business. One year ago today, we launched Disney+, and it has quickly exceeded our highest expectations. We have since rolled out the services in more than 20 countries worldwide. And on Tuesday, we will launch in Latin America, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina followed by more overseas markets in the coming year. The response from consumers has been overwhelmingly positive. Everywhere that we\u2019ve launched Disney+, audiences have embraced the wide array of high quality entertainment both original and library content. And I\u2019m pleased to report that as of the end of the fourth quarter, Disney+ had more than 73 million paid subscribers, far surpassing our expectations in just its first year, and we\u2019re continuing to see positive trends. During our Investor Day presentation on December 10, we will provide an update of our global subscriber numbers. The growth of Disney+ speaks volumes about the strength of our IP, our unparalleled brands and franchises and our amazing content creators, all part of the Disney difference that sets us apart from everyone else. And when you look across our full suite of streaming service, we have exceeded 120 million paid subscriptions worldwide with impressive subscriber gains for ESPN+ and Hulu, including the rapidly growing Hulu +Live TV. We expect the international launch of our Star-branded general entertainment offering will enable us to grow our business even further in the years ahead. Given that our DTC business is key to the future growth of our company, we've restructured our media and entertainment businesses. By separating content creation from distribution, we've been able to streamline our processes and better align the organization, towards these important strategic objectives, as we accelerate our pivot to a DTC-first business model. We intend to build upon the success we've achieved thus far. And look forward to sharing more of our plans with you, at our upcoming Investor Day. While the pandemic continues to impact our company, resulting in an adjusted loss of $0.20 a share in the fourth quarter, the prolonged situation has prompted us to find new and innovative ways to deal with the difficult and often unpredictable challenges we're facing. We successfully made adjustments and have resumed many of our operations, clearly demonstrating the resiliency The Walt Disney Company is known for. While many of our productions were shut down beginning in March due to COVID, our animation teams were able to work remotely and have continued production uninterrupted during the pandemic. We were also fortunate to keep other parts of our creative pipeline active, and to continue post-production work for our Media Networks studios and Disney+. We've been able to develop processes and institute health and safety measures that have made it possible to resume live-action production as well. Of course, the unpredictability of COVID may result in unforeseen impacts to current and future productions. On the studio side, we have restarted or completed production, on all of the projects previously impacted by COVID, including ones from our Marvel Studios, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, Disney Live-Action and Lucasfilm. And we anticipate having eight new projects up and running, by January. On TV side, we now have more than 100 live-action, scripted and unscripted projects in active production with dozens more in various stages of pre or post production. Across all platforms, there has been a great response to our content. A couple of weeks ago, we rolled out the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian to rave reviews and incredible social buzz. There's been much excitement surrounding the announcement that Disney Pixar's Soul will be debuting on Disney+ on Christmas Day. And on the broadcasting side, ABC is now ranked number one, delivering some of the most popular and most watched shows on television, including Dancing with the Stars and The Conners. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge our incredible, local and national ABC News teams for the outstanding work they continue to do, under very difficult circumstances.  They've been working around the clock, making sure viewers nationwide have access to the most important and accurate information, particularly as it pertains to the COVID pandemic. And they've also done an outstanding job reporting on the election, in an informative and balanced way. From Good Morning America holding its spot as the number one morning news cast, for the eighth straight year to World News Tonight with David Muir, consistently ranking as the number one evening newscast as well as the number one program on all broadcast and cable television in the U.S. over the summer, there is no question ABC News is America's number one news source. On the park side, we've proven over many months that we're able to operate our parks responsibly, following strictly enforced guidelines provided by health care experts, successfully reopening our parks in Orlando, Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong. We've also reopened Disneyland Paris for several months, although the resort is now temporarily closed due to President Macron's recent lockdown order in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in Europe. People have shown a willingness to visit our parks, which I believe is a testament to the fact that they feel confident in the measures we've taken. And we are very encouraged by the positive news earlier this week on the progress of potential vaccines. Unfortunately, we are extremely disappointed that the State of California continues to keep Disneyland closed despite our proven track record. Our health and safety protocols are all science-based and have the support of labor unions representing 99% of our hourly cast members. Frankly as we and other civic leaders have stated before, we believe state leadership should look objectively at what we've achieved successfully at our parks around the world all based on science as opposed to setting an arbitrary standard that is precluding our cast members from getting back to work while decimating small businesses in the local community. Our ability to operate responsibly in this pandemic environment extends beyond our theme parks. I'm proud to say that we were successfully able to host the NBA and MLS at Walt Disney World in Orlando. It's been a huge undertaking and a great achievement. Just consider the NBA for example: 94 days, 22 teams, 172 games, players, broadcast partners, referees, media, support staff and Disney employees all in the bubble. It was also a big win for ESPN, which broadcast the games along with a packed schedule of other sports offerings including the WNBA, college football, Major League Baseball and the NFL. As you look at the most watched cable shows on TV this year more than half have been live sports proving that sports are a powerful draw despite the disruption of the pandemic. ESPN Digital and ESPN+ have also performed exceptionally well with September being the best month ever for ESPN streaming video. ESPN+ continues its positive subscriber growth reaching more than 10 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter, nearly tripling in size over the past year. As you can see, even during these most uncertain times, here's The Walt Disney Company. We are finding ways to not only operate our businesses effectively, but also take the necessary bold steps for our future growth. And we are more committed than ever to investing in our businesses in particular our DTC strategy, which we see as the key driver of significant long-term value for our company. We look forward to sharing details of our plans with you at our Investor Day next month. We also can't wait for you to see the extraordinary content that's being created for our full portfolio of streaming services: Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Star. It's just fantastic. And with that I'll turn it over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability the fiscal fourth quarter's diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.20 and our full year fiscal 2020 diluted EPS was $2.02. Our financial results continued to reflect significant impacts from COVID-19 which we estimate adversely impacted segment operating income in Q4 by $3.1 billion. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was again the most severely affected with an estimated adverse impact of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We estimate that Media Networks operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $500 million due to COVID largely due to costs at ESPN associated with programming in the fourth quarter that was delayed from prior quarters. Another factor that affected our Q4 results was the 53rd week. While last quarter we guided to the 53rd week having a modest adverse impact on operating results. The additional week of operations actually resulted in a benefit. There were a few reasons behind this variance, but the largest driver was related to the timing of sports rights costs. I'll now turn to our results by segment. At Parks, Experiences and Products financial results in the quarter were significantly impacted by restricted capacity and closures. Operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of $1.1 billion. This reflects the closures of Disneyland Resort in California and our cruise line business for the entirety of the quarter. Shanghai Disney Resort was open for the full quarter after reopening in May, while Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris reopened in mid-July. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for a couple of weeks at the beginning and end of the quarter. All of our reopened parks and resorts were operating at significantly reduced capacities during Q4. However, we are pleased to report that Walt Disney World, Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland all achieved a net positive contribution in the quarter which means, we generated revenue that exceeded the variable costs associated with reopening. At Walt Disney World we are also encouraged by the booking trends we are seeing. Park reservations at our reduced capacity limits are already 77% booked for Q1 with Thanksgiving week booked close to capacity. These trends provide us with further confidence around underlying consumer demand for our parks and experiences. At Studio Entertainment operating income decreased in the quarter due to lower theatrical distribution and home entertainment results. Worldwide theatrical results continued to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 as theaters were closed in many key markets both domestically and internationally. With no significant worldwide theatrical releases in the quarter, we faced a difficult comparison against the strong performance of the Lion King and Toy Story 4 in the prior year quarter. The decrease was partially offset by lower marketing expenses. Lower home entertainment results were driven by lower unit sales, also partially offset by lower marketing expenses. Unit sales were lower in the quarter as there were no comparable releases versus the prior year performance of Avengers: Endgame, Aladdin and Captain Marvel. Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the fourth quarter due to higher results at broadcasting, partially offset by lower results at cable networks. At broadcasting, the increase in operating income was primarily due to affiliate revenue growth and lower programming production and marketing costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely driven by COVID-19-related production shutdowns and cancellations of network programming, the shift of college football games to fiscal 2021 and a delay in airing new season premieres. Lower results at Cable Networks were driven by decreases at ESPN, partially offset by increases at FX networks and the domestic Disney channels. ESPN results were lower as affiliate and advertising revenue growth were more than offset by higher programming and production costs. At ESPN, higher programming and production costs were largely due to COVID-related shifts of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball into the fourth quarter. This included two NBA finals games and 16 MLB postseason games that fell into the 53rd week. Total ESPN advertising revenue was up 26% in the fourth quarter including the benefit of the 53rd week. The return of live sports events drove higher rates slightly offset by viewership declines. So far this quarter, ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing below the prior year, primarily due to shifts in college football schedules, particularly for the Big Ten and the Pac-12. Given the timing of programming remaining in the quarter, we currently expect that ESPN advertising revenue will end the first quarter higher versus the prior year. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 12% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of eight points from the 53rd week and eight points of growth from higher rates offset by a four-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. The decrease in subscribers benefited by about two points from the launch of the ACC Network. At Direct-to-Consumer & International, an operating loss of $580 million in the quarter was an improvement of approximately $170 million compared to the prior year. This improvement was driven by higher results at Hulu and ESPN+, partially offset by costs associated with the ongoing rollout of Disney+ and a decrease at our international channels. At Hulu, the improvement was primarily due to both subscriber and advertising revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. The improvement at ESPN+ was due to subscriber growth as well as increased pay-per-view income from UFC events. Hulu ended the fourth quarter with 36.6 million paid subscribers and ESPN+ ended the quarter with 10.3 million paid subscribers. Disney+ ended Q4 with 73.7 million paid subscribers or an increase of over 16 million subscribers versus Q3. Disney+ Hotstar subscriber additions were the largest contributor to this increase, driven by the start of the delayed IPL season. Disney+ Hotstar subscribers now account for a little over a quarter of our global subscriber base. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.52. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.30. On our last earnings call, we said that we expected the fourth quarter operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior year quarter. Our results came in better than that guidance, with operating income at our DTC businesses improving by approximately $300 million versus the prior year due to better than expected performance across all three of our streaming services. I will note that we do not plan to further update any of our subscriber numbers until our Investor Day on December 10. At our international channels, lower results were due to lower affiliate and advertising revenues, partially offset by a decrease in costs. Switching gears, I want to take a moment to give you an update on our 21CF acquisition. We previously stated our expectation that the deal would be accretive to EPS, excluding the impact of purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. While COVID certainly had an impact on these numbers, we estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu were accretive in both Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2020, excluding the impact of purchase accounting. As a practical matter, given our recent reorganization and the successful and complete integration of these assets into The Walt Disney Company, it is no longer practical nor do we believe it would be insightful into our businesses to break down 21CF performance. Therefore, we do not intend to discuss legacy Fox results or accretion on a go-forward basis. As we've discussed on prior calls, while our liquidity position remains strong, we are continuing to manage our leverage with a long-term commitment to return to levels consistent with a single A credit rating. As part of that commitment and given limited visibility due to COVID and our decision to prioritize investment in our DTC initiatives, the Board has decided to forego payment of a semi-annual dividend in January 2021. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to prioritize investing in the growth of our businesses, particularly in the direct-to-consumer space. However, we anticipate the payment of a dividend will remain a part of our long-term capital allocation strategy following the return to a normalized operating environment. As we look forward, we expect that our results in fiscal 2021 will continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Our visibility is limited and will be influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the recovery of theatrical exhibition, confidence in consumer travel and the continued resumption of live sports. But, as we sit here today, there are a few items we would like to highlight that may help frame expectations for the first quarter. Our Parks and Experiences business continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and we do not have visibility into how long these impacts will last. While some of our parks are open with limited capacity, we currently anticipate Disneyland Resort will remain closed at least through the end of the fiscal first quarter. Disneyland Paris is also currently closed. Because we have no significant tentpole theatrical releases planned for Q1, we expect that our theatrical results will be meaningfully below the prior year, during which we released Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2. We also anticipate that home entertainment, stage play and studio TV SVOD results will be meaningfully lower year-over-year. Similarly at Consumer Products, we expect merchandise licensing results in Q1 to be adversely impacted due to comparisons versus Star Wars and Frozen merchandise in the prior year. At ESPN, first quarter results will be significantly impacted by higher rights and production costs due to the shift of four NBA finals games and three additional college football playoff games into quarter, along with incremental regular season college football rights costs shifting into the quarter. This impact is partially offset by an expected delayed start to the 2020-2021 NBA season. We expect the Q1 operating results of our DTC businesses to decline by approximate $100 million relative to the prior year quarter, driven by continued investment in Disney+, partially offset by improved results at both ESPN+ and Hulu. At our international channels business, we expect first quarter operating results to decline by approximately $300 million versus the prior year quarter driven by a combination of higher sports rights costs due to timing shifts COVID-related impacts and channel closures. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 were approximately $4 billion, down about $850 million from the prior year due to decreased spending at our domestic parks and resorts. We expect CapEx in fiscal year 2021 to be $550 million higher versus fiscal year 2020 due to increased investments at our media and entertainment distribution businesses and at corporate, partially offset by reduced spending at Parks Experiences and Products. As we've previously noted, we will start reporting under our new organizational structure in the first fiscal quarter of 2021. While our reporting segments will change, we intend to provide key financial and supplemental information, including much of what we report today, particularly as it relates to our direct-to-consumer businesses. As always, our goal is to provide the needed transparency into our businesses. We remain very excited about our future and we also look forward to sharing more details on our evolving DTC strategy at our December 10 virtual Investor Day. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks Christine. And as we do transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate this by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that, operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Of course. Our first question will come from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Lowell I have two for you to shepherd. The first is on ESPN. You'd announced some cost cuts, but I wondered, if the company is taking a fresh look at their content rights needs? And if there's any kind of update on the willingness to maybe cut back on some of the rights you've had previously? How do you think about that? And then secondly, for whomever you want to send it to, over the years Disney made a pretty smart decision to cut back the number of films they release every year, to focus on quality and franchises. And I just wonder now with the reorganization and the new game plan at DTC, how will kind of the quality of the franchises and the content output be managed, as it's increased, right? So it looks like it's a change in terms of the output of the organization. Just want to hear about the quality management of that. Thanks Lowell.\nLowell Singer: Okay Michael. Thanks. I'm going to turn both of those over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: All right. Thank you, Lowell. Hi, Michael.\nMichael Nathanson: Hi, Bob.\nBob Chapek: In terms of ESPN and the cost cuts, we are obviously watching our costs across all of our operating units very carefully, in light of the adversity that we're facing with the pandemic. But long-term, as we look at our content rights, well we're looking at it from a shareholder standpoint. If it's accretive to shareholder value, then there are decisions that we make going forward in terms of looking at new rights, as they expire. And what we want to put on to our service. So we're being very deliberate and we're being very careful. And analyzing everything to make sure that it would be something, that would be additive to us. And I might say that, we've got very good relationships with all the leagues. And it's important. We continue to believe in sports. As a matter of fact in 2019, 93 of the top 100 programs in viewership on television were sports. And as you know, we've got the most trusted brand out there in the world, in terms of sports. So we believe that's a nice recipe for future success. But we realize that the world is changing. And there's a lot of dynamics at play. But we'll only do continue rights deals as long as they add shareholder value. In terms of the second question and in terms of the looking at the number of films and the amount of content that we put into the system, you're right. Over time we've been very, very discriminate, in terms of what types of films we make and how many we make. And I think that's really benefited the company. We're in a world though now in a subscription business, where we're managing churn. And we've got a unique combination of assets in this company that are all at play right now in Disney+, where we've not only got the most desirable library in the world, but we realize and that really helps by the way minimize churn. But we also realize that new content that we put add subscribers. It's very clear to us, that new content adds subscribers. So I think you'll see a continued increase in investment, in our direct-to-consumer platforms. And that will then fuel, some of the growth that Christine will talk about at the investor conference, that we expect on December 10.\nLowell Singer: Michael? Thanks for the -- okay. Thanks Michael for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Hi. Thank you. Just a bit of a follow-up question, if I may, on the studio content commentary, I would love any color you could give potentially on, what you learned from the release of Mulan into premium video-on-demand? And really how you think about, at least how you've thought about it in the past, your decision to allocate content on different platforms for example, why Mulan goes to AOP VOD, but Soul is going directly to Disney+ for example so any thoughts there? And then my second -- just a follow-up question is really on the parks. You've made some real improvement in cutting your losses this quarter from the last quarter. I guess is it feasible to assume you can continue to see a further improvement in that segment without Disneyland opening? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Alexia thanks so much. So Bob, I'll turn them both over to you Mulan and Soul and then some of the trends we're seeing at parks. \nBob Chapek: Okay. Great. So from a studio content standpoint, we were very pleased with the results of Mulan as a premier access title. And as you remember that was our very first foray into a strategy like premier access. Unfortunately that title met with some controversy both in the U.S. and internationally shortly after we released it. But we saw enough very positive results before that controversy started to know that we've got something here in terms of the premier access strategy. And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the investor conference in December. In terms of Soul, we also realized though that part of the lifeblood of Disney+ is providing great content to the base level subscribers that are in there in premier or in Disney+. And so the idea is that, we thought it was a really nice gesture to our subscribers to take Soul during the holiday period and provide that as part of the service. But I think what we've learned with Mulan is that there's going to be a role for it strategically with our portfolio of offerings. And again we're going to talk more about that at the investor conference in December. In terms of our opportunities to continue to improve parks, we're actually very encouraged by what we're seeing right now in our parks across the world. There's really two dynamics that are going on. Number one, our park operators which as you know are the best in the world are becoming much more efficient and effective in operating under COVID guidelines. And we've been able to pretty materially increase our capacity and still stay within the guidelines that local governments are giving us for example 6-foot social distancing. And this is happening across our parks across the world. In fact Walt Disney World which was at a 25% capacity constraint which was our industrial engineering estimates to keep 6-foot social distancing now has been able to increase to 35% of capacity. So almost a 50% increase in the number of guests that we can allow in and still adhere to the local guidelines and the guidelines that are stipulated by the CDC with the 6-foot social distancing. So we're very pleased by how we've become adept at operating under these constraints. But the second thing that's even more encouraging is the demanding -- demand that's growing for our parks across the world. I think it says two different things. Number one shows the love that guests have for our experiences that we have within our parks and the tremendous IP that we as a company have. But I also think it speaks to the trust that people have given the track record that we now have after months of operating across the globe with very stringent guidelines. And we're very pleased with our track record. And I think people are now through forward bookings and reservations showing some very encouraging signs about their willingness to come and spend time with us at a Disney park. \nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Alexia, thank you. Operator, next please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, good afternoon. Christine I know you're not going to be providing the accretion dilution analysis going forward and I certainly get a lot of moving pieces. But I'm just wondering, if you could tell us whether there are additional costs that you expect to come out of the business? I think you guys had talked about over $2 billion of synergies. I'm just wondering if we look at 2021 versus '20, if there's still more to go as you work through the integration etcetera? And then probably for Bob. Bob, I know you're saving a lot for December 10, but you announced a pretty substantial reorganization of the company in a year that's obviously already had a lot of disruption, particularly around the Direct-to-Consumer business with Kevin leaving et cetera. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your motivation there kind of the reaction you've gotten from your senior executives. Many have had their roles shifted pretty substantially including giving up kind of P&L accountability. Just wonder if you could talk about your confidence that you -- you're going to get what you want out of this from a company perspective and that you can manage the risk of separating content production decisions from monetization decisions because it's a pretty substantial change? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay, Hi, Ben.\nBen Swinburne: Hello.\nChristine McCarthy: It's Christine. Let me take your first question which was on the cost savings that we achieved from the integration of 21CF. And we did meet -- actually we exceeded that $2 billion number. And so we feel really good about the momentum we have on the efficiency side. And we're also going to take the opportunity to continue looking for operational efficiencies. The one thing we've learned in this COVID environment is there are ways of being more efficient and we'll continue to mine those. And it actually has really helped us not only in segments like our parks business that are directly impacted, but throughout the entire company. So we'll continue to drive towards greater efficiencies. And when the -- you asked about how much do we incur in the restructuring charges related to Fox. Overall, Fox restructuring charges were $1.7 billion. And $1.2 billion of that was incurred in fiscal 2019 so $500 million was done this year. And in this quarter where we had about a little under $400 million of restructuring charges a portion of that was also Fox related. It comes out to about a little over -- a little less than 30%. So the balance was related to our cuts at \u2013 reductions-in-force at Parks. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Got it. \nBob Chapek: And in terms of the question on the reorganization, I would suggest that maybe given everything that's happening in the world this is the perfect time for us to do such a reorganization. And I'm 100% confident that this is going to play out exactly as we had intended. It's going extremely well. And despite the disruption in everyone's roles, I think we have 100% buy in. I think we have 100% buy in because we have clarity on accountability which everyone really likes. And we separate out roles to what people tend to do best. Content does what they do best and same with distribution. So distribution who manages the P&L will set the parameters for our annual and long-term budget framework that's been agreed to on the slate with the content creators. And then the content creators then green light the individual projects that then shepherd development and production. So essentially distribution is now able to optimize the commercialization without maybe too much unnecessary regard for legacy distribution platforms, but at the same time our creatives who as you know are the best in the world are really free to do what they do. And that's just make the best content and storytelling possible. A lot of collaboration between the two groups, but ultimately some level of independence in terms of each being what they can be and doing their jobs best. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Ben, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Lowell, thank you. I have two questions as well. Could you comment on the change of management at Star? Does that affect your strategy in India or outside with the rollout of the Star-branded service? And then secondly, sorry to be negative, but the sports viewing decline -- I mean there's just so much going on and I wonder if you could give us your thoughts like there were no fans in the stadium so would change the viewing experience. The calendar has changed. There's a lot of sports in a short period of time. Do you have any concerns about how this will impact consumer behavior post-COVID? I'd love your thoughts on kind of the longer-term outlook for sports?\nLowell Singer: Okay, Jessica. Thanks. I am going to turn both of those questions over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: Okay. I'm going to take the last one first. In terms of sports ratings, sports ratings we feel that in context of everything that's happening are actually holding up quite well. But we would be careful not to draw any conclusions about the ultimate health of sports sort of the long-term impact that you suggested during this pandemic. We really think that we're sort of looking at apples and oranges here. I think the best comp we probably have is the NFL, which has been relatively flat. Our Monday night football viewership has been down 4% relatively modest despite all the headwinds. I mean, we've got the risk of seasons not finishing. To your point, we don't have fans in the stands. We have the risk of games individually every week being canceled. We have election news as competition. And we really can't have our fans doing what they like to do the best which is watch in a communal setting. They pretty much are watching by themselves. Despite all those headwinds, the fact that our Monday night football business is relatively flat in terms of viewership is really I think really encouraging. And if you adjust if you will viewership over the last couple of months for the amount of available content, you see that they kind of slide together. So we actually don't have any concerns about the long-term health of sports. Obviously, we've got some headwinds as it pertains to short-term challenges and hurdles. But we think that all in all in context, the health of sports is pretty decent given everything that's going on. In terms of India, obviously we have an executive there Uday Shankar who we love and we wish him well. He gave us some indication several months ago that he was thinking of moving on. We've got a really deep bench there. And we feel that we have all kinds of opportunities and a lot of success so far with Disney+. And we have no reason to believe that that success won't continue and even accelerate going forward.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Jessica, thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Lowell, I got two quick ones and then a main question. The quick ones are the math on India, I think if I have it right based on Christine's comment around $5.30 you're around 11 million subs, which would be about 2.5 million added in the quarter. I just wanted to make sure that was in the ballpark and I was looking for an update on the cruise ships that were on order. But the main question is having re-upped some Disney+ distribution deals, what changes are you seeing now, now that you are of the uncertain phase and the value on both sides is better defined for you and for the distributor, does the economics of those deals change? Or should we think about the cost of that marketing channel as locked in? And I also ask because as you add more and more original content to your streaming services I would think the benefit starts to shift in favor the distributors as you add more and more value to those services. So that would be helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay. So I'll let Christine sort of quickly address your India question and then I'll turn over the cruise and the Disney+ questions to Bob.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Hi, Doug, we're not \u2013 the comments that I gave on the Hotstar Disney+ India subs, we just don't comment on those economics. So unfortunately, we can't give you any more detail on that.\nBob Chapek: And in terms of cruise ships, as you know, we just got new guidelines from the CDC that are quite thorough let's say. And they really entail some really high hurdles in terms of not only testing by the potential guests that we host on the ships, but also a process that has to happen in order to certify our first sailings. Those will necessarily result in delays beyond what we had hoped in terms of getting our ships back in service and making magic for our guests. I guess, the best news out of all of it is that, we now do see some light at the end of the tunnel. I think we have an opportunity to create sort of a Disney bubble, if you want \u2013 if you would on each one of our cruise ships. And demand is very, very strong for our cruise ships. We're seeing extremely strong demand in the back half of FY 2021, and all of 2022 in terms of \u2013 of bookings. That said, that then creates the demand for the new ships that you asked about. And right now we're anticipating delivering our first new ship The Wish in summer of 2022. And then we have our next two ships in 2024 and 2025. And so after a slight delay of roughly six months on those ships, we think that we're going to be able to bring them on to service. We hope and expect that the world will back to normal by then, and anticipate having a fine time trying to fill up the demand of those ships. And we think there's going to be so much pent-up demand that, we don't expect to have much issues given the love that our guests have for Disney Cruise Lines. In terms of the distribution deals and sort of the changing the landscape over time with those, we're really pleased with our partnerships to date. We try to limit them. We don't do too many, but we use them to strategically pursue growth of our subscriber base and lower subscriber acquisition costs. So as you know, we have one or two of these in each market. That's about it. But it really does help us sort of provide a base during our growth phase, and we've got full flexibility over time to either ramp those up, or ramp those down as we see fit.\nDoug Mitchelson: Great. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks Doug. Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Bazinet: Just a question for Mr. Chapek. Can I go back to the re-org that you announced? The more content it seems that you put on the DTC side, the lower your earnings will be but the better the sub growth will be and the higher the stock price will be. And so as those decisions are being made today and next year and the year after, are there guardrails in place that sort of mean, this will be a gradual transition? Or is it really whatever the right business decision, is the right business decision, and you'll do it, even if it means, maybe different near-term financials in terms of profitability than The Street is expecting? Thank you.\nBob Chapek: Yeah. I think the guardrails are good common sense as it pertains to managing cash. With our parks business sort of being \u2013 having an anchor on it, if you will that we can't properly operate our parks business like we'd like to we have to be a little bit more careful today than we might have to be in the future. But I'm just going to suggest that when we talk to everybody on December 10, I think you're going to see that we're going to put a lot of wind in the sails of our Disney+ business and heavily invest in it. And so the guardrails are just the only ones that would be the constraints that we face today in terms of cash. Other than that everything is really full speed forward. And of course we've got our linear networks that we're managing. We've made some reductions just this last week at ESPN as we manage the transition from linear to more of a digital experience and direct-to-consumer experience. And so as we toggle that balance between sort of the legacy old media businesses to the new media businesses, we'll do it aggressively, but we will watch it from a cash standpoint in the meantime.\nJason Bazinet: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer : Jason, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey, thanks. Maybe just a quick couple of few follow-up to Jason's questions. Bob in terms of the cash you got $18 billion on the books. I guess, can we expect a significant, like you said a significant ramp in the content spend? And can we assume as a result of that that the progress you guys have made in terms of DTC losses, doesn't mean that those losses have peaked at this point? And then can you talk a little bit about content spend as it relates to entertainment program going into Disney+ and Hulu and Star and ESPN+? ESPN+ obviously has been a -- there's some nice growth there getting up to 10 million subs. Do you expect to shift more of your portfolio from or simulcasted from linear to the DTC platform? Or should we expect some investments in new rights? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. John, thanks for the question. I'm going to let Christine take the first question around cash and then Bob talk a little bit more about program investment.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, John. It's Christine. You're right that our cash and cash equivalents are a very healthy $18 billion. That's down from $23 billion in the prior quarter. Just to put some context around the reduction we lowered our commercial paper balances by almost $5 billion. And we also had some bond maturities over $1 billion that we took care of. But we are still generating operating cash and we are investing in our content now. We're spending a lot of our productions are back up and running. So we're going to manage this. But as we ramp up even more additional new productions we will be spending more cash on that, but we'll follow this up. And when the peak of investment is anticipated we will update you with that information on December 10. \nBob Chapek: And my answers are going to be relatively the same in terms of the programming between our linear and our DTC business. First of all, Christine will talk about sort of the guidance at the investor conference specifically in terms of we have our losses peaked, which was your direct question and will update though. Additionally, we will be investing heavily. We'll talk again about -- more about this at the investor conference, but we are going to continue to ramp up our investment in DTC. And we will be heavily tilting the scale from linear networks over to our DTC business, as we see that as we said in our opening comments our primary catalyst for growth as a company. So, again, we're going to talk a lot more about this on December 10, but you will see a heavy tilt.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: John, thanks for the question. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And our final question today will come from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good afternoon. Two for me. First, can you talk about the ad revenue per Hulu subscriber decline in the quarter that you referenced in the release? Just given the strength that we're seeing in the sort of connected TV marketplace, I was kind of surprised to see that. So I'm curious your take on how that business is going, and how we should think about that. My second question is really a follow-up to one of the early ones around sports and sports content. And I'm curious how you think about expanding sports content availability to consumers that don't have a pay TV package. I think at this point there's 30 million or 35 million households in the U.S. Bob, you just referenced some of the stability in ratings. So maybe that would imply that people who want sports still pay TV, and so it's not an issue. But I'm curious, if the leagues have any increasing urgency to sort of reach those, those cord cutters or cord nevers and maybe what some of the considerations are for you whether it's financial impact or whether it's rights limitations or things like that? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Okay, Mike. So I'm going to let Bob take the sports question, and then we'll go to Christine on the Hulu question.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the -- sort of the cord cutters and solutions for the cord cutters, I won't speak to what the leagues' thoughts are. I'll leave that up to them. But I will tell you that we've got a product that we're really excited about and has experienced some rapid growth and that's Hulu + Live TV. And it really gives the utility that consumers might normally find from the cable or satellite subscriber and be able to get it over-the-top directly to their homes. And I think this will increasingly act as a solution to those households that have walked away from their traditional, more traditional cable type of subscriptions and potentially slide it + Live TV. And that's one of the reasons why we're really bullish about that business. I'm a personal big fan of it. I use it. And it's really slick. It's very elegant, and it really is a big solution provider. It's really the complete solution, I think. So we're excited about that in terms of solving a consumer need for those consumers as you mentioned that have all walked away from that particular way of distributing and receiving content.\nChristine McCarthy: Mike and on Hulu, overall, I would say that we're seeing very, very strong demand for advertising on Hulu in the addressable market. But the year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted on a per sub basis by what we're seeing in the advertising market overall in Q3 and Q4. But we're going to talk more about Hulu advertising in more detail at the Investor Day. So, just hold on until December 10, and hopefully we can answer all your questions then.\nMichael Morris: Great, thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Mike. Thank you, and thanks again everyone for joining us today. As Bob and Christine have mentioned we are looking forward to sharing a lot more with you at our December 10 Investor Day, and we look forward to seeing a lot of you then.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability the fiscal fourth quarter's diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.20 and our full year fiscal 2020 diluted EPS was $2.02. Our financial results continued to reflect significant impacts from COVID-19 which we estimate adversely impacted segment operating income in Q4 by $3.1 billion. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was again the most severely affected with an estimated adverse impact of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We estimate that Media Networks operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $500 million due to COVID largely due to costs at ESPN associated with programming in the fourth quarter that was delayed from prior quarters. Another factor that affected our Q4 results was the 53rd week. While last quarter we guided to the 53rd week having a modest adverse impact on operating results. The additional week of operations actually resulted in a benefit. There were a few reasons behind this variance, but the largest driver was related to the timing of sports rights costs. I'll now turn to our results by segment. At Parks, Experiences and Products financial results in the quarter were significantly impacted by restricted capacity and closures. Operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of $1.1 billion. This reflects the closures of Disneyland Resort in California and our cruise line business for the entirety of the quarter. Shanghai Disney Resort was open for the full quarter after reopening in May, while Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris reopened in mid-July. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for a couple of weeks at the beginning and end of the quarter. All of our reopened parks and resorts were operating at significantly reduced capacities during Q4. However, we are pleased to report that Walt Disney World, Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland all achieved a net positive contribution in the quarter which means, we generated revenue that exceeded the variable costs associated with reopening. At Walt Disney World we are also encouraged by the booking trends we are seeing. Park reservations at our reduced capacity limits are already 77% booked for Q1 with Thanksgiving week booked close to capacity. These trends provide us with further confidence around underlying consumer demand for our parks and experiences. At Studio Entertainment operating income decreased in the quarter due to lower theatrical distribution and home entertainment results. Worldwide theatrical results continued to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 as theaters were closed in many key markets both domestically and internationally. With no significant worldwide theatrical releases in the quarter, we faced a difficult comparison against the strong performance of the Lion King and Toy Story 4 in the prior year quarter. The decrease was partially offset by lower marketing expenses. Lower home entertainment results were driven by lower unit sales, also partially offset by lower marketing expenses. Unit sales were lower in the quarter as there were no comparable releases versus the prior year performance of Avengers: Endgame, Aladdin and Captain Marvel. Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the fourth quarter due to higher results at broadcasting, partially offset by lower results at cable networks. At broadcasting, the increase in operating income was primarily due to affiliate revenue growth and lower programming production and marketing costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely driven by COVID-19-related production shutdowns and cancellations of network programming, the shift of college football games to fiscal 2021 and a delay in airing new season premieres. Lower results at Cable Networks were driven by decreases at ESPN, partially offset by increases at FX networks and the domestic Disney channels. ESPN results were lower as affiliate and advertising revenue growth were more than offset by higher programming and production costs. At ESPN, higher programming and production costs were largely due to COVID-related shifts of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball into the fourth quarter. This included two NBA finals games and 16 MLB postseason games that fell into the 53rd week. Total ESPN advertising revenue was up 26% in the fourth quarter including the benefit of the 53rd week. The return of live sports events drove higher rates slightly offset by viewership declines. So far this quarter, ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing below the prior year, primarily due to shifts in college football schedules, particularly for the Big Ten and the Pac-12. Given the timing of programming remaining in the quarter, we currently expect that ESPN advertising revenue will end the first quarter higher versus the prior year. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 12% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of eight points from the 53rd week and eight points of growth from higher rates offset by a four-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. The decrease in subscribers benefited by about two points from the launch of the ACC Network. At Direct-to-Consumer & International, an operating loss of $580 million in the quarter was an improvement of approximately $170 million compared to the prior year. This improvement was driven by higher results at Hulu and ESPN+, partially offset by costs associated with the ongoing rollout of Disney+ and a decrease at our international channels. At Hulu, the improvement was primarily due to both subscriber and advertising revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. The improvement at ESPN+ was due to subscriber growth as well as increased pay-per-view income from UFC events. Hulu ended the fourth quarter with 36.6 million paid subscribers and ESPN+ ended the quarter with 10.3 million paid subscribers. Disney+ ended Q4 with 73.7 million paid subscribers or an increase of over 16 million subscribers versus Q3. Disney+ Hotstar subscriber additions were the largest contributor to this increase, driven by the start of the delayed IPL season. Disney+ Hotstar subscribers now account for a little over a quarter of our global subscriber base. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.52. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.30. On our last earnings call, we said that we expected the fourth quarter operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior year quarter. Our results came in better than that guidance, with operating income at our DTC businesses improving by approximately $300 million versus the prior year due to better than expected performance across all three of our streaming services. I will note that we do not plan to further update any of our subscriber numbers until our Investor Day on December 10. At our international channels, lower results were due to lower affiliate and advertising revenues, partially offset by a decrease in costs. Switching gears, I want to take a moment to give you an update on our 21CF acquisition. We previously stated our expectation that the deal would be accretive to EPS, excluding the impact of purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. While COVID certainly had an impact on these numbers, we estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu were accretive in both Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2020, excluding the impact of purchase accounting. As a practical matter, given our recent reorganization and the successful and complete integration of these assets into The Walt Disney Company, it is no longer practical nor do we believe it would be insightful into our businesses to break down 21CF performance. Therefore, we do not intend to discuss legacy Fox results or accretion on a go-forward basis. As we've discussed on prior calls, while our liquidity position remains strong, we are continuing to manage our leverage with a long-term commitment to return to levels consistent with a single A credit rating. As part of that commitment and given limited visibility due to COVID and our decision to prioritize investment in our DTC initiatives, the Board has decided to forego payment of a semi-annual dividend in January 2021. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to prioritize investing in the growth of our businesses, particularly in the direct-to-consumer space. However, we anticipate the payment of a dividend will remain a part of our long-term capital allocation strategy following the return to a normalized operating environment. As we look forward, we expect that our results in fiscal 2021 will continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Our visibility is limited and will be influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the recovery of theatrical exhibition, confidence in consumer travel and the continued resumption of live sports. But, as we sit here today, there are a few items we would like to highlight that may help frame expectations for the first quarter. Our Parks and Experiences business continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and we do not have visibility into how long these impacts will last. While some of our parks are open with limited capacity, we currently anticipate Disneyland Resort will remain closed at least through the end of the fiscal first quarter. Disneyland Paris is also currently closed. Because we have no significant tentpole theatrical releases planned for Q1, we expect that our theatrical results will be meaningfully below the prior year, during which we released Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2. We also anticipate that home entertainment, stage play and studio TV SVOD results will be meaningfully lower year-over-year. Similarly at Consumer Products, we expect merchandise licensing results in Q1 to be adversely impacted due to comparisons versus Star Wars and Frozen merchandise in the prior year. At ESPN, first quarter results will be significantly impacted by higher rights and production costs due to the shift of four NBA finals games and three additional college football playoff games into quarter, along with incremental regular season college football rights costs shifting into the quarter. This impact is partially offset by an expected delayed start to the 2020-2021 NBA season. We expect the Q1 operating results of our DTC businesses to decline by approximate $100 million relative to the prior year quarter, driven by continued investment in Disney+, partially offset by improved results at both ESPN+ and Hulu. At our international channels business, we expect first quarter operating results to decline by approximately $300 million versus the prior year quarter driven by a combination of higher sports rights costs due to timing shifts COVID-related impacts and channel closures. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 were approximately $4 billion, down about $850 million from the prior year due to decreased spending at our domestic parks and resorts. We expect CapEx in fiscal year 2021 to be $550 million higher versus fiscal year 2020 due to increased investments at our media and entertainment distribution businesses and at corporate, partially offset by reduced spending at Parks Experiences and Products. As we've previously noted, we will start reporting under our new organizational structure in the first fiscal quarter of 2021. While our reporting segments will change, we intend to provide key financial and supplemental information, including much of what we report today, particularly as it relates to our direct-to-consumer businesses. As always, our goal is to provide the needed transparency into our businesses. We remain very excited about our future and we also look forward to sharing more details on our evolving DTC strategy at our December 10 virtual Investor Day. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions. Okay, Hi, Ben. It's Christine. Let me take your first question which was on the cost savings that we achieved from the integration of 21CF. And we did meet -- actually we exceeded that $2 billion number. And so we feel really good about the momentum we have on the efficiency side. And we're also going to take the opportunity to continue looking for operational efficiencies. The one thing we've learned in this COVID environment is there are ways of being more efficient and we'll continue to mine those. And it actually has really helped us not only in segments like our parks business that are directly impacted, but throughout the entire company. So we'll continue to drive towards greater efficiencies. And when the -- you asked about how much do we incur in the restructuring charges related to Fox. Overall, Fox restructuring charges were $1.7 billion. And $1.2 billion of that was incurred in fiscal 2019 so $500 million was done this year. And in this quarter where we had about a little under $400 million of restructuring charges a portion of that was also Fox related. It comes out to about a little over -- a little less than 30%. So the balance was related to our cuts at \u2013 reductions-in-force at Parks. Okay. Hi, Doug, we're not \u2013 the comments that I gave on the Hotstar Disney+ India subs, we just don't comment on those economics. So unfortunately, we can't give you any more detail on that. Hi, John. It's Christine. You're right that our cash and cash equivalents are a very healthy $18 billion. That's down from $23 billion in the prior quarter. Just to put some context around the reduction we lowered our commercial paper balances by almost $5 billion. And we also had some bond maturities over $1 billion that we took care of. But we are still generating operating cash and we are investing in our content now. We're spending a lot of our productions are back up and running. So we're going to manage this. But as we ramp up even more additional new productions we will be spending more cash on that, but we'll follow this up. And when the peak of investment is anticipated we will update you with that information on December 10. Mike and on Hulu, overall, I would say that we're seeing very, very strong demand for advertising on Hulu in the addressable market. But the year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted on a per sub basis by what we're seeing in the advertising market overall in Q3 and Q4. But we're going to talk more about Hulu advertising in more detail at the Investor Day. So, just hold on until December 10, and hopefully we can answer all your questions then."

            "name": "Bob Chapek",
            "content": "Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. As we close out the fourth quarter and reflect back on the year, I think we'd all agree it's been a year unlike any other in our lifetimes, and certainly in the history of The Walt Disney Company. Despite the many challenges and hardships, I'm proud to say we have been steadfast in effectively managing our businesses under enormously difficult circumstances. We haven't just persevered during these tough times. We've also taken a number of deliberate steps and smart risks that have positioned our Company for greater long-term growth. And the impressive resilience Disney has demonstrated, while looking past today's challenges to set the stage for an even brighter future is direct reflection of our outstanding team. They've done and continue to do an admirable job, balancing the needs of our cast, our shareholders and our guests. Of course, the real bright spot amidst the pandemic has been our direct-to-consumer business. One year ago today, we launched Disney+, and it has quickly exceeded our highest expectations. We have since rolled out the services in more than 20 countries worldwide. And on Tuesday, we will launch in Latin America, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina followed by more overseas markets in the coming year. The response from consumers has been overwhelmingly positive. Everywhere that we've launched Disney+, audiences have embraced the wide array of high quality entertainment both original and library content. And I'm pleased to report that as of the end of the fourth quarter, Disney+ had more than 73 million paid subscribers, far surpassing our expectations in just its first year, and we're continuing to see positive trends. During our Investor Day presentation on December 10, we will provide an update of our global subscriber numbers. The growth of Disney+ speaks volumes about the strength of our IP, our unparalleled brands and franchises and our amazing content creators, all part of the Disney difference that sets us apart from everyone else. And when you look across our full suite of streaming service, we have exceeded 120 million paid subscriptions worldwide with impressive subscriber gains for ESPN+ and Hulu, including the rapidly growing Hulu +Live TV. We expect the international launch of our Star-branded general entertainment offering will enable us to grow our business even further in the years ahead. Given that our DTC business is key to the future growth of our company, we've restructured our media and entertainment businesses. By separating content creation from distribution, we've been able to streamline our processes and better align the organization, towards these important strategic objectives, as we accelerate our pivot to a DTC-first business model. We intend to build upon the success we've achieved thus far. And look forward to sharing more of our plans with you, at our upcoming Investor Day. While the pandemic continues to impact our company, resulting in an adjusted loss of $0.20 a share in the fourth quarter, the prolonged situation has prompted us to find new and innovative ways to deal with the difficult and often unpredictable challenges we're facing. We successfully made adjustments and have resumed many of our operations, clearly demonstrating the resiliency The Walt Disney Company is known for. While many of our productions were shut down beginning in March due to COVID, our animation teams were able to work remotely and have continued production uninterrupted during the pandemic. We were also fortunate to keep other parts of our creative pipeline active, and to continue post-production work for our Media Networks studios and Disney+. We've been able to develop processes and institute health and safety measures that have made it possible to resume live-action production as well. Of course, the unpredictability of COVID may result in unforeseen impacts to current and future productions. On the studio side, we have restarted or completed production, on all of the projects previously impacted by COVID, including ones from our Marvel Studios, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, Disney Live-Action and Lucasfilm. And we anticipate having eight new projects up and running, by January. On TV side, we now have more than 100 live-action, scripted and unscripted projects in active production with dozens more in various stages of pre or post production. Across all platforms, there has been a great response to our content. A couple of weeks ago, we rolled out the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian to rave reviews and incredible social buzz. There's been much excitement surrounding the announcement that Disney Pixar's Soul will be debuting on Disney+ on Christmas Day. And on the broadcasting side, ABC is now ranked number one, delivering some of the most popular and most watched shows on television, including Dancing with the Stars and The Conners. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge our incredible, local and national ABC News teams for the outstanding work they continue to do, under very difficult circumstances.  They've been working around the clock, making sure viewers nationwide have access to the most important and accurate information, particularly as it pertains to the COVID pandemic. And they've also done an outstanding job reporting on the election, in an informative and balanced way. From Good Morning America holding its spot as the number one morning news cast, for the eighth straight year to World News Tonight with David Muir, consistently ranking as the number one evening newscast as well as the number one program on all broadcast and cable television in the U.S. over the summer, there is no question ABC News is America's number one news source. On the park side, we've proven over many months that we're able to operate our parks responsibly, following strictly enforced guidelines provided by health care experts, successfully reopening our parks in Orlando, Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong. We've also reopened Disneyland Paris for several months, although the resort is now temporarily closed due to President Macron's recent lockdown order in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in Europe. People have shown a willingness to visit our parks, which I believe is a testament to the fact that they feel confident in the measures we've taken. And we are very encouraged by the positive news earlier this week on the progress of potential vaccines. Unfortunately, we are extremely disappointed that the State of California continues to keep Disneyland closed despite our proven track record. Our health and safety protocols are all science-based and have the support of labor unions representing 99% of our hourly cast members. Frankly as we and other civic leaders have stated before, we believe state leadership should look objectively at what we've achieved successfully at our parks around the world all based on science as opposed to setting an arbitrary standard that is precluding our cast members from getting back to work while decimating small businesses in the local community. Our ability to operate responsibly in this pandemic environment extends beyond our theme parks. I'm proud to say that we were successfully able to host the NBA and MLS at Walt Disney World in Orlando. It's been a huge undertaking and a great achievement. Just consider the NBA for example: 94 days, 22 teams, 172 games, players, broadcast partners, referees, media, support staff and Disney employees all in the bubble. It was also a big win for ESPN, which broadcast the games along with a packed schedule of other sports offerings including the WNBA, college football, Major League Baseball and the NFL. As you look at the most watched cable shows on TV this year more than half have been live sports proving that sports are a powerful draw despite the disruption of the pandemic. ESPN Digital and ESPN+ have also performed exceptionally well with September being the best month ever for ESPN streaming video. ESPN+ continues its positive subscriber growth reaching more than 10 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter, nearly tripling in size over the past year. As you can see, even during these most uncertain times, here's The Walt Disney Company. We are finding ways to not only operate our businesses effectively, but also take the necessary bold steps for our future growth. And we are more committed than ever to investing in our businesses in particular our DTC strategy, which we see as the key driver of significant long-term value for our company. We look forward to sharing details of our plans with you at our Investor Day next month. We also can't wait for you to see the extraordinary content that's being created for our full portfolio of streaming services: Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Star. It's just fantastic. And with that I'll turn it over to Christine. All right. Thank you, Lowell. Hi, Michael. In terms of ESPN and the cost cuts, we are obviously watching our costs across all of our operating units very carefully, in light of the adversity that we're facing with the pandemic. But long-term, as we look at our content rights, well we're looking at it from a shareholder standpoint. If it's accretive to shareholder value, then there are decisions that we make going forward in terms of looking at new rights, as they expire. And what we want to put on to our service. So we're being very deliberate and we're being very careful. And analyzing everything to make sure that it would be something, that would be additive to us. And I might say that, we've got very good relationships with all the leagues. And it's important. We continue to believe in sports. As a matter of fact in 2019, 93 of the top 100 programs in viewership on television were sports. And as you know, we've got the most trusted brand out there in the world, in terms of sports. So we believe that's a nice recipe for future success. But we realize that the world is changing. And there's a lot of dynamics at play. But we'll only do continue rights deals as long as they add shareholder value. In terms of the second question and in terms of the looking at the number of films and the amount of content that we put into the system, you're right. Over time we've been very, very discriminate, in terms of what types of films we make and how many we make. And I think that's really benefited the company. We're in a world though now in a subscription business, where we're managing churn. And we've got a unique combination of assets in this company that are all at play right now in Disney+, where we've not only got the most desirable library in the world, but we realize and that really helps by the way minimize churn. But we also realize that new content that we put add subscribers. It's very clear to us, that new content adds subscribers. So I think you'll see a continued increase in investment, in our direct-to-consumer platforms. And that will then fuel, some of the growth that Christine will talk about at the investor conference, that we expect on December 10. Okay. Great. So from a studio content standpoint, we were very pleased with the results of Mulan as a premier access title. And as you remember that was our very first foray into a strategy like premier access. Unfortunately that title met with some controversy both in the U.S. and internationally shortly after we released it. But we saw enough very positive results before that controversy started to know that we've got something here in terms of the premier access strategy. And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the investor conference in December. In terms of Soul, we also realized though that part of the lifeblood of Disney+ is providing great content to the base level subscribers that are in there in premier or in Disney+. And so the idea is that, we thought it was a really nice gesture to our subscribers to take Soul during the holiday period and provide that as part of the service. But I think what we've learned with Mulan is that there's going to be a role for it strategically with our portfolio of offerings. And again we're going to talk more about that at the investor conference in December. In terms of our opportunities to continue to improve parks, we're actually very encouraged by what we're seeing right now in our parks across the world. There's really two dynamics that are going on. Number one, our park operators which as you know are the best in the world are becoming much more efficient and effective in operating under COVID guidelines. And we've been able to pretty materially increase our capacity and still stay within the guidelines that local governments are giving us for example 6-foot social distancing. And this is happening across our parks across the world. In fact Walt Disney World which was at a 25% capacity constraint which was our industrial engineering estimates to keep 6-foot social distancing now has been able to increase to 35% of capacity. So almost a 50% increase in the number of guests that we can allow in and still adhere to the local guidelines and the guidelines that are stipulated by the CDC with the 6-foot social distancing. So we're very pleased by how we've become adept at operating under these constraints. But the second thing that's even more encouraging is the demanding -- demand that's growing for our parks across the world. I think it says two different things. Number one shows the love that guests have for our experiences that we have within our parks and the tremendous IP that we as a company have. But I also think it speaks to the trust that people have given the track record that we now have after months of operating across the globe with very stringent guidelines. And we're very pleased with our track record. And I think people are now through forward bookings and reservations showing some very encouraging signs about their willingness to come and spend time with us at a Disney park. And in terms of the question on the reorganization, I would suggest that maybe given everything that's happening in the world this is the perfect time for us to do such a reorganization. And I'm 100% confident that this is going to play out exactly as we had intended. It's going extremely well. And despite the disruption in everyone's roles, I think we have 100% buy in. I think we have 100% buy in because we have clarity on accountability which everyone really likes. And we separate out roles to what people tend to do best. Content does what they do best and same with distribution. So distribution who manages the P&L will set the parameters for our annual and long-term budget framework that's been agreed to on the slate with the content creators. And then the content creators then green light the individual projects that then shepherd development and production. So essentially distribution is now able to optimize the commercialization without maybe too much unnecessary regard for legacy distribution platforms, but at the same time our creatives who as you know are the best in the world are really free to do what they do. And that's just make the best content and storytelling possible. A lot of collaboration between the two groups, but ultimately some level of independence in terms of each being what they can be and doing their jobs best. Okay. I'm going to take the last one first. In terms of sports ratings, sports ratings we feel that in context of everything that's happening are actually holding up quite well. But we would be careful not to draw any conclusions about the ultimate health of sports sort of the long-term impact that you suggested during this pandemic. We really think that we're sort of looking at apples and oranges here. I think the best comp we probably have is the NFL, which has been relatively flat. Our Monday night football viewership has been down 4% relatively modest despite all the headwinds. I mean, we've got the risk of seasons not finishing. To your point, we don't have fans in the stands. We have the risk of games individually every week being canceled. We have election news as competition. And we really can't have our fans doing what they like to do the best which is watch in a communal setting. They pretty much are watching by themselves. Despite all those headwinds, the fact that our Monday night football business is relatively flat in terms of viewership is really I think really encouraging. And if you adjust if you will viewership over the last couple of months for the amount of available content, you see that they kind of slide together. So we actually don't have any concerns about the long-term health of sports. Obviously, we've got some headwinds as it pertains to short-term challenges and hurdles. But we think that all in all in context, the health of sports is pretty decent given everything that's going on. In terms of India, obviously we have an executive there Uday Shankar who we love and we wish him well. He gave us some indication several months ago that he was thinking of moving on. We've got a really deep bench there. And we feel that we have all kinds of opportunities and a lot of success so far with Disney+. And we have no reason to believe that that success won't continue and even accelerate going forward. And in terms of cruise ships, as you know, we just got new guidelines from the CDC that are quite thorough let's say. And they really entail some really high hurdles in terms of not only testing by the potential guests that we host on the ships, but also a process that has to happen in order to certify our first sailings. Those will necessarily result in delays beyond what we had hoped in terms of getting our ships back in service and making magic for our guests. I guess, the best news out of all of it is that, we now do see some light at the end of the tunnel. I think we have an opportunity to create sort of a Disney bubble, if you want \u2013 if you would on each one of our cruise ships. And demand is very, very strong for our cruise ships. We're seeing extremely strong demand in the back half of FY 2021, and all of 2022 in terms of \u2013 of bookings. That said, that then creates the demand for the new ships that you asked about. And right now we're anticipating delivering our first new ship The Wish in summer of 2022. And then we have our next two ships in 2024 and 2025. And so after a slight delay of roughly six months on those ships, we think that we're going to be able to bring them on to service. We hope and expect that the world will back to normal by then, and anticipate having a fine time trying to fill up the demand of those ships. And we think there's going to be so much pent-up demand that, we don't expect to have much issues given the love that our guests have for Disney Cruise Lines. In terms of the distribution deals and sort of the changing the landscape over time with those, we're really pleased with our partnerships to date. We try to limit them. We don't do too many, but we use them to strategically pursue growth of our subscriber base and lower subscriber acquisition costs. So as you know, we have one or two of these in each market. That's about it. But it really does help us sort of provide a base during our growth phase, and we've got full flexibility over time to either ramp those up, or ramp those down as we see fit. Yeah. I think the guardrails are good common sense as it pertains to managing cash. With our parks business sort of being \u2013 having an anchor on it, if you will that we can't properly operate our parks business like we'd like to we have to be a little bit more careful today than we might have to be in the future. But I'm just going to suggest that when we talk to everybody on December 10, I think you're going to see that we're going to put a lot of wind in the sails of our Disney+ business and heavily invest in it. And so the guardrails are just the only ones that would be the constraints that we face today in terms of cash. Other than that everything is really full speed forward. And of course we've got our linear networks that we're managing. We've made some reductions just this last week at ESPN as we manage the transition from linear to more of a digital experience and direct-to-consumer experience. And so as we toggle that balance between sort of the legacy old media businesses to the new media businesses, we'll do it aggressively, but we will watch it from a cash standpoint in the meantime. And my answers are going to be relatively the same in terms of the programming between our linear and our DTC business. First of all, Christine will talk about sort of the guidance at the investor conference specifically in terms of we have our losses peaked, which was your direct question and will update though. Additionally, we will be investing heavily. We'll talk again about -- more about this at the investor conference, but we are going to continue to ramp up our investment in DTC. And we will be heavily tilting the scale from linear networks over to our DTC business, as we see that as we said in our opening comments our primary catalyst for growth as a company. So, again, we're going to talk a lot more about this on December 10, but you will see a heavy tilt. Okay. In terms of the -- sort of the cord cutters and solutions for the cord cutters, I won't speak to what the leagues' thoughts are. I'll leave that up to them. But I will tell you that we've got a product that we're really excited about and has experienced some rapid growth and that's Hulu + Live TV. And it really gives the utility that consumers might normally find from the cable or satellite subscriber and be able to get it over-the-top directly to their homes. And I think this will increasingly act as a solution to those households that have walked away from their traditional, more traditional cable type of subscriptions and potentially slide it + Live TV. And that's one of the reasons why we're really bullish about that business. I'm a personal big fan of it. I use it. And it's really slick. It's very elegant, and it really is a big solution provider. It's really the complete solution, I think. So we're excited about that in terms of solving a consumer need for those consumers as you mentioned that have all walked away from that particular way of distributing and receiving content."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon and welcome to the Walt Disney Company's third quarter 2020 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a copy of the webcast and a transcript will also be available on our website. We realize most of you are joining us today from your homes and we hope everyone is doing well. We are also hosting today's call remotely. So, joining me from their phones are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll be happy to take some questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob Chapek to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone, I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. These continue to be challenging times for our world. The impact of the pandemic on people's lives, our communities, businesses and way of life has been devastating, and we remain deeply appreciative of the healthcare workers, researchers, community leaders and everyone doing their part to get us through this difficult period. Along with the challenges posed by the pandemic, the issues of racism and social injustice have also been front and center in ours and the nation's consciousness in recent months. We have been working closely with our employees and cast members in this critical area and have established six new strategic pillars to achieve greater diversity and inclusion across the company. We are committed to strongly advancing these initiatives as we strive towards greater representation and inclusion both in our workforce and creative content. As you know, the majority of businesses worldwide have experienced unprecedented disruption as a result of the pandemic. Most of our businesses were shut down and this had a huge impact on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.08 a share compared to $1.34 a share last year. Christine will talk more in depth about our results for the quarter. Despite the harsh realities we are facing today, we have made some encouraging progress. Since our last earnings call, we've begun a responsible phased reopening of our parks in Shanghai, Paris, Tokyo, and Orlando, as well as our shopping and dining area Downtown Disney in Anaheim. We have prioritized the health and safety of our cast members and guests and have instituted protocols that include a mandatory mask policy, temperature screenings, increased cleaning and disinfecting, as well as capacity restrictions to promote social distancing. We continue to work with national and local health and government officials in this very fluid situation and are making adjustments as necessary. Along with millions of fans, we're also pleased with the return of major live sports on ESPN including the successful resumption of the NBA and MLS seasons within the Walt Disney World bubble and restarts of the WNBA and MLB. Another positive development to note has been the initial restarting of some of our television and film productions, both domestically and overseas. When I became CEO in February, I emphasized that we will continue to pursue bold innovation thoughtful risk taking and the creative storytelling, that is the lifeblood of the Walt Disney Company, and despite the challenges of the pandemic, we've managed to take deliberate and innovative steps in running our businesses. At the same time, we've also been very focused on advancing and growing our direct-to-consumer business, which we see as our top priority and key to the future of our company. Last November, we successfully launched Disney+ domestically and we've since rolled it out in a number of major international markets, including Western Europe, India and Japan. I am also incredibly pleased to announce that, as of yesterday, we have surpassed 60.5 million paid subscribers globally, far exceeding our initial projections for the service. As our global sub numbers continue to grow, we've also exceeded our internal subscriber projections in every major market we've launched thus far. The tremendous success of Disney+ in less than a year clearly establishes us as a major force in the global direct-to-consumer space. We will continue our international expansion with the launch of Disney+ in the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September, and in Latin America this November. And I'm happy to announce that we will also be rolling out Disney+ Hotstar on September 5 in Indonesia, one of the world's most populous countries. By year-end, Disney+ will be available in nine of the top 10 economies in the world. When you look across our full portfolio of direct-to-consumer businesses, at Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, our combined global reach now exceeds an astounding 100 million paid subscriptions. This is a significant milestone and a reaffirmation of our strategy for growth. In fact, the incredible success we've achieved to date has made us even more confident about the future of our direct-to-consumer business and our ability to be more aggressive in our approach. Going forward, this confidence, coupled with the trends we're seeing in the multi-channel universe, will lead us to pursue even more innovative and bold initiatives as we continue to grow the business. I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you some of our upcoming plans and then we'll provide you more details at an investor presentation that we will host in the upcoming months. We've already demonstrated an aggressive approach to our content creation pipeline accelerating the Disney+ debuts of Frozen 2, Pixar's Onward and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, fast-tracking the debut of Broadway's Hamilton to Disney+, which has been a huge success. By combining the best elements of live theater, film and streaming, we have given millions of viewers a whole new way to experience this iconic cultural phenomenon. And last week, Beyonce's visual album, Black is King, premiered on Disney+, had critical acclaim, it's being widely celebrated for its diverse cast, stunning artistry and inspiring interpretation of the black experience. Both Hamilton and Black is King have clearly shown the power of the Disney+ platform for premiering world-class content. And there's more great content coming to the service. Highlights include Disney live actions, The One and Only Ivan, which will stream exclusively on the service beginning August 21 and the right stuff from National Geographic about NASA's Project Mercury which is set to premiere this fall. And millions of fans are anxiously awaiting the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian in October. The blockbuster series was just honored last week with an incredible 15 Emmy nominations including Outstanding Drama Series, a first for a debut streaming service. It also bears noting that the Walt Disney Company's television, cable, studio productions and streaming entities received an impressive 145 Primetime Emmy nominations, 92 were for programming content produced by our entities, which really speaks to the power of our creative engines across the company. As I said earlier, we've been able to begin resuming some of our creative pipeline activities amidst the pandemic and we're confident that when we can fully resume operations, we will be able to do so in a meaningful way with some of the best creative teams and most popular franchises in the industry. Like many companies, we've had to find innovative ways to conduct our business during the pandemic. While we view this as a devastating situation for everyone affected, it's also forced us to consider different approaches and look for new opportunities. In the process, we're discovering ways to better serve our consumers during this challenging period. Unfortunately, we've had to delay the release of Disney's highly anticipated tentpole film Mulan a number of times due to the impact of COVID on theaters. In order to meet the needs of consumers during this unpredictable period, we thought it was important to find alternative ways to bring this exceptional family-friendly film to them in a timely manner. We are announcing today that in most Disney+ markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a number of countries in Western Europe, we will be offering Disney+ subscribers the epic adventure Mulan on Disney+ on a premier access basis beginning September 4. The price point will be $29.99 in the U.S. and will vary slightly in other countries. Simultaneously, we will be releasing the film theatrically in certain markets where currently we have no announced launch plans for Disney+ and where theaters are open. We see this as an opportunity to bring this incredible film to a broad audience currently unable to go to movie theaters, while also further enhancing the value and attractiveness of a Disney+ subscription with this great content. Given the rapid changes in consumer behavior, we believe it is more important than ever that we continue to grow our direct relationship with our customers, and to this end, I am also pleased to announce that we plan to launch an international direct-to-consumer general entertainment offering under the Star brand in calendar year 2021. Mirroring the strategy we successfully pursued with Disney+, the offering will be rooted in content we own from the prolific and critically acclaimed production engines and libraries of ABC Studios, Fox Television, FX, Freeform, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight. In many markets, the offering will be fully integrated into our established Disney+ platform from both a marketing and a technology perspective, and it will be distributed under the Star brand which has been successfully utilized by the company for other general entertainment platform launches, particularly with Disney+ Hotstar in India. The fact that Disney+ is growing as rapidly as it has both domestically and globally, clearly demonstrates the value of our content, and through the addition of our Star-branded general entertainment offering, we were further extending the value of that content internationally. Let me reiterate that we see tremendous opportunity in the direct-to-consumer space, and in the light of the success that we've achieved thus far with our global direct-to-consumer business and bolstered by our ability to deliver the exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling their consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for, we intend to take full advantage of that opportunity. To this end, as I mentioned, we will be hosting another Investor Day in the coming months, focused on our plans to accelerate the push into the direct-to-consumer marketplace across our Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and Star brands. Personally, I am as optimistic as I could be about our way forward and I'm excited to share more about our plans with you in the coming months. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our financial results in the fiscal third quarter were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, this quarter's diluted earnings per share were $0.08. I'll note this is the first quarter where results in both the current and prior-year period reflect a full quarter of operations from the 21CF assets we acquired. We estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption on our third quarter segment operating income was approximately $3 billion net of cost mitigations. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was the most severely affected with an adverse impact of $3.5 billion, while the puts and takes across our other businesses aggregated to a net benefit as lower revenues were generally offset by the benefit of cost deferrals and cost reductions. We expect many of these cost deferrals to reverse in future quarters due primarily to the timing shift of sporting events. As we reopen many of our businesses, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to addressing the safety of our cast members, talent and guests as well as various government regulations. These include but are not limited to incremental costs as it relates to responsibly resuming production of film and television content as well as the enhanced measures we have put into place at our parks and resorts. We estimate that through the end of fiscal 2021, these incremental cash costs could total approximately $1 billion. We expect many of these expenditures, particularly those related to restarting productions to be capitalized and amortized over future periods. At Parks, Experiences and Products, third quarter results largely reflect the closures of our domestic parks and resorts, cruise line business and Disneyland Paris for the entirety of the quarter. Our Shanghai and Hong Kong resorts were also closed for part of the quarter with Shanghai reopening on May 11 and Hong Kong reopening on June 18. However, Hong Kong was subsequently closed on July 15 due to a government order. As a result of these widespread disruptions, operating results at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of about $2 billion. These results also reflect an adverse impact at our Consumer Products business due to the effects of COVID-19. At Walt Disney World, we are achieving our objective of driving a positive net contribution at current attendance levels and we expect demand will grow when the COVID situation in Florida improves. We are also closely monitoring trends at our reopened sites internationally, and in particular, have been pleased with what we've seen at Shanghai since reopening in May. While uncertainty still exists regarding the timing for reopening some of our businesses, we remain committed to creating high quality experiences for all of our guests and are confident in our ability to generate long-term value through these assets. At Studio Entertainment, operating income decreased in the quarter as higher TV/SVOD distribution results, lower home entertainment marketing costs and lower film impairments were more than offset by lower theatrical distribution results. Worldwide theatrical results were adversely impacted by COVID-19. Given the closure of theaters, both domestically and internationally, no significant titles were released in the quarter. This resulted in a difficult comparison against the outstanding performance of Avengers End Game in the prior-year quarter. Higher TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+ including library titles, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties in the pay window. Turning to Media Networks, operating income was up in the third quarter due to higher results at both Broadcasting and Cable. At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was due to lower programming and production costs, an increase in affiliate revenue, higher program sales and lower marketing costs. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to production shutdowns as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by a timing impact from new accounting guidance. You may recall that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expenses during the first half of the fiscal year, we have said that we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. Higher programming sales in the quarter were driven by titles including The Simpsons, Modern Family, and The Politician. Total broadcasting ad revenue was down 17% in the quarter, driven by decreases at our owned television stations and the ABC Network. Higher results at cable networks are primarily due to increases at ESPN and FX Networks. ESPN benefited from lower programming and production costs and to a lesser extent higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. FX Networks benefited from lower marketing and programming costs. At ESPN, lower programming and production costs were largely due to the deferral of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball. We currently expect these games to be played in future quarters and the rights costs will be incurred accordingly. Total ESPN advertising revenue was down significantly in the third quarter due to the impact of COVID-19 and the absence of the NBA and other significant live sports programming. Several live sporting events have already returned to ESPN this quarter including Major League Soccer on July 8, Major League Baseball on July 23, and the NBA just last Friday. Assuming the resumption of live sports continues as planned, we expect ESPN's ad sales in Q4, including the benefit of the 53rd week, to benefit significantly, particularly from the NBA. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 2%. This was driven by 7 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a four-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which benefited by about 2 points due to the launch of the ACC network. At our direct-to-consumer and International segment, operating losses were approximately $140 million higher in the quarter compared to last year, driven by costs associated with the launch of Disney+ which expanded into several new markets during the third quarter, partially offset by improved results at Star and ESPN+. During the third quarter, we launched Disney+ in India via our Disney+ Hotstar service, in France, the strategic partnership with Canal+, and in Japan via a limited launch with NTT DOCOMO. At the end of the quarter, Disney+ had a paid subscriber base of 57.5 million, which as Bob mentioned, has now grown to 60.5 million as of August 3. Given the unique nature of our India offering, it's worth noting that Disney+ Hotstar comprised about 15% of our quarter-end subscribers. As it relates to ARPU. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.62. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.31. At Star, higher results reflect lower programming costs, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Both of these drivers reflect the absence of cricket in the third quarter including a shift in rights costs for the Indian Premier League which we expect to be recognized in future quarters and the absence of costs for the quadrennial ICC World Cup which aired in the prior-year quarter. ESPN+ operating results improved versus the prior year quarter due to subscriber growth and an increase in UFC pay-per-view income. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $200 million which came in better than the guidance we provided last quarter, primarily due to the better than expected results at Disney+ and Hulu. This outperformance, along with lower-than-expected expenses at our international channels, contributed to the segment's overall operating loss of approximately $700 million coming in better than our prior guidance. Note that our third quarter segment results at DTCI excluded approximately $5 billion of impairment charges related to our international channels business, which is included in our calculation of as reported earnings per share. These impairment charges reflect the underperformance of these assets due to COVID-19 as well as the impact of our accelerated push into direct-to-consumer streaming services in the midst of declines in our international MVPD subscriber base. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which we expect to file shortly. We expect to our direct-to-consumer and international segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the fourth quarter. And we expect the Q4 operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior-year quarter, driven by lower losses at Hulu and ESPN+ partially offset by our continued investment in Disney+. The 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of inter-segment eliminations, contributed approximately $730 million in segment operating income in the third quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out inter-segment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $490 million. While some of our affected businesses have reopened, we remain laser focused on prudently managing our cash outflows and preserving liquidity. We further strengthened our capital position during the quarter by issuing $11 billion of term debt in May at highly attractive rate. And we reduced our commercial paper balances by close to $2 billion during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $23 billion in cash and continue to feel we are well positioned to navigate through this time of uncertainty and continue to invest in the long-term future growth of our businesses. As we look ahead, there are a handful of items that we would like to give you an update on. First, you may recall that our fiscal 2020 calendar has an extra week of operations. This year, we expect that 53rd week will actually have a modest adverse impact on operating results in Q4 due to our current expectations of NBA finals, MLB playoffs and IPL games all occurring in the 53rd week, in addition to modest operating loss at Parks, Experiences, and Products. At Parks, Experiences, and Products. It's worth noting that while Walt Disney World is operating at a positive net contribution level, the upside we are seeing some reopening is less than we had originally expected given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Florida. We also anticipate Q4 results at our Consumer Products business will reflect a difficult comparison to Frozen and Star Wars merchandise sales in the prior-year quarter as well as the ongoing disruption of retail operations caused by COVID-19. Finally, we have continued to refine our capital spending plan and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be approximately $700 million lower than prior year, largely due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts. These are certainly fluid times and we are proud of our management team and cast members for going above and beyond to position our company well for a very exciting future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Christine. And as we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate by directing your questions to the appropriate executive, and with that, Daniel, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAlexia Quadrani: I have two questions. The first one is on the studio and the second one the parks. On the studio, do you think moving sort of big tentpole films, you know, direct-to-consumer is going to be more of a common occurrence for Disney? Or is Mulan kind of a one-off? I mean, how should we think about Black Widow I guess later in the fall? And then on the parks, I guess any color on how much the accretive opening of Walt Disney World is eating away the losses in the parks. I think you said. Christine, that it's eating away or it's less accretive maybe than you thought it would be initially because of the surge of Corona. I'm curious to that because demand isn't as strong as you thought it would be or because you're just having to keep capacity lower and more careful because of the surge. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Alexia, thanks. Bob, why don't we - let's start with first question, why don't you take the studio question and then we'll get to the parks one.\nBob Chapek: We are very pleased to be able to bring Mulan to our consumer base has been waiting for it for a long, long time as we've had to unfortunately move our theatrical dates several times. We are fortunate that we have the opportunity to bring it to our own direct-to-consumer platforms. So consumers can enjoy it. But we're looking at Mulan as a one-off in terms of, as opposed to say trying to say that there is some new business window we model that we're looking at. So Mulan is a one-off. That said, we find it very interesting to be able to take a new offering, our premier access offering to consumers at that $29.99 price and learn from it and see what happens not only in terms of the uptake of the number of subscribers that we get on the platform, but the actual number of transactions on the Disney+ platform that we get on that PVOD offering.\nLowell Singer: And then on the parks question, Bob, maybe want to speak to demand, and then Christine, you could jump in on some of the numbers.\nBob Chapek: Yes, this is obviously a highly uncertain time and we could tell from our reservation stream that we had ample demand to go above what the six-foot social distancing guidelines would give us, that was six weeks before we opened the park when we announced we were opening the park and then unfortunately COVID struck again and all the numbers started going up. This gave some level of trepidation to travelers who are anxious about long distance travel, jumping on a plane and flying to Walt Disney World. So what we've seen is that we have roughly 50% of our guest base still traveling from a distance, but the other 50% coming from local markets and in state. We've also had a higher-than-expected level of cancellations once somebody does make a reservation because as the disease ebbs and flows, they might necessarily cancel. So what we've done is used our strategy for yielding and make sure that every day we're pretty close to the percentage of the park that we can fill and still maintain the social distancing, we just replaced local and annual pass holders with some of the fall-off that we've necessarily seen from the long distance travelers. I will say that our research indicates that - and our bookings indicate that we should be in good shape once consumer confidence sort of returns, and so we're very optimistic about that, but we're very happy that we're returning a positive net contribution, as Christine said, because that was our goal in the first place, while at the same time, operating very responsibly.\nChristine McCarthy: Alexia, I'll put a little context into what we're referring to as a net positive contribution. On our last earnings call, Bob mentioned that we would not be opening a park unless we believe that we could shortly after opening generate revenue that exceeded the variable costs. So we are able to do that, although it is to a lesser extent because of the current COVID situation in Florida, as we said, as that abates, we expect the demand to pick up. But right now, it's not as high as we had expected, but we're still in the net positive contribution level. And I'd also like to mention Shanghai has consistently been operating in that net positive contribution area as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: I wanted to ask about the international general entertainment DTC launch, which I think is not a huge surprise that you're moving forward although calendar '21 I think a bit earlier than we were expecting, but doing it under the Star brand is an interesting twist versus a Hulu. I'm wondering if you could just give us a sense for the strategy there and what you're looking at in terms of case of deployment, anything you can tell us, I'm sure there's a lot coming in the Investor Day about that strategy because obviously that's a big news. And then just following along on direct-to-consumer, forget about Mulan for a second, but from your access as an offering is an interesting strategy, I'm just wondering what your research tells you about that approach versus offering more content as part of the Disney+ subscription? We haven't seen sort of this idea of subscription service with the kind of a pay-per-view element on top of it, which is really interesting. I'm wondering if you're thinking about using that on a regular basis globally on the Disney+ platform? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks for the questions, Ben, and I'll turn those over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: In terms of the general entertainment offering internationally, we want to mirror successful Disney+ strategy by using our Disney+ technical platform, rooting it in content that we already own and distributing it under a successful international brand that we also already own which is of course Star and then bringing it to market in a very close association to Disney. I think in terms of your being surprised that this isn't being launched under a different brand name, I think it's important to look at the differences in how we have plan on going into the market, and the first thing is that Hulu aggregates third-party content where this will not. This will be rooted in our own content from ABC studios, Fox TV, FX, Freeform, Searchlight, and 20th century, and Hulu also, I must say has no brand awareness outside of the U.S. and nor does Hulu have any content that's been licensed to it internationally. So this gives us the ability to market this under the Disney umbrella and have synergies with our existing platform. So that's our basic rationale there. In terms of the premier access idea, as you probably know, Disney tentpole blockbuster theatrical films can be fairly expensive to make and produce in order to get the quality that consumers expect from us and frankly to get the quality that we expect from us, and rather than simply rolling it into a free offering, we thought we would give again because we can test almost anything when you have your own platform, we thought we would give it a try to establish a new window - a premier access window to try to recapture some of that investment that we've got and the good news, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is that we're going to have a chance to learn from this and to see whether that makes sense. All I'll say about our research is that it shows that such an offering under a premier access offering not only gets us revenue from the original transaction from the PVOD but also acts as a fairly large stimulus to sign up for Disney+.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: A couple of questions. First, could you provide updates on some of your past guidance, specifically on Disney+, you've exceeded your low-end of your five-year outlook, but you haven't said anything about reaching break-even sooner or not. And within the Disney+, if you could give us some color on Japan, which has always been a very enthusiastic Disney branded market. But the other update was on Fox, the Fox synergy, the $2 billion that you've given us in the past. And then just moving on to kind of current stuff on production, I mean obviously with the new protocols, costs will go up. If can you give us any color on what percent or how you think about that and who will be bearing the cost of that? Will there - do you expect to get a national insurance plan in place? I mean just there's so much complication there and then I was just hoping you could talk about maybe the original ramp, how will you prioritize getting back to work on production?\nLowell Singer: All right, Jessica, it's good to hear from you. We will try to get to as many of your questions as we can. So Christine, let's start with Jessica's question about Disney+ guidance, and Japan and synergies. Let's start with that group.\nChristine McCarthy: We'll see if I can remember all these in sequential order. So on updating guidance, we're in the process now of working through our long-term plan, just because of COVID and all the disruption to our business, it's a little bit delayed from a typical calendar schedule, but we are not going to update piecemeal, we're going to give you a full update of the guidance we provided at the original Investor Day when we do the upcoming Investor Day in a few months. So you can expect to hear a fulsome review of the guidance and what we're looking for now because obviously things have gone better than expected and we are growing into momentum here. On Japan, Disney+ launched on June 11 in Japan and it wasn't a full - I would call it a limited launch, it was an exclusive alliance with NTT DOCOMO, so that was not provide - you had to be an NTT DOCOMO subscriber in order to have that ability. So you shouldn't be looking that at a full country launch. So I think you can anticipate that once it is launched, there will be more demand for Disney+ in that market, because you're absolutely right, there is a very, very high affinity for the Disney brand in Japan. I think you also had a question on Fox synergies. We are still on track to achieve the synergies that we had discussed originally and that is going along. Even despite COVID, we're still proceeding\nLowell Singer: And then just got a question about restarting production as well. Christine, do you want to take that one?\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. In my prepared comments, I said that we would incur around $1 billion of costs between now and the end of fiscal '21 and that's a variety of things, it's everything from ramping up productions and you can imagine these productions, they have everything from distancing that you have to accommodate for, site preparation, stage preparation, all the testing that has to go on. So there's a lot of increased costs and what those also will result in is increased days to produce episodes. So all of those things will incur costs. As I mentioned, we will be capitalizing Many of those costs that are related to productions and those will be amortized in future periods. And also in parks, as you've heard from us, there is considerable costs that have been put in place to achieve safety and health measures and those largely are expensed in the parks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Hodulik: Just maybe two quick ones. First, Bob, can you talk a bit about some of the new program you're going to have on the Disney+ platform in the fall. Are you confident that you've got a strong enough lineup that you can sustain the growth that you've recently seen both in the U.S. and some of these international markets given the production halt and the need to restart that? And then secondly, although it's not as immediate of a concern, but you guys suspended the dividend, I think that was on the last call, any thoughts to sort of reinstating that and sort of just capital allocation as we look forward and especially with the new sort of more aggressive stance on D2C. Thanks.\nLowell Singer: John, thanks for the questions. Bob, why don't you take the production question for the fall, and Christine, you'll take the dividend question\nBob Chapek: As you may suspect, while we've had to slow down production and cease it altogether In some cases during the COVID time, we've been busy developing new content and we're extremely excited about some of the things that we've got not only to sustain that linear growth that you talked about for Disney+ but actually go beyond that and grow it. We've got, of course, The Mandalorian 2 which we've announced is coming in October. But we've also got a slew of Marvel content that's going to be coming that we're very excited about and these require us to re-enter into production, but it's such a priority that we're hopeful that this will be coming shortly to enable us to again not only sustain but continue to grow and I would tell you that the content is fabulous, Loki, Falcon and Winter Soldier and Wandavision 3, Marvel properties that we're really, really excited about. And one of the things about Disney+ that we found is that new content tends to bring in new subscribers by catalog increases engagement and helps us retain subscribers. So I think that this new content having so much of this all at once that I think it's really going to go ahead and propel the business forward. Christine?\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, John. So let me just make a couple of comments on the dividend. As you know, management recommended and the Board decided to accept that recommendation not to pay dividend for the first half of fiscal '20 and that was the payment that would have been made in July and we all believe that that decision provided the company with additional financial flexibility given what we were seeing in the in the COVID environment we're in and all the uncertainty that we're dealing with and continue to deal with. So our Board would typically determine whether or not to declare a dividend for the second half of fiscal '20 in the latter part of the calendar year, it would be very late November, early December, and making the recommendation to the Board, we, again, were going to take into consideration. Where we are with COVID and the impact that it's having not only on our financial performance but what measures we are taking to mitigate COVID impacts. So we'll take the full financial picture into consideration and it is part of our overall capital allocation principles, but first and foremost, we are going to invest in businesses that we believe are going to drive long-term shareholder value, and you're seeing what we're doing in the direct-to-consumer initiatives, not only domestically with Disney+, internationally with Disney+ and now internationally with the General Entertainment channel. So we feel like that's certainly top of the list, but we are also looking at other measures like a dividend, but we won't make that decision or recommendation to the Board until the end of the close to the end of the calendar year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson: I have two for you Lowell. One is, on the rollout of the new channel, you talk a bit about how you think about the AVOD/SVOD hybrid that's worked in the U.S., is that the template to think about globally? And then this is just concerned about college football and pro football not being in a bubble and I wondered just generally what risk is there to affiliate fees if those seasons don't get completed? So anything to help us on on ESPN and maybe those sports that are not in a bubble and risk to your affiliate fees in the next six months or so.\nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks for the questions. Michael. Bob, do you want to take both of those.\nBob Chapek: Yes, in terms of the Star offering that we announced today, we see this as part of a sort of a sequential Domino strategy in terms of getting towards an offering on Disney+ starting with the PVOD going through some transactional window after we have an exclusive on Disney+ for the PVOD details to be announced later and then eventually going to Disney+ will live in perpetuity. Now, I should also say that we think that the Star brand itself in terms of its offerings, we've got a utility here, we've got a utility that is enabled on obviously platforms. I did mention to you that we will have the ability to use the same platform across both Disney+ and Star, so that if theoretically we can afford to do something on one particular platform like Disney+ we should be able to do it on a Star platform. It's not something we've talked about or entertained, but the capability is there. In terms of the Fox - in terms of the college football and the likelihood that in place, I don't really want to comment on the possibility of us going on the season going on because I think that's really up to the League Commissioners, that being said, we feel that we've got certain covenants that we have to meet in terms of live permitting hours with our partners, and we feel confident that with the way that we see all of the sports going on right now, we feel confident that we're going to be able to reach that.\nMichael Nathanson: Bob, is it just the AVOD/SVOD as strategy as you did with Hulu in the U.S.?\nBob Chapek: Yes, well, we have no planned AVOD/SVOD on Star itself, but we've got obviously similar capabilities as we've got to Disney+ if we ever so chose to do that, but we've got no plans to do that now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJason Bazinet: I love that you guys are always conservative with the capital and recognize you said it was a low cost of debt in terms of the latest capital raise, but $23 billion is a cash that sits on the balance sheet, it seems excessive even under the most dire scenarios in terms of free cash burn, you could anticipate. So can you maybe just explain a little bit behind your thinking behind that quantum of capital and what it might be used for? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Jason, thanks for the question. Christine, you want to take that.\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. Thanks, Jason. You're right. We do take somewhat of a conservative approach to managing liquidity and when we raise that money, it was back in March and April, we were able to achieve some pretty favorable interest rates but we also did not have any visibility into how long this environment was going to continue. We also saw some weeks in the spring when they weren't consistent capital markets conditions. So you'd have some weeks when spreads gapped out, sometimes they tighten up and we took the position that get it when we can and because the demand was so high we decided to take it because we view it somewhat as an insurance policy. But when we look at the overall balance sheet, we have it and we see COVID continuing for a while, but one of the, there is a few things that have happened in our businesses. And one is just the way that we have probably been much better at cost mitigation than we anticipated. The whole company is aligned towards tightening the belt. And we've done, I think, a great job on that. But as we are opening up the parks, remember now, we furloughed over 100,000 people and we're bringing them back. For the most part, not all are back yet, but a lot are back. So we will be spending more money just in terms of labor than we did in the third quarter. So in the fourth quarter you'll see some of our costs actually go up to resume some of our businesses. So I look at this as, as we all know what kills the company is the lack of liquidity. And as a CFO, I would never want to be in that position of not being able to fund all of our obligations.\nJason Bazinet: That makes perfect sense, but none of that capital is really earmarked to sort of pulling the minority stake in Hulu that you don't own, that was not part of that again?\nChristine McCarthy: No, if you look at that, that's out a couple of more years. So, and the other thing is we do have debt maturities coming up. We still have another about $1.1 billion this fiscal year. If my memory is correct. I think $3.5 billion for fiscal ' 21. So we've got some debt maturities that we don't have to go to market and if this cash is still on our balance sheet, we can just certainly repay that and not refinance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: So a couple if I could. First is, Christine, the $5 billion charge that you took for international markets, I guess this is a question for Bob as well. But broadly, does this mean that you could potentially use this as a way to pull more channels and go direct-to-consumer in other markets. I think you've done a little bit of that in the UK with some channels, but could that become a bigger possibility in other markets, now that you've written down this asset? And then secondly, Bob. From your perspective, when you look at ESPN obviously cord cutting is accelerating just given what the cable companies have said so far. Is there an alternative state of the world where ESPN could go direct to consumers and have you looked at that model in terms even perspective? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Kannan, thanks for the questions. Christine, why don't you speak to the $5 billion charge, and Bob, you speak to ESPN. Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: So that's a great question and I'm glad you asked that. So, I can put some color around this impairment. So, the best way I would frame it is this impairment reflects an underperformance of the international channels business that we are already seeing and then that was exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19. Coupled with that, we've learned a lot with the launch of Disney+ and we have, as you've heard today, accelerated our push into DTC consumer streaming and - with the same time you're seeing a decline in the subscriber on MVPD subscriber base outside of the U.S. So, you add all those things up and we're not - this impairment does not include the value of DTC, that's intact. What this impairment is about is the linear channels and so we have in this fiscal year, have already closed down more than 20 channels. Most of those were closed in this third quarter and they were primarily in APAC and in EMEA. Now, when I say APAC not in India, these are in other parts of Asia. But that's where the channels were closed and we're taking a look at going more quickly, as you said, into direct-to-consumer and these channels shutting them down and taking those platforms direct is certainly what is behind this impairment.\nBob Chapek: And in terms of the ESPN question, let me first start off by saying that on a macro level, I think we understand the value of live sports, ESPN is a strongest brand in sports and sports continue to be a driver of viewing interest. I think it's evidenced by the fact that sports accounted for over 90 of the 100 most viewed telecasts on broadcast and cable in 2019. So, we've got a really strong position from a brand standpoint in a market that consumers love. So, then the question is, how do we get it to the consumer and certainly U.S. that whether we've looked at a stronger direct-to-consumer proposition for ESPN? Absolutely, we've looked at everything and when we think that we've got the most effective way to maximize shareholder value from the brand, the way we are right now, but as that changes over time, we're certainly open to any and all options in terms of how we maybe able to get our programs to our consumers and hopefully we can talk a little bit more about this in our investor conference when we meet in the next few months.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nSteven Cahall: Maybe first just wanted to clarify on parks, Bob, with the lower contribution margin in Orlando, could you just help us think through some of that disruption that you had. Was that more about not being able to get as many people in the parks, or was that more of per capita spend or pricing issue that caused the contribution margin to come in lower? And maybe you could update a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of pricing and occupancy at the hotels as well. And then on Disney+ I'm curious, I mean you've had this amazing ramp up to the low end of guidance, as you think about the next stage of growth for Disney+, does it make more sense to kind of go after a bigger market of subscribers, which can be pretty expensive in terms of original content. Are you more kind of focused on getting to like more of a plateau with this Disney+ and driving it more towards profitability with the content that you've already got planned in the pipeline that's more around the film slate and the existing characters? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Steve maybe Christine you want to just at least start on the parks' metrics and then Bob, you may want to comment on parks and then talk about Disney+ as well.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Steve. So, when we were talking about the net positive contribution opening up Walt Disney World what we were referring to was that because there was a surge of COVID in Florida, which limited amount of inbound travel that we had originally anticipated. So, it's more local, that overall is having a little bit of a dampening effect on it, but it's still positive, and once again, it will pick up when there is more regular travel patterns going into Walt Disney World. And as it relates to sort of pricing and occupancy at the hotel, It's really like there are so many hotels that are not yet reopened. And so those are kind of meaningless numbers right now. So once I would say the travel patterns get a little more normalized and we see people going in and staying for regular vacations like they used to we'll be providing occupancy and booking numbers, but right now, the one thing I would add is per caps are very, very strong and you could say that that's probably because people haven't been in the parks for a while, there is a pent-up demand and let's not forget that we just opened the full - the rise of the resistance as well as the Star Wars Lands fully in the beginning of this calendar year. So, you had a lot of people and even Floridians who were just traveling locally who have not yet had an opportunity to go in and experience that. So, the per caps are great and I think it's because people haven't been able to get into our parks for quite a long time.\nBob Chapek: I'll follow up on the parks question is that, as you know, different guests depending on where they're coming from have different relative values in terms of their contribution as a guest to the park and typically someone who travels and stays for five days to seven days is marginally more valuable to the business than someone who comes in on an annual pass and stays a day or two and consumes less merchandise and food and beverage. So, the way I would look at it is that it's just as their constituency changes a little bit, so do our overall margins change, but it's not because of price reductions or anything like that. And I think Christine handled the pricing and occupancy in hotels. On the Disney+ we absolutely are going after a bigger market of the number of subscribers as opposed to over rotating to try to get to a profitability number much sooner than we thought. Although I must say the prospect of us hitting our goals as quickly as we are is very encouraging, but what we plan to do is invest even more in our content in order to keep that machine cranked and going. As I mentioned, one of the biggest things in terms of subscriber acquisition is having new hot [indiscernible] content to bring to the service and you get that by making investments in new content. So, we'll be investing in content first and then trying to grow the service both from a marketing standpoint and from an installed base standpoint.\nLowell Singer: Steve, thanks for the questions and thanks again everyone for joining us today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thanks Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our financial results in the fiscal third quarter were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, this quarter's diluted earnings per share were $0.08. I'll note this is the first quarter where results in both the current and prior-year period reflect a full quarter of operations from the 21CF assets we acquired. We estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption on our third quarter segment operating income was approximately $3 billion net of cost mitigations. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was the most severely affected with an adverse impact of $3.5 billion, while the puts and takes across our other businesses aggregated to a net benefit as lower revenues were generally offset by the benefit of cost deferrals and cost reductions. We expect many of these cost deferrals to reverse in future quarters due primarily to the timing shift of sporting events. As we reopen many of our businesses, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to addressing the safety of our cast members, talent and guests as well as various government regulations. These include but are not limited to incremental costs as it relates to responsibly resuming production of film and television content as well as the enhanced measures we have put into place at our parks and resorts. We estimate that through the end of fiscal 2021, these incremental cash costs could total approximately $1 billion. We expect many of these expenditures, particularly those related to restarting productions to be capitalized and amortized over future periods. At Parks, Experiences and Products, third quarter results largely reflect the closures of our domestic parks and resorts, cruise line business and Disneyland Paris for the entirety of the quarter. Our Shanghai and Hong Kong resorts were also closed for part of the quarter with Shanghai reopening on May 11 and Hong Kong reopening on June 18. However, Hong Kong was subsequently closed on July 15 due to a government order. As a result of these widespread disruptions, operating results at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of about $2 billion. These results also reflect an adverse impact at our Consumer Products business due to the effects of COVID-19. At Walt Disney World, we are achieving our objective of driving a positive net contribution at current attendance levels and we expect demand will grow when the COVID situation in Florida improves. We are also closely monitoring trends at our reopened sites internationally, and in particular, have been pleased with what we've seen at Shanghai since reopening in May. While uncertainty still exists regarding the timing for reopening some of our businesses, we remain committed to creating high quality experiences for all of our guests and are confident in our ability to generate long-term value through these assets. At Studio Entertainment, operating income decreased in the quarter as higher TV/SVOD distribution results, lower home entertainment marketing costs and lower film impairments were more than offset by lower theatrical distribution results. Worldwide theatrical results were adversely impacted by COVID-19. Given the closure of theaters, both domestically and internationally, no significant titles were released in the quarter. This resulted in a difficult comparison against the outstanding performance of Avengers End Game in the prior-year quarter. Higher TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+ including library titles, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties in the pay window. Turning to Media Networks, operating income was up in the third quarter due to higher results at both Broadcasting and Cable. At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was due to lower programming and production costs, an increase in affiliate revenue, higher program sales and lower marketing costs. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to production shutdowns as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by a timing impact from new accounting guidance. You may recall that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expenses during the first half of the fiscal year, we have said that we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. Higher programming sales in the quarter were driven by titles including The Simpsons, Modern Family, and The Politician. Total broadcasting ad revenue was down 17% in the quarter, driven by decreases at our owned television stations and the ABC Network. Higher results at cable networks are primarily due to increases at ESPN and FX Networks. ESPN benefited from lower programming and production costs and to a lesser extent higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. FX Networks benefited from lower marketing and programming costs. At ESPN, lower programming and production costs were largely due to the deferral of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball. We currently expect these games to be played in future quarters and the rights costs will be incurred accordingly. Total ESPN advertising revenue was down significantly in the third quarter due to the impact of COVID-19 and the absence of the NBA and other significant live sports programming. Several live sporting events have already returned to ESPN this quarter including Major League Soccer on July 8, Major League Baseball on July 23, and the NBA just last Friday. Assuming the resumption of live sports continues as planned, we expect ESPN's ad sales in Q4, including the benefit of the 53rd week, to benefit significantly, particularly from the NBA. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 2%. This was driven by 7 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a four-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which benefited by about 2 points due to the launch of the ACC network. At our direct-to-consumer and International segment, operating losses were approximately $140 million higher in the quarter compared to last year, driven by costs associated with the launch of Disney+ which expanded into several new markets during the third quarter, partially offset by improved results at Star and ESPN+. During the third quarter, we launched Disney+ in India via our Disney+ Hotstar service, in France, the strategic partnership with Canal+, and in Japan via a limited launch with NTT DOCOMO. At the end of the quarter, Disney+ had a paid subscriber base of 57.5 million, which as Bob mentioned, has now grown to 60.5 million as of August 3. Given the unique nature of our India offering, it's worth noting that Disney+ Hotstar comprised about 15% of our quarter-end subscribers. As it relates to ARPU. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.62. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.31. At Star, higher results reflect lower programming costs, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Both of these drivers reflect the absence of cricket in the third quarter including a shift in rights costs for the Indian Premier League which we expect to be recognized in future quarters and the absence of costs for the quadrennial ICC World Cup which aired in the prior-year quarter. ESPN+ operating results improved versus the prior year quarter due to subscriber growth and an increase in UFC pay-per-view income. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $200 million which came in better than the guidance we provided last quarter, primarily due to the better than expected results at Disney+ and Hulu. This outperformance, along with lower-than-expected expenses at our international channels, contributed to the segment's overall operating loss of approximately $700 million coming in better than our prior guidance. Note that our third quarter segment results at DTCI excluded approximately $5 billion of impairment charges related to our international channels business, which is included in our calculation of as reported earnings per share. These impairment charges reflect the underperformance of these assets due to COVID-19 as well as the impact of our accelerated push into direct-to-consumer streaming services in the midst of declines in our international MVPD subscriber base. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which we expect to file shortly. We expect to our direct-to-consumer and international segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the fourth quarter. And we expect the Q4 operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior-year quarter, driven by lower losses at Hulu and ESPN+ partially offset by our continued investment in Disney+. The 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of inter-segment eliminations, contributed approximately $730 million in segment operating income in the third quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out inter-segment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $490 million. While some of our affected businesses have reopened, we remain laser focused on prudently managing our cash outflows and preserving liquidity. We further strengthened our capital position during the quarter by issuing $11 billion of term debt in May at highly attractive rate. And we reduced our commercial paper balances by close to $2 billion during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $23 billion in cash and continue to feel we are well positioned to navigate through this time of uncertainty and continue to invest in the long-term future growth of our businesses. As we look ahead, there are a handful of items that we would like to give you an update on. First, you may recall that our fiscal 2020 calendar has an extra week of operations. This year, we expect that 53rd week will actually have a modest adverse impact on operating results in Q4 due to our current expectations of NBA finals, MLB playoffs and IPL games all occurring in the 53rd week, in addition to modest operating loss at Parks, Experiences, and Products. At Parks, Experiences, and Products. It's worth noting that while Walt Disney World is operating at a positive net contribution level, the upside we are seeing some reopening is less than we had originally expected given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Florida. We also anticipate Q4 results at our Consumer Products business will reflect a difficult comparison to Frozen and Star Wars merchandise sales in the prior-year quarter as well as the ongoing disruption of retail operations caused by COVID-19. Finally, we have continued to refine our capital spending plan and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be approximately $700 million lower than prior year, largely due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts. These are certainly fluid times and we are proud of our management team and cast members for going above and beyond to position our company well for a very exciting future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions. Alexia, I'll put a little context into what we're referring to as a net positive contribution. On our last earnings call, Bob mentioned that we would not be opening a park unless we believe that we could shortly after opening generate revenue that exceeded the variable costs. So we are able to do that, although it is to a lesser extent because of the current COVID situation in Florida, as we said, as that abates, we expect the demand to pick up. But right now, it's not as high as we had expected, but we're still in the net positive contribution level. And I'd also like to mention Shanghai has consistently been operating in that net positive contribution area as well. We'll see if I can remember all these in sequential order. So on updating guidance, we're in the process now of working through our long-term plan, just because of COVID and all the disruption to our business, it's a little bit delayed from a typical calendar schedule, but we are not going to update piecemeal, we're going to give you a full update of the guidance we provided at the original Investor Day when we do the upcoming Investor Day in a few months. So you can expect to hear a fulsome review of the guidance and what we're looking for now because obviously things have gone better than expected and we are growing into momentum here. On Japan, Disney+ launched on June 11 in Japan and it wasn't a full - I would call it a limited launch, it was an exclusive alliance with NTT DOCOMO, so that was not provide - you had to be an NTT DOCOMO subscriber in order to have that ability. So you shouldn't be looking that at a full country launch. So I think you can anticipate that once it is launched, there will be more demand for Disney+ in that market, because you're absolutely right, there is a very, very high affinity for the Disney brand in Japan. I think you also had a question on Fox synergies. We are still on track to achieve the synergies that we had discussed originally and that is going along. Even despite COVID, we're still proceeding Sure. In my prepared comments, I said that we would incur around $1 billion of costs between now and the end of fiscal '21 and that's a variety of things, it's everything from ramping up productions and you can imagine these productions, they have everything from distancing that you have to accommodate for, site preparation, stage preparation, all the testing that has to go on. So there's a lot of increased costs and what those also will result in is increased days to produce episodes. So all of those things will incur costs. As I mentioned, we will be capitalizing Many of those costs that are related to productions and those will be amortized in future periods. And also in parks, as you've heard from us, there is considerable costs that have been put in place to achieve safety and health measures and those largely are expensed in the parks. Hi, John. So let me just make a couple of comments on the dividend. As you know, management recommended and the Board decided to accept that recommendation not to pay dividend for the first half of fiscal '20 and that was the payment that would have been made in July and we all believe that that decision provided the company with additional financial flexibility given what we were seeing in the in the COVID environment we're in and all the uncertainty that we're dealing with and continue to deal with. So our Board would typically determine whether or not to declare a dividend for the second half of fiscal '20 in the latter part of the calendar year, it would be very late November, early December, and making the recommendation to the Board, we, again, were going to take into consideration. Where we are with COVID and the impact that it's having not only on our financial performance but what measures we are taking to mitigate COVID impacts. So we'll take the full financial picture into consideration and it is part of our overall capital allocation principles, but first and foremost, we are going to invest in businesses that we believe are going to drive long-term shareholder value, and you're seeing what we're doing in the direct-to-consumer initiatives, not only domestically with Disney+, internationally with Disney+ and now internationally with the General Entertainment channel. So we feel like that's certainly top of the list, but we are also looking at other measures like a dividend, but we won't make that decision or recommendation to the Board until the end of the close to the end of the calendar year. Sure. Thanks, Jason. You're right. We do take somewhat of a conservative approach to managing liquidity and when we raise that money, it was back in March and April, we were able to achieve some pretty favorable interest rates but we also did not have any visibility into how long this environment was going to continue. We also saw some weeks in the spring when they weren't consistent capital markets conditions. So you'd have some weeks when spreads gapped out, sometimes they tighten up and we took the position that get it when we can and because the demand was so high we decided to take it because we view it somewhat as an insurance policy. But when we look at the overall balance sheet, we have it and we see COVID continuing for a while, but one of the, there is a few things that have happened in our businesses. And one is just the way that we have probably been much better at cost mitigation than we anticipated. The whole company is aligned towards tightening the belt. And we've done, I think, a great job on that. But as we are opening up the parks, remember now, we furloughed over 100,000 people and we're bringing them back. For the most part, not all are back yet, but a lot are back. So we will be spending more money just in terms of labor than we did in the third quarter. So in the fourth quarter you'll see some of our costs actually go up to resume some of our businesses. So I look at this as, as we all know what kills the company is the lack of liquidity. And as a CFO, I would never want to be in that position of not being able to fund all of our obligations. No, if you look at that, that's out a couple of more years. So, and the other thing is we do have debt maturities coming up. We still have another about $1.1 billion this fiscal year. If my memory is correct. I think $3.5 billion for fiscal ' 21. So we've got some debt maturities that we don't have to go to market and if this cash is still on our balance sheet, we can just certainly repay that and not refinance. So that's a great question and I'm glad you asked that. So, I can put some color around this impairment. So, the best way I would frame it is this impairment reflects an underperformance of the international channels business that we are already seeing and then that was exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19. Coupled with that, we've learned a lot with the launch of Disney+ and we have, as you've heard today, accelerated our push into DTC consumer streaming and - with the same time you're seeing a decline in the subscriber on MVPD subscriber base outside of the U.S. So, you add all those things up and we're not - this impairment does not include the value of DTC, that's intact. What this impairment is about is the linear channels and so we have in this fiscal year, have already closed down more than 20 channels. Most of those were closed in this third quarter and they were primarily in APAC and in EMEA. Now, when I say APAC not in India, these are in other parts of Asia. But that's where the channels were closed and we're taking a look at going more quickly, as you said, into direct-to-consumer and these channels shutting them down and taking those platforms direct is certainly what is behind this impairment. Hi, Steve. So, when we were talking about the net positive contribution opening up Walt Disney World what we were referring to was that because there was a surge of COVID in Florida, which limited amount of inbound travel that we had originally anticipated. So, it's more local, that overall is having a little bit of a dampening effect on it, but it's still positive, and once again, it will pick up when there is more regular travel patterns going into Walt Disney World. And as it relates to sort of pricing and occupancy at the hotel, It's really like there are so many hotels that are not yet reopened. And so those are kind of meaningless numbers right now. So once I would say the travel patterns get a little more normalized and we see people going in and staying for regular vacations like they used to we'll be providing occupancy and booking numbers, but right now, the one thing I would add is per caps are very, very strong and you could say that that's probably because people haven't been in the parks for a while, there is a pent-up demand and let's not forget that we just opened the full - the rise of the resistance as well as the Star Wars Lands fully in the beginning of this calendar year. So, you had a lot of people and even Floridians who were just traveling locally who have not yet had an opportunity to go in and experience that. So, the per caps are great and I think it's because people haven't been able to get into our parks for quite a long time."

            "content": "Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone, I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. These continue to be challenging times for our world. The impact of the pandemic on people's lives, our communities, businesses and way of life has been devastating, and we remain deeply appreciative of the healthcare workers, researchers, community leaders and everyone doing their part to get us through this difficult period. Along with the challenges posed by the pandemic, the issues of racism and social injustice have also been front and center in ours and the nation's consciousness in recent months. We have been working closely with our employees and cast members in this critical area and have established six new strategic pillars to achieve greater diversity and inclusion across the company. We are committed to strongly advancing these initiatives as we strive towards greater representation and inclusion both in our workforce and creative content. As you know, the majority of businesses worldwide have experienced unprecedented disruption as a result of the pandemic. Most of our businesses were shut down and this had a huge impact on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.08 a share compared to $1.34 a share last year. Christine will talk more in depth about our results for the quarter. Despite the harsh realities we are facing today, we have made some encouraging progress. Since our last earnings call, we've begun a responsible phased reopening of our parks in Shanghai, Paris, Tokyo, and Orlando, as well as our shopping and dining area Downtown Disney in Anaheim. We have prioritized the health and safety of our cast members and guests and have instituted protocols that include a mandatory mask policy, temperature screenings, increased cleaning and disinfecting, as well as capacity restrictions to promote social distancing. We continue to work with national and local health and government officials in this very fluid situation and are making adjustments as necessary. Along with millions of fans, we're also pleased with the return of major live sports on ESPN including the successful resumption of the NBA and MLS seasons within the Walt Disney World bubble and restarts of the WNBA and MLB. Another positive development to note has been the initial restarting of some of our television and film productions, both domestically and overseas. When I became CEO in February, I emphasized that we will continue to pursue bold innovation thoughtful risk taking and the creative storytelling, that is the lifeblood of the Walt Disney Company, and despite the challenges of the pandemic, we've managed to take deliberate and innovative steps in running our businesses. At the same time, we've also been very focused on advancing and growing our direct-to-consumer business, which we see as our top priority and key to the future of our company. Last November, we successfully launched Disney+ domestically and we've since rolled it out in a number of major international markets, including Western Europe, India and Japan. I am also incredibly pleased to announce that, as of yesterday, we have surpassed 60.5 million paid subscribers globally, far exceeding our initial projections for the service. As our global sub numbers continue to grow, we've also exceeded our internal subscriber projections in every major market we've launched thus far. The tremendous success of Disney+ in less than a year clearly establishes us as a major force in the global direct-to-consumer space. We will continue our international expansion with the launch of Disney+ in the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September, and in Latin America this November. And I'm happy to announce that we will also be rolling out Disney+ Hotstar on September 5 in Indonesia, one of the world's most populous countries. By year-end, Disney+ will be available in nine of the top 10 economies in the world. When you look across our full portfolio of direct-to-consumer businesses, at Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, our combined global reach now exceeds an astounding 100 million paid subscriptions. This is a significant milestone and a reaffirmation of our strategy for growth. In fact, the incredible success we've achieved to date has made us even more confident about the future of our direct-to-consumer business and our ability to be more aggressive in our approach. Going forward, this confidence, coupled with the trends we're seeing in the multi-channel universe, will lead us to pursue even more innovative and bold initiatives as we continue to grow the business. I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you some of our upcoming plans and then we'll provide you more details at an investor presentation that we will host in the upcoming months. We've already demonstrated an aggressive approach to our content creation pipeline accelerating the Disney+ debuts of Frozen 2, Pixar's Onward and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, fast-tracking the debut of Broadway's Hamilton to Disney+, which has been a huge success. By combining the best elements of live theater, film and streaming, we have given millions of viewers a whole new way to experience this iconic cultural phenomenon. And last week, Beyonce's visual album, Black is King, premiered on Disney+, had critical acclaim, it's being widely celebrated for its diverse cast, stunning artistry and inspiring interpretation of the black experience. Both Hamilton and Black is King have clearly shown the power of the Disney+ platform for premiering world-class content. And there's more great content coming to the service. Highlights include Disney live actions, The One and Only Ivan, which will stream exclusively on the service beginning August 21 and the right stuff from National Geographic about NASA's Project Mercury which is set to premiere this fall. And millions of fans are anxiously awaiting the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian in October. The blockbuster series was just honored last week with an incredible 15 Emmy nominations including Outstanding Drama Series, a first for a debut streaming service. It also bears noting that the Walt Disney Company's television, cable, studio productions and streaming entities received an impressive 145 Primetime Emmy nominations, 92 were for programming content produced by our entities, which really speaks to the power of our creative engines across the company. As I said earlier, we've been able to begin resuming some of our creative pipeline activities amidst the pandemic and we're confident that when we can fully resume operations, we will be able to do so in a meaningful way with some of the best creative teams and most popular franchises in the industry. Like many companies, we've had to find innovative ways to conduct our business during the pandemic. While we view this as a devastating situation for everyone affected, it's also forced us to consider different approaches and look for new opportunities. In the process, we're discovering ways to better serve our consumers during this challenging period. Unfortunately, we've had to delay the release of Disney's highly anticipated tentpole film Mulan a number of times due to the impact of COVID on theaters. In order to meet the needs of consumers during this unpredictable period, we thought it was important to find alternative ways to bring this exceptional family-friendly film to them in a timely manner. We are announcing today that in most Disney+ markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a number of countries in Western Europe, we will be offering Disney+ subscribers the epic adventure Mulan on Disney+ on a premier access basis beginning September 4. The price point will be $29.99 in the U.S. and will vary slightly in other countries. Simultaneously, we will be releasing the film theatrically in certain markets where currently we have no announced launch plans for Disney+ and where theaters are open. We see this as an opportunity to bring this incredible film to a broad audience currently unable to go to movie theaters, while also further enhancing the value and attractiveness of a Disney+ subscription with this great content. Given the rapid changes in consumer behavior, we believe it is more important than ever that we continue to grow our direct relationship with our customers, and to this end, I am also pleased to announce that we plan to launch an international direct-to-consumer general entertainment offering under the Star brand in calendar year 2021. Mirroring the strategy we successfully pursued with Disney+, the offering will be rooted in content we own from the prolific and critically acclaimed production engines and libraries of ABC Studios, Fox Television, FX, Freeform, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight. In many markets, the offering will be fully integrated into our established Disney+ platform from both a marketing and a technology perspective, and it will be distributed under the Star brand which has been successfully utilized by the company for other general entertainment platform launches, particularly with Disney+ Hotstar in India. The fact that Disney+ is growing as rapidly as it has both domestically and globally, clearly demonstrates the value of our content, and through the addition of our Star-branded general entertainment offering, we were further extending the value of that content internationally. Let me reiterate that we see tremendous opportunity in the direct-to-consumer space, and in the light of the success that we've achieved thus far with our global direct-to-consumer business and bolstered by our ability to deliver the exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling their consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for, we intend to take full advantage of that opportunity. To this end, as I mentioned, we will be hosting another Investor Day in the coming months, focused on our plans to accelerate the push into the direct-to-consumer marketplace across our Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and Star brands. Personally, I am as optimistic as I could be about our way forward and I'm excited to share more about our plans with you in the coming months. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine. We are very pleased to be able to bring Mulan to our consumer base has been waiting for it for a long, long time as we've had to unfortunately move our theatrical dates several times. We are fortunate that we have the opportunity to bring it to our own direct-to-consumer platforms. So consumers can enjoy it. But we're looking at Mulan as a one-off in terms of, as opposed to say trying to say that there is some new business window we model that we're looking at. So Mulan is a one-off. That said, we find it very interesting to be able to take a new offering, our premier access offering to consumers at that $29.99 price and learn from it and see what happens not only in terms of the uptake of the number of subscribers that we get on the platform, but the actual number of transactions on the Disney+ platform that we get on that PVOD offering. Yes, this is obviously a highly uncertain time and we could tell from our reservation stream that we had ample demand to go above what the six-foot social distancing guidelines would give us, that was six weeks before we opened the park when we announced we were opening the park and then unfortunately COVID struck again and all the numbers started going up. This gave some level of trepidation to travelers who are anxious about long distance travel, jumping on a plane and flying to Walt Disney World. So what we've seen is that we have roughly 50% of our guest base still traveling from a distance, but the other 50% coming from local markets and in state. We've also had a higher-than-expected level of cancellations once somebody does make a reservation because as the disease ebbs and flows, they might necessarily cancel. So what we've done is used our strategy for yielding and make sure that every day we're pretty close to the percentage of the park that we can fill and still maintain the social distancing, we just replaced local and annual pass holders with some of the fall-off that we've necessarily seen from the long distance travelers. I will say that our research indicates that - and our bookings indicate that we should be in good shape once consumer confidence sort of returns, and so we're very optimistic about that, but we're very happy that we're returning a positive net contribution, as Christine said, because that was our goal in the first place, while at the same time, operating very responsibly. In terms of the general entertainment offering internationally, we want to mirror successful Disney+ strategy by using our Disney+ technical platform, rooting it in content that we already own and distributing it under a successful international brand that we also already own which is of course Star and then bringing it to market in a very close association to Disney. I think in terms of your being surprised that this isn't being launched under a different brand name, I think it's important to look at the differences in how we have plan on going into the market, and the first thing is that Hulu aggregates third-party content where this will not. This will be rooted in our own content from ABC studios, Fox TV, FX, Freeform, Searchlight, and 20th century, and Hulu also, I must say has no brand awareness outside of the U.S. and nor does Hulu have any content that's been licensed to it internationally. So this gives us the ability to market this under the Disney umbrella and have synergies with our existing platform. So that's our basic rationale there. In terms of the premier access idea, as you probably know, Disney tentpole blockbuster theatrical films can be fairly expensive to make and produce in order to get the quality that consumers expect from us and frankly to get the quality that we expect from us, and rather than simply rolling it into a free offering, we thought we would give again because we can test almost anything when you have your own platform, we thought we would give it a try to establish a new window - a premier access window to try to recapture some of that investment that we've got and the good news, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is that we're going to have a chance to learn from this and to see whether that makes sense. All I'll say about our research is that it shows that such an offering under a premier access offering not only gets us revenue from the original transaction from the PVOD but also acts as a fairly large stimulus to sign up for Disney+. As you may suspect, while we've had to slow down production and cease it altogether In some cases during the COVID time, we've been busy developing new content and we're extremely excited about some of the things that we've got not only to sustain that linear growth that you talked about for Disney+ but actually go beyond that and grow it. We've got, of course, The Mandalorian 2 which we've announced is coming in October. But we've also got a slew of Marvel content that's going to be coming that we're very excited about and these require us to re-enter into production, but it's such a priority that we're hopeful that this will be coming shortly to enable us to again not only sustain but continue to grow and I would tell you that the content is fabulous, Loki, Falcon and Winter Soldier and Wandavision 3, Marvel properties that we're really, really excited about. And one of the things about Disney+ that we found is that new content tends to bring in new subscribers by catalog increases engagement and helps us retain subscribers. So I think that this new content having so much of this all at once that I think it's really going to go ahead and propel the business forward. Christine? Yes, in terms of the Star offering that we announced today, we see this as part of a sort of a sequential Domino strategy in terms of getting towards an offering on Disney+ starting with the PVOD going through some transactional window after we have an exclusive on Disney+ for the PVOD details to be announced later and then eventually going to Disney+ will live in perpetuity. Now, I should also say that we think that the Star brand itself in terms of its offerings, we've got a utility here, we've got a utility that is enabled on obviously platforms. I did mention to you that we will have the ability to use the same platform across both Disney+ and Star, so that if theoretically we can afford to do something on one particular platform like Disney+ we should be able to do it on a Star platform. It's not something we've talked about or entertained, but the capability is there. In terms of the Fox - in terms of the college football and the likelihood that in place, I don't really want to comment on the possibility of us going on the season going on because I think that's really up to the League Commissioners, that being said, we feel that we've got certain covenants that we have to meet in terms of live permitting hours with our partners, and we feel confident that with the way that we see all of the sports going on right now, we feel confident that we're going to be able to reach that. Yes, well, we have no planned AVOD/SVOD on Star itself, but we've got obviously similar capabilities as we've got to Disney+ if we ever so chose to do that, but we've got no plans to do that now. And in terms of the ESPN question, let me first start off by saying that on a macro level, I think we understand the value of live sports, ESPN is a strongest brand in sports and sports continue to be a driver of viewing interest. I think it's evidenced by the fact that sports accounted for over 90 of the 100 most viewed telecasts on broadcast and cable in 2019. So, we've got a really strong position from a brand standpoint in a market that consumers love. So, then the question is, how do we get it to the consumer and certainly U.S. that whether we've looked at a stronger direct-to-consumer proposition for ESPN? Absolutely, we've looked at everything and when we think that we've got the most effective way to maximize shareholder value from the brand, the way we are right now, but as that changes over time, we're certainly open to any and all options in terms of how we maybe able to get our programs to our consumers and hopefully we can talk a little bit more about this in our investor conference when we meet in the next few months. I'll follow up on the parks question is that, as you know, different guests depending on where they're coming from have different relative values in terms of their contribution as a guest to the park and typically someone who travels and stays for five days to seven days is marginally more valuable to the business than someone who comes in on an annual pass and stays a day or two and consumes less merchandise and food and beverage. So, the way I would look at it is that it's just as their constituency changes a little bit, so do our overall margins change, but it's not because of price reductions or anything like that. And I think Christine handled the pricing and occupancy in hotels. On the Disney+ we absolutely are going after a bigger market of the number of subscribers as opposed to over rotating to try to get to a profitability number much sooner than we thought. Although I must say the prospect of us hitting our goals as quickly as we are is very encouraging, but what we plan to do is invest even more in our content in order to keep that machine cranked and going. As I mentioned, one of the biggest things in terms of subscriber acquisition is having new hot [indiscernible] content to bring to the service and you get that by making investments in new content. So, we'll be investing in content first and then trying to grow the service both from a marketing standpoint and from an installed base standpoint."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon and welcome to The Walt Disney Company\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is also being webcast and the webcast and a transcript will also be available on our website. We hope you are all staying home and we realized that most of you are joining us today from your homes. And given Los Angeles County\u2019s Safer at Home order, we are hosting today\u2019s call remotely. So joining me from their homes are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s Chairman; Bob Chapek, Disney\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob Iger, Bob Chapek and Christine, we will be happy to take some questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob Iger to get started.\nBob Iger: Thanks, Lowell and good afternoon, everyone. Obviously, much has changed in the world since our last earnings call and the challenges we are now facing are unprecedented. Like so many other companies and industries, the pandemic has hit us hard and both Bob and Christine will walk you through the specifics. However, as someone who has been around for awhile and let this company through some really tough days over the last 15 years, including economic downturns, natural disasters and other unforeseen events, I have absolute confidence in our ability to get through this challenging period and recover successfully. The Walt Disney Company has demonstrated repeatedly over its nearly 100-year history that it is exceptionally resilient. And I believe this time will be no different. We entered this crisis with a strong hand and an exceptional management team now led by Bob Chapek. And as we said in February, when Bob was announced as CEO, he and I continue to work in partnership in support of the company\u2019s objectives and to ensure a smooth and successful transition. As you would expect when dealing with a challenge of this magnitude, the entire team is working closely together taking an all hands on deck approach to address the difficult issues we are facing. Of course, one key to our resilience is the strength of our brands and the strong emotional connection people have to them: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ABC, ESPN and Star Wars. In fact, recent studies have shown we have maintained that connection with consumers throughout this crisis. We also have a tremendous collection of assets. And beyond that, what we create has never been more necessary or more important than right now. In fact, it\u2019s quite possible that what we create is appreciated now more than ever, because people find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism. This is the same reason we believe people will resume familiar activities once this crisis ends. They missed doing the things they enjoy things that make them feel happy and connected with family and friends, whether it\u2019s going to movie theaters to see our films or visiting our theme parks around the world or watching live sports on ESPN. People want good news. They want to experience joy and the feeling of togetherness. And for all these reasons, we will continue to tell stories that uplift and enrich people\u2019s lives. While much of our operations are shutdown, we have been fortunate to keep parts of our creative pipeline active, including a number of writing and development projects, while also continuing postproduction work from media networks, our studios and Disney+. And I have been working with our creative teams across the company and I am extremely excited about what\u2019s in store. I have no doubt that we will get through this, but it will take some time. Before I turn it over to Bob and Christine to talk about the quarter and the strategy going forward and to answer your questions, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for all of the medical professionals across our country who are fighting valiantly to save lives and to everyone helping to flatten the curve by heeding the advice of health officials and others, it\u2019s all making a difference. On behalf of Bob and myself, I also want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees around the world who continue to show incredible ingenuity, commitment, patience and understanding during these trying times. Even in the face of adversity, their dedication to our company and our mission is unwavering and we couldn\u2019t be more proud of them. And with that, I will hand it over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon everyone. I hope you are all doing well and staying safe. When I stepped into this new job, 2.5 months ago, none of us could have imagined the suffering and sacrifice that we are now seeing around the world. This devastating pandemic is like nothing most of us have ever experienced in our lifetime. This had a profound impact on millions of lives, physically, psychologically, financially causing tremendous hardship and loss. And just about everyone has been affected in one way or another either personally or through someone they know a friend, family member neighbor, or colleague. Fortunately, amidst the adversity, we see the best of humanity demonstrated through inspiring acts of compassion and selflessness from the courageous healthcare workers caring for people on the frontlines in hospitals across the country, to our first responders and others providing essential services throughout our communities. We are grateful for and deeply appreciative of their efforts. Here at Disney, as Bob mentioned, we are also grateful to our own employees, starting with our local and national ABC News teams providing critical and factual information around the clock; our ESPN team providing compelling programming in the absence of live sports, our global security personnel and key staff who are safeguarding and maintaining our parks and resorts, they are doing a phenomenal job and we could not be more proud of them. As you know, Disney, like many other companies, has experienced widespread disruption. In mid-March, we have closed our domestic parks and hotels indefinitely, suspended our cruise line, halted film and TV productions and shuttered our retail stores. And while these were necessary steps to ensure the safety and well-being of our guest and employees, our businesses have been hugely impacted. In the second fiscal quarter, adjusted EPS fell to $0.60 a share from $1.61 a year earlier primarily due to the suspended operations I just outlined. Christine will talk more in depth about our results for the quarter and the ongoing financial impact of COVID-19. Before she does, I want to share a few thoughts on the destruction we are seeing across our company as well as our confidence and our ability to weather the storm. While it\u2019s too early to predict when we will be able to begin resuming all of our operations, we are evaluating a number of different scenarios to ensure a cautious, sensible and deliberate approach to the eventual reopening of our parks. As you know, our parks have been closed around the world, Shanghai and Hong Kong since January, Tokyo since February, and our U.S. and Paris parks since mid-March. The approach we take may include implementation of guest capacity and density control measures as well as health and prevention procedures that comply with state and federal guidelines. We are seeing encouraging signs of a gradual return to some semblance of normalcy in China. And in light of the lifting of certain restrictions in recent weeks and the successful reopening of our park adjacent retail and food and beverage area, Disneytown, we and our government partners, Shanghai Shendi Group, plan to open Shanghai Disneyland on May 11. We will take a phased approach with limits on attendance using an advanced reservation and entry system, controlled guest density using social distancing and strict government required health and prevention procedures. These include the use of masks, temperature screenings and other contact tracing and early detection systems. Moving to Media Networks, ESPN has truly stepped up in the absence of live sports finding new and innovative ways to deliver compelling content that fans want. This included releasing, 2 months early, the highly anticipated 10-part docuseries on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, The Last Dance. The series, which continues through May 17, is the most viewed ESPN documentary ever and currently ranks as the number one program in America, amongst all key male demos since sports halted. ESPN also took what has historically been an engaging life event and turn into a virtual one with the NFL draft. This resulted in the bigger audience than ever before with a record 55 million plus viewers over the 3-day event. The draft was a particularly impressive technological feet driven by more than 600 remote camera feeds from homes across the U.S. When you look at the impact of these two events, ESPN\u2019s April prime-time audience, was up 11% versus last year among adults 18 to 49. In fact, it tanked as the top cable network among this key demographic. Going forward, ESPN is going to be rolling out three new films as part of its award winning 30 for 30 series. We are also going to air virtual 2020 ESPYs on June 21. Additionally, ESPN will be bringing back several more of its marquee studio programs beginning in the week of May 11. This will expand their live and quick turnaround studio programming to 11 straight hours each weekday. Sports will come back strong. And when they do, we believe ESPN is best positioned to benefit with more offerings than anyone else. And if it\u2019s a gradual process, where sports return for a period without spectators in the stance, we can count on ESPN to bring the same level of innovations that we saw with the NFL draft and continue to deliver our great experience for sports fans. On the studio side, we are incredibly excited about our upcoming slate of films. However, with theatres closed and our production shutdown due to COVID-19, we have had to reschedule a number of release dates for tentpole movies. These include Disney\u2019s Mulan for July 24, Marvel\u2019s Black Widow for November 6, Pixar\u2019s Soul on November 20, and 20th Century\u2019s Free Guy set for December 11. As many of your already know, Artemis Fowl, originally slated for a theatrical run, will debut exclusively in Disney+ starting on June 12. As we have said, our company\u2019s top priority and our key to our growth is our direct-to-consumer business. And I am pleased to say that the response to Disney+ in particular has exceeded even our highest expectations. We have been thrilled with the performance of the service since our initial launch in November and we continue to expand into other markets. In late March, as planned and despite COVID-19, we had an incredibly successful launch of Disney+ in Western Europe, followed by a highly successful launch in India. We announced in early April that in just 5 months we have surpassed 50 million subscribers globally, a significant milestone for us. We have been quite pleased with the growth that we have seen in the 4 weeks since then and there is more to come. Disney+ will begin rolling out in Japan in June, followed by the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September and Latin America will follow towards the end of the year. This robust collection of library and original content available on Disney+ continues to grow, including with Disney\u2019s Frozen 2 and Pixar\u2019s Onward, which were released early as a special offering for families as a shelter at home. Yesterday\u2019s SVOD premier of Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker and the new behind the scenes documentary about the making of one of Disney+\u2019s most successful series, The Mandalorian, along with the fall premier of National Geographic\u2019s original series, The Right Stuff, based on the book by Tom Wolfe about NASA\u2019s Project Mercury. This quarter, Hulu saw the successful launch of FX on Hulu. Nearly, 45% of Hulu subscribers have accessed library, current and original content from the FX network on the service. Also, Hulu\u2019s strong original series continue to perform extremely well as evidenced by the critically acclaimed hit series, Little Fires Everywhere, amongst others. Hulu had 32 million total subscribers at the end of Q2. We are enormously proud of what we have accomplished to-date and we are optimistic for the future. As I said earlier, our businesses have experienced considerable disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This forced us to implement a variety of measures to manage the short and long-term financial impact on our company. The first was a substantial reduction in senior executive compensation company-wide, which will remain in effect until we see a substantive economic recovery. We were fortunate for the first 5 weeks to be able to pay full salaries to those employees who were unable to perform their duties. However, with no way to predict when this crisis will end, we made the very difficult decision to begin the furloughs on April 19. Unlike layoffs, the furlough process allows impacted workers to remain as Disney employees, while continuing to receive their full healthcare benefits paid for by the company. We are fully committed to getting our employees back to work as quickly as the current situation allows. While these were not easy decisions, I do believe they have been the right ones given the unprecedented challenges that we are faced with. Now, before I turn it over to Christine, let me just reiterate what Bob said and that is Disney is an exceptionally resilient company. With a great management team and thousands of talented and dedicated employees, we continue to deliver exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling that consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for and we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position. With that, I will turn it over to Christine to talk more about the quarter and then we will be happy to answer your questions.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. These are truly unprecedented times and the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our company in a number of significant ways. From a financial standpoint, we estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19 related disruption on our second quarter operating income with as much as $1.4 billion, with the majority of that impact at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. As a result, excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $0.60. Bob Chapek highlighted a number of steps we have already taken to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our financial performance. We have also been very focused on strengthening our liquidity position to ensure we have adequate resources to fund our operations during this crisis. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. Those who have followed the company over the years know that we have historically taken a prudent approach to managing our balance sheet and liquidity. So despite the current business challenges, we believe we start from a position of relative strength. We took proactive and decisive steps during the quarter to further enhance our liquidity position by issuing $6 billion of term debt, which contributed to a cash and cash equivalents balance of $14.3 billion to end the quarter. And a week after the quarter ended, we issued another $925 million in term debt. Last month, we closed on a new $5 billion 364-day bank facility, which combined with our existing credit facilities of $12.25 billion, provides us with total credit facility capacity of $17.25 billion. I will note that the $12.25 credit facilities also serve to backstop our commercial paper program. We are evaluating a wide range of scenarios with respect to the potential ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses, while prudently managing cash outflows. And overall, we feel confident in our ability to manage through the crisis. We continue to actively evaluate additional mitigation strategies to position our company to emerge from this crisis with the financial flexibility necessary to get back on a growth path. From a cash flow standpoint, the Board has made the decision to forego payment of a semi-annual dividend for the first half of the fiscal year, which would have been payable in July. This preserves about $1.6 billion in cash assuming we had held the dividend constant at $0.88 per share. We also identified opportunities to reduce our capital spending and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be about $900 million lower than our prior guidance, or $400 million below prior year, driven primarily by paused construction and refurbishment work due to the temporary closing of our parks. While it is still too early to consider more specific implications for capital spending in fiscal 2021, we remain confident in our investment decisions and the resiliency of our businesses. Prior to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic with the exception of Hong Kong Disneyland, the rest of our parks and experiences businesses were trending well ahead of prior year. As we had previously disclosed, Hong Kong Disneyland faced challenges due to significant declines in visitation from China and other parts of Asia. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 11% in the second quarter. I\u2019ll remind you that the Disneyland Resort closed on March 14 and Walt Disney World closed March 16. We estimate the closure of our domestic parks had an adverse impact on attendance growth of approximately 18 percentage points. Per capita guest spending during the period the parks were open was up 13% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% and occupancy was down 16 points to 77%, which reflects a 13% decline in occupied room nights. We estimate the closure of our domestic hotels had an adverse impact on occupied room nights of approximately 15 points. As a result of the unprecedented disruptions to our businesses, Q2 operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products was significantly lower compared to Q2 last year. We estimate the disruption to our Parks, Experiences and Products businesses adversely impacted Q2 operating income by approximately $1 billion. As we look ahead, while we\u2019ve announced plans to reopen Shanghai Disney Resort, there is limited visibility into the timing of reopening and the conditions under which we can reopen the rest of our parks and resorts, cruise ships and Disney stores. However, we believe the strength of our brands and our unwavering commitment to the guest experience are valuable assets that will serve us and our guests well once we reopen. At Studio Entertainment, operating income was lower in the quarter as higher TV/SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio were more than offset by higher film impairments, lower worldwide theatrical distribution results at our legacy film studio and a decline in our stage play business due to the impact of COVID-19. Worldwide theatrical results in the quarter were adversely impacted by higher bad debt reserves for receivables due from exhibitors and by lower revenue due to the closure of theaters around the world. In aggregate, the performance of key titles in the quarter, which included Frozen 2, Star Wars, The Rise of Skywalker and Onward was comparable to key theatrical titles in Q2 last year, which included Captain Marvel, Mary Poppins Returns and Dumbo. We feel the performance of Onward was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic given its release date relative to when theaters began to close. Higher legacy TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Aladdin, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. The 21CF studio business was a positive contributor in the quarter as higher operating income from TV/SVOD distribution more than offset an operating loss at worldwide theatrical and general and administrative costs. Turning to Media Networks, operating income was up in the second quarter due to higher results at broadcasting as cable operating income was roughly comparable to Q2 last year. At Broadcasting the increase in operating income was due to the consolidation of 21CF, largely reflecting program sales and to a lesser extent an increase in our legacy broadcasting operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to higher affiliate revenue and lower programming and production costs, partially offset by lower program sales from ABC Studios and higher network marketing costs. The decrease in network programming and production costs was due to a timing benefit from new accounting guidance, partially offset by more hours of higher cost specials and a contractual rate increase for the Academy Awards in the current quarter. More detail on the new accounting guidance is contained in the 10-Q filing. But I\u2019ll note that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expense during the first half of the fiscal year, we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. Lower ABC Studios program sales reflect the prior year sale of Jessica Jones and How to Get Away with Murder in Q2 last year. Total broadcasting ad revenue was 3% higher in the quarter driven by consolidation of 21CF and higher political advertising at our owned stations. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to Q2 last year. Cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, largely offset by a decrease at ESPN where growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs and lower advertising revenue. Higher programming and production costs at ESPN were primarily driven by contractual rate increases for the College Football Playoffs and college basketball and costs associated with the launch of the ACC Network. Total ESPN advertising revenue was down approximately 8% in the second quarter as higher rates were more than offset by lower average viewership. Total viewership was negatively impacted by the cancellation of live sporting events in the latter part of the quarter, primarily NBA and college basketball championship week. So far this quarter ESPN\u2019s domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing significantly below this time last year, reflecting the current challenges in the marketplace due to the lack of live sports inventory coupled with limited advertiser demand. However, we have seen a couple of bright spots so far this quarter with record viewership for the first six episodes of The Last Dance, our highest-rated original documentary of all time. Additionally, the NFL Draft, was the most watched ever, reaching more than 55 million viewers over the three-day event and average audience growth of 58% on ESPN versus last year. The performance of these two events suggests there is meaningful pent-up demand from fans for compelling sports programming and ESPN continues to be well positioned to capitalize on this demand. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 16% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 13 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 3 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which benefited by about 2.5 points due to the launch of the ACC Network. At our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment operating losses were $427 million higher in the quarter driven by costs incurred to support the ongoing launch of Disney+ around the world and the consolidation of Hulu. Disney+ launched in a number of European markets during the quarter, which contributed to a total paid subscriber base of $33.5 million at the end of the quarter. And we are very pleased with the success of our rollout in Western Europe and India, including the execution of previously announced deals with some European platforms to distribute the service to all paid subscribers on certain of the widely distributed tiers and in India to convert our pre-existing subscription based Hotstar service to Disney+ Hotstar. As we announced on April 8, during the third quarter, we exceeded 15 million Disney+ paid subscribers. More information about those launches is available in our Form 10-Q. Because we executed a number of launches between quarter-end and today, we have decided to bring these numbers current. As of May 4th, we estimate we had approximately 54.5 million Disney+ subscribers reflecting a subscriber mix generally similar to our mix at April 8. Segment results also reflect the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu and a benefit from the consolidation of the 21CF international cable businesses. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $500 million, which came in a little better than the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our direct-to-consumer and international segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the third quarter and we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, in particular, Disney+ to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $420 million. Revenue eliminations increased $1.2 billion and profit eliminations increased $211 million compared to Q2 last year driven primarily by higher intersegment content sales from studio and media networks to DTCI. And finally, the 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF\u2019s stake in Hulu and net of inter-segment eliminations, contributed approximately $460 million in segment operating income in the second quarter. Consolidating Hulu\u2019s operating losses and netting out inter-segment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $200 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu, had a dilutive impact on our Q2 EPS before purchase accounting, although it was less dilutive than we expected. This is obviously a very fluid situation and given the lack of visibility around when some businesses will reopen fully or partially and the conditions under which they reopen, we don\u2019t intend to provide specific guidance around our expectations for the remainder of the year. These are uncertain times and our people and businesses are being impacted in significant ways. Despite these near-term challenges, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our company. And with that, I will turn the call over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Christine. As we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I am going to do my best to moderate by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that, operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. I will ask two questions. The first on the parks completely understand the lack of visibility, but is there anyway you can help us think about sort of the cash burn on that business assuming you are close through this quarter or even a monthly number, just some way to kind of dimensionalize the impact on the income statement as you move through this unprecedented situation on the parks would be very helpful? And then I was curious you guys are \u2013 you are probably going to be approaching the low end of your 2024 guidance on direct-to-consumer subscribers potentially by the end of this quarter based on the growth you are seeing, but certainly over the next couple of quarters. Given that faster ramp and what\u2019s happening with people staying at home and streaming more, I am just wondering if that\u2019s impacting your plans around investing in the business or \u2013 and if you think you will reach profitability sooner than originally laid out? Thanks. Thanks for your thoughts.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Ben. Thanks. I am going to turn those over to Christine to answer the first and start with the second.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Hi, Ben. How are you? Hope you are doing well and your family as well.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Let me answer the question on parks as best I can. As you know we are dealing with a situation that\u2019s very fluid and things are changing. So, the results that you saw for the second quarter reflect approximately 2ish weeks of our domestic parks being closed, because we closed Disneyland on the 14th and World on the 16. And then you had the Asian parks closed, Shanghai closed fully in January on the 25, Hong Kong closed on the 26, Tokyo, which is a royalty revenue stream that we get, that closed on the 29. So the $1 billion that was attributable to the parks business and products for the quarter just for that second quarter about $1 billion, you could roughly think of it that the two weeks domestic is a little over half. And then you have the Asian \u2013 or the international parks and cruise, which are the balance. So when you think about Hong Kong we already had issues that related to their own domestic issues. So we had already telegraphed that there would be some softness in Hong Kong and then this closure of the park just accelerated the losses there. And Shanghai had been doing quite well up until the moment that we are closed. And I am going to ask Bob Chapek if he has any other thoughts that he would like to add to that.\nBob Chapek: No, it\u2019s just that we were doing everything we can to mitigate the impact of the cash burn while we are obviously in this situation and we are trying to be as responsible as possible, both short term in terms of operating expenses and labor but also longer term in terms of how we allocate capital.\nLowell Singer: Okay. And Bob, do you want to start on the second question around Disney+ and then Christine if you want to add anything, feel free.\nBob Chapek: Sure. We are obviously thrilled with the progress of Disney+ and how we\u2019ve been able to increase the base there. We\u2019re not really prepared to update our guidance and certainly wouldn\u2019t give any projections in terms of when we would reach profitability. But we know that in terms of the actual investment in Disney+ that new programming, hit new programming like the Mandalorian certainly drives that business. And so I think we\u2019ll continue to make the planned investments into Disney+ as we always have with new and exciting programming to drive those subscription rates and retention.\nChristine McCarthy: And, Ben, I would just add that we are still launching in new markets. So while we have had a really good start to Disney+ we still think it\u2019s early and we\u2019ll update when it\u2019s appropriate.\nBen Swinburne: Okay. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Ben, thank you. Operator, net question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you very much. I hope everybody is safe and well. Just two quick questions, one follow-up and then a second question. Just following up on your comments on the parks, I wonder if you could tell us or just speak generally about what capacity you guys can operate at the park profitably and resume obviously when you do open, which I know is very fluid and we can\u2019t pinpoint that right now in terms of domestic opening, just trying to get a sense of what sort of capacity you think could still sort of get you to breakeven or profitability? And then my second question is just on the studio side of the business. We are on in one of the first tentpole movies scheduled to be released late July and I guess are you comfortable with opening that movies in what will most likely be minimal capacity at the theaters? I guess overall, how much of a consideration is also the international theater openings in your decision to begin to start releasing films in this climate?\nLowell Singer: Alright. Alexia, thanks for the questions. Bob Chapek, I\u2019ll turn that over to you.\nBob Chapek: Alright. Hello, Alexia in terms of how we look at our park reopening and what hurdle we need to make to have it make sense, we actually look at it as a positive net contribution to overhead and profit. Another word, it\u2019s not about break-even point for profitability necessarily, but just making a positive contribution at the net contribution level. So what we are thinking is that while every site is completely different, that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re going to take. And frankly we would not reopen any park unless we can make at least a positive contribution to that overhead and operating profit level. In terms of the second question in terms of the studio and what type of audiences will Mulan see it when it opens up? We\u2019re going to get a pretty good idea of that because there is a competitive movie that opens up one week before our film does. And at that point we\u2019re hoping that there is some return to semblance of normal, in terms of number of screens that are opening in a number of showtimes for those movies. So our fingers are crossed. Obviously, that\u2019s our first big move of the gate. But again between some balance of limited number of seats in theaters as social distancing practiced by the exhibitors combined with what\u2019s got to be an incredible pent-up demand. I think, we will shortly find out and maybe we\u2019ll find out the week before was a competitive movie.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Alexia, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Two questions as well and a clarification. Following along the lines of Ben\u2019s question, given the crisis has accelerated the shift toward streaming around the world, any change in your plan to pursue Hulu international launches next year? I could understand reasons to accelerate. I could understand that \u2013 the potential sort of costs of launching Hulu could also have you considering delaying that. On the film side, when do you think large-scale productions like Marvel films can start back up in terms of principal photography? And any comments on windows? There\u2019s a lot of buzz these days on launching new premium VOD window to try to replace some of the theatrical revenue that might be lost. The quick clarification, the Shanghai reopening, the masks are just for employees or for employees and for guests? Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Doug. Thanks. I\u2019m going to turn those over to Bob Chapek.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of our interest in Hulu internationally, given everything that\u2019s happening, you said you can make an argument either away, frankly we, long-term, are still bullish about Hulu international. Right now though, given the cash situation and the sort of uncertainty around our overall business, we\u2019ve got no plans immediately to make any investment in that business internationally. But that again is short term only because of the COVID situation that we\u2019re sort of faced with. And the second question was again?\nLowell Singer: Production \u2013 large-scale production and then window.\nBob Chapek: Oh, large-scale production and when will it \u2013 yes. In terms of large-scale production, we\u2019re going to go through the same process with our productions as we do our theme parks in terms of absolutely guaranteeing that we\u2019re going to be responsible in terms of how we put both our own employees and other filmmakers that are partners with us as they do these productions. So we\u2019ve got no projections of exactly when we can do that, but we will be very responsible in terms of mask and the same type of procedures that we would hope to implement into our parks when we sort of proceed. And the third question?\nDoug Mitchelson: Any thoughts on premium VOD window to try to offset any of the sort of implications around restricted \u2013 restrictions at the theatrical in the coming months?\nBob Chapek: Yes. So we very much believe in the value of the theatrical experience overall to launch blockbuster movies. As you know, we had 7 $1 billion films in calendar year \u201819. But we also realize that either because of changing and evolving consumer dynamics or because of certain situations like COVID, we may have to make some changes to that overall strategy just because theaters aren\u2019t open or aren\u2019t open to the extent that anybody needs to be financially viable. So we\u2019re going to evaluate each one of our movies on a case-by-case situation as we are doing right now during this coronavirus situation. I think you know that Artemis Fowl is moving over to Disney+ given the demographics of appeal of that film, which was not originally the plan. And \u2013 but all our other Temple movies have been rescheduled theatrically for later in the year. So we very much believe in the power of that launch platform for our big movies.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you very much. And then just lastly masks for guests and or employees in Shanghai?\nBob Chapek: Yes, in terms of Shanghai it\u2019s going to be masks for guests and employees. The only characters that will not wear masks are the face characters and they\u2019ll be at a distance from crowds.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you all.\nLowell Singer: Doug, thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Hi, thank you. Hope everybody is okay. Two questions. One\u2026\nLowell Singer: Jessica, you could speak up a little bit, please.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Sure. The first question is how are you thinking about longer-term changes in your business model as a result of this crisis? And however you think about that whether it\u2019s sports, how much you will bid or how many contracts you need or conversely is this an opportunity versus competitors, CapEx, resizing the business etcetera? And second question is can you remind us what percent pre-crisis cruise ships were in terms of revenue and operating income? And since this seems like the last business that will come back, can you cancel the orders for your pending ships that are being built?\nLowell Singer: Okay. So I\u2019ll turn the business model question over to Bob Chapek. And then I think he and Christine can address the cruise question.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the future rides and the business models, we think that live sports remain incredibly valuable to us and we continue to have an interest in live sports rights given the unique slate of assets that we own with ESPN, ESPN+ and ABC. And we\u2019re going to do that, though, as we always have done in a very disciplined manner. Existing consumer trends play a real big part on how we think about the value of sports rights as they make the transition from linear over to digital. And I think it really \u2013 it\u2019s a bit premature to give any specific details on what the strategy is other than we\u2019re obviously highly interested in those and we think we want to make the evolution along with the consumer as they go from linear to digital. In terms of the CapEx question, obviously we had a lot of really big plans in the parks and we still continue to have big plans. Those good ideas before COVID are going to be really good ideas after. And as Christine said in her opening remarks, there are certain trimmings that we\u2019re doing here and there to be responsible from a financial standpoint, but we have such great intellectual property and our Imagineers over at our theme over at our theme parks where the majority of our capital goes have done such a tremendous job of planning out future experiences for our guests that we\u2019re just going to go ahead and take a slightly finer-tooth comb, if you will, through those expenditures but essentially plan on investing behind those businesses like we always have. And in terms of the cruise ship business, we agree that that will probably be the last of our travel oriented businesses to come back online. Interestingly enough long term all of our data and our research shows that our guests will be just as interested in cruising with us long term. Obviously not in the next few months but much more resilient than any of the competitive businesses because of that love for Disney and assurance that they feel, that they trust our business to act in a responsible way to help to the extent possible protect them against some of the woes that have plagued the industry since COVID has hit.\nLowell Singer: Christine, do you want to just talk about the cruise component of that segment?\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. Jessica we don\u2019t break down our individual businesses within the segment, but \u2013 so for the percent of revenue and operating income, given the size of our global parks business that includes the cruise business and now it includes consumer products. It\u2019s a relatively small percentage of operating income and revenue. But that being said and this just builds on some of the things Bob said, this is a business that is one of our highest rated businesses in terms of guest satisfaction and it also has a very high intent to repeat the experience. So a lot of people who go on one tend to go back for multiple cruises. So \u2013 and it\u2019s also a business when we look at it from an ROI perspective, ROIC perspective, it\u2019s a very nice returning business creating value long term for shareholders.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Jessica thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I have two. One is, I wonder, for Bob Chapek. How do you staff the parks in anticipation of an opening? What signals do you look for and what drives your optimization? Is it the number of basically the experience you want to have measure up to a park at full opening? So any type of signals, any type of history you have to staff up in anticipation of an opening. That\u2019s one. And then two for Christine, in answering Ben\u2019s question you were helpful in giving us the impact from COVID, but then you guys furloughed employees in April. So how would that answer change furloughed employee world. So how much of the cost base becomes variable post the furloughs? So those are my questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thank you for the questions. Bob Chapek, do you want to start with the first one?\nBob Chapek: Yes, in terms of the signals we look for park opening, our hypothesis is because of pent-up demand that if we open up at something less than 50% of our standard capacity that we\u2019re probably not going to have trouble filling that. So whatever level we save that at , whether it\u2019s 10%, 25% or 50% of typical crowds, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be able to have at our park. Therefore we will staff accordingly to that type of level, whatever that level will be eventually. In terms of optimization and sort of how we\u2019ll approach that, obviously labor is a huge component of our cost base and so that will slide with the attendance. And that\u2019s why I said when we\u2019re looking at the decisions for what that level would be inside the parks and what we\u2019re going to be targeting for, it\u2019s really looked at as a contribution to net contribution and profit as opposed to saying that we\u2019re going to sort of cover the entire or not. Therefore, that gives us the ability to make our decisions on a variable basis and keep as much of that cost structure variable as possible. Obviously, we\u2019ll practice a yield strategy overall just like we always have.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay.\nLowell Singer: And, Christine, do you want to take the second question?\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. Hi, Michael.\nMichael Nathanson: Hi, Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: On the furloughed employees, so the impact that we saw on our parks full segment for Q2 included fully paying everybody. We continued to do that until early April when we did furlough companywide over 100,000 employees. But most of those employees were in the park segment by just the sheer numbers. So while they are furloughed, we are still paying their portion of their medical benefits. So they\u2019re not out of pocket or any of their benefits. We thought that was very, very important to do. And when we think about our costs too for the parks, we think about it as three levels. There is the fixed component, which is depreciation, taxes, property taxes and insurance. The big chunk of that depreciation is a non-cash item. The other two, obviously are cash items. Then you have the variable costs and those are cost of goods sold and that\u2019s where you do have significant flexibility pretty early on the time curve. And then there is another chunk of costs where we would put in labor and that is what we call semi-fixed and they are fixed in the short term, just looking at how long it took to do what we had to do to furlough employees, once again we are not \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t have done it until we had more information that indicated that the parks will be closed for not just a couple of weeks, but we\u2019re now into months. And it also include \u2013 then we have more variable costs in that semi-fixed. And that includes the labor, also SG&A. So we\u2019ve been taking measures there to eliminate whatever costs we can and other operating expenses. So the furloughed employees will benefit Q3, but we\u2019ve also done things in the SG&A area that we believe are appropriate given the current state of being closed.\nLowell Singer: Hey, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nSteven Cahall: Yes, thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on parks question and talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about contingency plans and sort of brand safety. I imagine if you opened it far below attendance as you talked about, you would have a lot of pent-up demand and then you kind of got to decide who gets to come in and what the screening measures are and it seems like a whole Pandora\u2019s Box, I am just wondering about your willingness to sort of wait into that today versus waiting for a vaccine? And then second on Hulu, kind of modest sequential growth in the live product, but ARPU was up a lot. Could you help us think about how much of that was the pricing versus the ad ARPU or the subscription versus the ad ARPU and how are you thinking about driving both subs and ARPU on that product going forward? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Bob Chapek will take the first question about parks and then I will ask Christine to take the Hulu question.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of sort of contingency plans going forward, one of the ways that we are going to deal with this situation in Shanghai and that\u2019s no promise that we will deal with that the same way domestically, but is through dated tickets, so that you don\u2019t have a whole bunch of people showing up at your gates and then finding out that we have reached our limit by 9:00 a.m. and then they go back disappointed. So we are very conscious of that particular oversubscription, if you will, relative to demand that we are going to have. And so we will handle that through either dated ticketing or something very similar.\nChristine McCarthy: And on the Hulu ARPU, Steve, I think you\u2019re really looking at the live TV ARPU. That was up 29% year-over-year and that was because we took a price increase in the quarter and that\u2019s reflected in that 29% increase. It\u2019s roughly $15 per sub. On the SVOD product, it actually declined a little bit year-over-year. But the one thing I would mention there is, there is some seasonality to advertising on Hulu and coming out of the holiday period which is our first quarter that\u2019s what is reflected in the SVOD number.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJason Bazinet: I just have two questions from the Q. One was your decision to continue to pay the sports rights owners even though there aren\u2019t sports, if you could just elaborate on that and how long that could endure if sports don\u2019t come back soon? And then the second one is on the dividend, can you just provide a little bit of color in terms of how you\u2019re thinking, what are the major swing factors in terms of not potentially paying dividend beyond just the one dividend that you\u2019ve decided not to pay? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Jason. I will ask Christine to take both of those questions, so paying on sports rights and dividend.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Jason. And I am impressed that you are already into the 10-Q. On cash payments paying to the leagues, we are not going to get into discussing the specifics of our various agreements. But what I can tell you is that we are working very, very closely with the leagues and the conference partners and we are looking forward to the return of live events. And we are just \u2013 are in active discussions with them now. So I will just leave it at that. And on the dividend, really these are always very, very tough decisions. But we made a decision for this quarter. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball that allows us to see into the future for how long this disruption is going to keep our businesses closed partially or fully. So we will address the dividend again in the next 6 months.\nJason Bazinet: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Jason thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey, great. Thanks. Maybe two quick follow-ups on the park and then a second question. First, can you tell us what the capacity limitations are on the Shanghai park when you guys open up next week? Number two, anything you can tell us about U.S. parks attendance in terms of what percentage of typical attendees say in 2019 drove versus flew, trying to get a sense for how many of the visitors are local versus from say out of state? And then second question is there anything you could tell us on sort of ad revenue trends in April or thus far in May that would be great? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thank you, John. Bob, do you want to take the parks questions and then Christine, do you want to take the ad trends question?\nBob Chapek: Sure. You got it. In terms of Shanghai Disney Resort, our capacity tends to be 80,000 a day. The government is putting a limit on that. Roughly they want us to be at about 30% of that. So it\u2019s 24,000 a day. We\u2019re going to actually open up far below that just to have our training wheels on with our new procedures and processes to make sure we don\u2019t have any lines backing up either as guests entering into the park or as they wade through the park. So we\u2019re going to approach that very, very slowly. But after a few weeks we will actually be up to what the government\u2019s guideline is and at that point there could be some lifting of even those restrictions of the 30%. So those are the metrics there. In terms of U.S. park attendees, it really depends on which part you\u2019re talking about. Obviously, the Anaheim Park has much more of a drive-in market and lot less folks that stay overnight a lot less guests that stay overnight where Orlando has a big predominance of folks that actually \u2013 families that actually fly in to go visit there, but we have a fairly robust annual pass program at both parks and a big drive-in market as well, but it\u2019s significantly different in terms of the overnight guests and those that might fly in Orlando.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, John. And to answer your question on ad revenue, obviously this whole COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our ad sales. I think that\u2019s fair to say for anyone in the advertising business on one side or the other. And it\u2019s really due \u2013 for us, due to the lack of live sporting events and the pullback from advertisers in categories that are most impacted. So we have seen declines in demand from industries like movie studios, restaurants, travel, tourism, retail, domestic auto, those are all the things that have \u2013 we are seeing pullbacks in. But on the other hand, we\u2019ve seen some advertisers opportunistically increasing their spend and some of those industry groups are things like financial services, tech, telecom, the DTC or streaming services and also consumer packaged goods. When you net out all of that, the net impact is what we are expecting as a significant decline in ad sales. And we will see it more at ESPN because of the lack of live sporting events than we will at the broadcast network.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Christine.\nLowell Singer: John, thank you. Operator, I think we will take one more question today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from John Janedis with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nJohn Janedis: Thank you. Maybe one quick one, you spoke to live sports and the hope that we will start to see sports come back over the next couple of months. Depending on timing, there could be, I guess a lot hitting in the fourth quarter and at the same time there may not be a lot of scripted programming from prime time. So can you talk about your ability to maybe air some of the content that would traditionally be on ESPN on ABC and how are you thinking about the fall or winter season in terms of programming? And then maybe Christine a quick one as a follow-up to John, can you give us any kind of order of magnitude in terms of maybe sports relative to non-sports on advertising?\nLowell Singer: Hey, John. Thanks for the questions and welcome back.\nJohn Janedis: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Bob Chapek, do you want to take the first one and then we will turn it over to Christine?\nBob Chapek: I think if our executives over at ESPN and ABC have shown anything over the last two months it\u2019s the fact that they can be nimble and be very creative at being nimble. So in terms of being able to toggle between one outlet and another whether it\u2019s between ABC to ESPN or ESPN to ABC or ESPN to ESPN+, as you know we\u2019ve made quite a number of changes given the changes in the environment. And I suspect that we would be able to do that same toggling going forward into the future, depending on what happens in terms of what sports come back, how they come back and look at everything essentially through the lens of our guests and our consumers and how they want to enjoy and how they can enjoy. I also point out to the fact that the NFL Draft was such an unbelievable success for us and that is a perfect example of being nimble. We had over three nights, over 15 million households which is obviously a huge increase and I think that speaks volumes to the fact that our cast and our executives over those networks do a phenomenal job of being able to adjust on the play.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, John. And on your question about the order of magnitude of sports versus non-sports for ad sales declines, as you may remember we combined our ad sales into one unit back in 2018 and we are now \u2013 we have one group who sells across the Media Networks segment. So, we haven\u2019t really \u2013 and we don\u2019t really intend to break out sports versus non-sports. However, it is fair to say that sports, i.e., ESPN is being more significantly impacted and that is you can do the math around that with your expectations, but there\u2019s definitely more ad sales decline year-over-year hitting ESPN.\nJohn Janedis: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks. Yes. Thank you, John. Thanks for the questions and thanks again everyone for joining us today. Note that a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that were referred to on this call to equivalent GAAP measures can be found on our Investor Relations website. Also later today, we will post to our IR website a document that includes more information about our treatment of inter-segment content transactions. In our remarks we provided estimates of the performance of certain 21CF assets in periods of the prior year. These estimates are based on an analysis of 21CF records, but are nonetheless unaudited estimates and are not precise measures of historical results before the acquisition.

Once again, please stay safe everyone. Thanks for joining us today and this concludes today\u2019s call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. These are truly unprecedented times and the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our company in a number of significant ways. From a financial standpoint, we estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19 related disruption on our second quarter operating income with as much as $1.4 billion, with the majority of that impact at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. As a result, excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $0.60. Bob Chapek highlighted a number of steps we have already taken to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our financial performance. We have also been very focused on strengthening our liquidity position to ensure we have adequate resources to fund our operations during this crisis. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. Those who have followed the company over the years know that we have historically taken a prudent approach to managing our balance sheet and liquidity. So despite the current business challenges, we believe we start from a position of relative strength. We took proactive and decisive steps during the quarter to further enhance our liquidity position by issuing $6 billion of term debt, which contributed to a cash and cash equivalents balance of $14.3 billion to end the quarter. And a week after the quarter ended, we issued another $925 million in term debt. Last month, we closed on a new $5 billion 364-day bank facility, which combined with our existing credit facilities of $12.25 billion, provides us with total credit facility capacity of $17.25 billion. I will note that the $12.25 credit facilities also serve to backstop our commercial paper program. We are evaluating a wide range of scenarios with respect to the potential ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses, while prudently managing cash outflows. And overall, we feel confident in our ability to manage through the crisis. We continue to actively evaluate additional mitigation strategies to position our company to emerge from this crisis with the financial flexibility necessary to get back on a growth path. From a cash flow standpoint, the Board has made the decision to forego payment of a semi-annual dividend for the first half of the fiscal year, which would have been payable in July. This preserves about $1.6 billion in cash assuming we had held the dividend constant at $0.88 per share. We also identified opportunities to reduce our capital spending and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be about $900 million lower than our prior guidance, or $400 million below prior year, driven primarily by paused construction and refurbishment work due to the temporary closing of our parks. While it is still too early to consider more specific implications for capital spending in fiscal 2021, we remain confident in our investment decisions and the resiliency of our businesses. Prior to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic with the exception of Hong Kong Disneyland, the rest of our parks and experiences businesses were trending well ahead of prior year. As we had previously disclosed, Hong Kong Disneyland faced challenges due to significant declines in visitation from China and other parts of Asia. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 11% in the second quarter. I'll remind you that the Disneyland Resort closed on March 14 and Walt Disney World closed March 16. We estimate the closure of our domestic parks had an adverse impact on attendance growth of approximately 18 percentage points. Per capita guest spending during the period the parks were open was up 13% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% and occupancy was down 16 points to 77%, which reflects a 13% decline in occupied room nights. We estimate the closure of our domestic hotels had an adverse impact on occupied room nights of approximately 15 points. As a result of the unprecedented disruptions to our businesses, Q2 operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products was significantly lower compared to Q2 last year. We estimate the disruption to our Parks, Experiences and Products businesses adversely impacted Q2 operating income by approximately $1 billion. As we look ahead, while we've announced plans to reopen Shanghai Disney Resort, there is limited visibility into the timing of reopening and the conditions under which we can reopen the rest of our parks and resorts, cruise ships and Disney stores. However, we believe the strength of our brands and our unwavering commitment to the guest experience are valuable assets that will serve us and our guests well once we reopen. At Studio Entertainment, operating income was lower in the quarter as higher TV/SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio were more than offset by higher film impairments, lower worldwide theatrical distribution results at our legacy film studio and a decline in our stage play business due to the impact of COVID-19. Worldwide theatrical results in the quarter were adversely impacted by higher bad debt reserves for receivables due from exhibitors and by lower revenue due to the closure of theaters around the world. In aggregate, the performance of key titles in the quarter, which included Frozen 2, Star Wars, The Rise of Skywalker and Onward was comparable to key theatrical titles in Q2 last year, which included Captain Marvel, Mary Poppins Returns and Dumbo. We feel the performance of Onward was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic given its release date relative to when theaters began to close. Higher legacy TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Aladdin, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. The 21CF studio business was a positive contributor in the quarter as higher operating income from TV/SVOD distribution more than offset an operating loss at worldwide theatrical and general and administrative costs. Turning to Media Networks, operating income was up in the second quarter due to higher results at broadcasting as cable operating income was roughly comparable to Q2 last year. At Broadcasting the increase in operating income was due to the consolidation of 21CF, largely reflecting program sales and to a lesser extent an increase in our legacy broadcasting operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to higher affiliate revenue and lower programming and production costs, partially offset by lower program sales from ABC Studios and higher network marketing costs. The decrease in network programming and production costs was due to a timing benefit from new accounting guidance, partially offset by more hours of higher cost specials and a contractual rate increase for the Academy Awards in the current quarter. More detail on the new accounting guidance is contained in the 10-Q filing. But I'll note that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expense during the first half of the fiscal year, we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. Lower ABC Studios program sales reflect the prior year sale of Jessica Jones and How to Get Away with Murder in Q2 last year. Total broadcasting ad revenue was 3% higher in the quarter driven by consolidation of 21CF and higher political advertising at our owned stations. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to Q2 last year. Cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, largely offset by a decrease at ESPN where growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs and lower advertising revenue. Higher programming and production costs at ESPN were primarily driven by contractual rate increases for the College Football Playoffs and college basketball and costs associated with the launch of the ACC Network. Total ESPN advertising revenue was down approximately 8% in the second quarter as higher rates were more than offset by lower average viewership. Total viewership was negatively impacted by the cancellation of live sporting events in the latter part of the quarter, primarily NBA and college basketball championship week. So far this quarter ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing significantly below this time last year, reflecting the current challenges in the marketplace due to the lack of live sports inventory coupled with limited advertiser demand. However, we have seen a couple of bright spots so far this quarter with record viewership for the first six episodes of The Last Dance, our highest-rated original documentary of all time. Additionally, the NFL Draft, was the most watched ever, reaching more than 55 million viewers over the three-day event and average audience growth of 58% on ESPN versus last year. The performance of these two events suggests there is meaningful pent-up demand from fans for compelling sports programming and ESPN continues to be well positioned to capitalize on this demand. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 16% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 13 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 3 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which benefited by about 2.5 points due to the launch of the ACC Network. At our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment operating losses were $427 million higher in the quarter driven by costs incurred to support the ongoing launch of Disney+ around the world and the consolidation of Hulu. Disney+ launched in a number of European markets during the quarter, which contributed to a total paid subscriber base of $33.5 million at the end of the quarter. And we are very pleased with the success of our rollout in Western Europe and India, including the execution of previously announced deals with some European platforms to distribute the service to all paid subscribers on certain of the widely distributed tiers and in India to convert our pre-existing subscription based Hotstar service to Disney+ Hotstar. As we announced on April 8, during the third quarter, we exceeded 15 million Disney+ paid subscribers. More information about those launches is available in our Form 10-Q. Because we executed a number of launches between quarter-end and today, we have decided to bring these numbers current. As of May 4th, we estimate we had approximately 54.5 million Disney+ subscribers reflecting a subscriber mix generally similar to our mix at April 8. Segment results also reflect the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu and a benefit from the consolidation of the 21CF international cable businesses. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $500 million, which came in a little better than the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our direct-to-consumer and international segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the third quarter and we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, in particular, Disney+ to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $420 million. Revenue eliminations increased $1.2 billion and profit eliminations increased $211 million compared to Q2 last year driven primarily by higher intersegment content sales from studio and media networks to DTCI. And finally, the 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of inter-segment eliminations, contributed approximately $460 million in segment operating income in the second quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out inter-segment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $200 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu, had a dilutive impact on our Q2 EPS before purchase accounting, although it was less dilutive than we expected. This is obviously a very fluid situation and given the lack of visibility around when some businesses will reopen fully or partially and the conditions under which they reopen, we don't intend to provide specific guidance around our expectations for the remainder of the year. These are uncertain times and our people and businesses are being impacted in significant ways. Despite these near-term challenges, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our company. And with that, I will turn the call over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions. Okay. Hi, Ben. How are you? Hope you are doing well and your family as well. Let me answer the question on parks as best I can. As you know we are dealing with a situation that's very fluid and things are changing. So, the results that you saw for the second quarter reflect approximately 2ish weeks of our domestic parks being closed, because we closed Disneyland on the 14th and World on the 16. And then you had the Asian parks closed, Shanghai closed fully in January on the 25, Hong Kong closed on the 26, Tokyo, which is a royalty revenue stream that we get, that closed on the 29. So the $1 billion that was attributable to the parks business and products for the quarter just for that second quarter about $1 billion, you could roughly think of it that the two weeks domestic is a little over half. And then you have the Asian \u2013 or the international parks and cruise, which are the balance. So when you think about Hong Kong we already had issues that related to their own domestic issues. So we had already telegraphed that there would be some softness in Hong Kong and then this closure of the park just accelerated the losses there. And Shanghai had been doing quite well up until the moment that we are closed. And I am going to ask Bob Chapek if he has any other thoughts that he would like to add to that. And, Ben, I would just add that we are still launching in new markets. So while we have had a really good start to Disney+ we still think it's early and we'll update when it's appropriate. Sure. Jessica we don't break down our individual businesses within the segment, but \u2013 so for the percent of revenue and operating income, given the size of our global parks business that includes the cruise business and now it includes consumer products. It's a relatively small percentage of operating income and revenue. But that being said and this just builds on some of the things Bob said, this is a business that is one of our highest rated businesses in terms of guest satisfaction and it also has a very high intent to repeat the experience. So a lot of people who go on one tend to go back for multiple cruises. So \u2013 and it's also a business when we look at it from an ROI perspective, ROIC perspective, it's a very nice returning business creating value long term for shareholders. Sure. Hi, Michael. On the furloughed employees, so the impact that we saw on our parks full segment for Q2 included fully paying everybody. We continued to do that until early April when we did furlough companywide over 100,000 employees. But most of those employees were in the park segment by just the sheer numbers. So while they are furloughed, we are still paying their portion of their medical benefits. So they're not out of pocket or any of their benefits. We thought that was very, very important to do. And when we think about our costs too for the parks, we think about it as three levels. There is the fixed component, which is depreciation, taxes, property taxes and insurance. The big chunk of that depreciation is a non-cash item. The other two, obviously are cash items. Then you have the variable costs and those are cost of goods sold and that's where you do have significant flexibility pretty early on the time curve. And then there is another chunk of costs where we would put in labor and that is what we call semi-fixed and they are fixed in the short term, just looking at how long it took to do what we had to do to furlough employees, once again we are not \u2013 we wouldn't have done it until we had more information that indicated that the parks will be closed for not just a couple of weeks, but we're now into months. And it also include \u2013 then we have more variable costs in that semi-fixed. And that includes the labor, also SG&A. So we've been taking measures there to eliminate whatever costs we can and other operating expenses. So the furloughed employees will benefit Q3, but we've also done things in the SG&A area that we believe are appropriate given the current state of being closed. And on the Hulu ARPU, Steve, I think you're really looking at the live TV ARPU. That was up 29% year-over-year and that was because we took a price increase in the quarter and that's reflected in that 29% increase. It's roughly $15 per sub. On the SVOD product, it actually declined a little bit year-over-year. But the one thing I would mention there is, there is some seasonality to advertising on Hulu and coming out of the holiday period which is our first quarter that's what is reflected in the SVOD number. Hi, Jason. And I am impressed that you are already into the 10-Q. On cash payments paying to the leagues, we are not going to get into discussing the specifics of our various agreements. But what I can tell you is that we are working very, very closely with the leagues and the conference partners and we are looking forward to the return of live events. And we are just \u2013 are in active discussions with them now. So I will just leave it at that. And on the dividend, really these are always very, very tough decisions. But we made a decision for this quarter. We don't have a crystal ball that allows us to see into the future for how long this disruption is going to keep our businesses closed partially or fully. So we will address the dividend again in the next 6 months. Hi, John. And to answer your question on ad revenue, obviously this whole COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our ad sales. I think that's fair to say for anyone in the advertising business on one side or the other. And it's really due \u2013 for us, due to the lack of live sporting events and the pullback from advertisers in categories that are most impacted. So we have seen declines in demand from industries like movie studios, restaurants, travel, tourism, retail, domestic auto, those are all the things that have \u2013 we are seeing pullbacks in. But on the other hand, we've seen some advertisers opportunistically increasing their spend and some of those industry groups are things like financial services, tech, telecom, the DTC or streaming services and also consumer packaged goods. When you net out all of that, the net impact is what we are expecting as a significant decline in ad sales. And we will see it more at ESPN because of the lack of live sporting events than we will at the broadcast network. Hi, John. And on your question about the order of magnitude of sports versus non-sports for ad sales declines, as you may remember we combined our ad sales into one unit back in 2018 and we are now \u2013 we have one group who sells across the Media Networks segment. So, we haven't really \u2013 and we don't really intend to break out sports versus non-sports. However, it is fair to say that sports, i.e., ESPN is being more significantly impacted and that is you can do the math around that with your expectations, but there's definitely more ad sales decline year-over-year hitting ESPN."

            "name": "Bob Chapek",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob and good afternoon everyone. I hope you are all doing well and staying safe. When I stepped into this new job, 2.5 months ago, none of us could have imagined the suffering and sacrifice that we are now seeing around the world. This devastating pandemic is like nothing most of us have ever experienced in our lifetime. This had a profound impact on millions of lives, physically, psychologically, financially causing tremendous hardship and loss. And just about everyone has been affected in one way or another either personally or through someone they know a friend, family member neighbor, or colleague. Fortunately, amidst the adversity, we see the best of humanity demonstrated through inspiring acts of compassion and selflessness from the courageous healthcare workers caring for people on the frontlines in hospitals across the country, to our first responders and others providing essential services throughout our communities. We are grateful for and deeply appreciative of their efforts. Here at Disney, as Bob mentioned, we are also grateful to our own employees, starting with our local and national ABC News teams providing critical and factual information around the clock; our ESPN team providing compelling programming in the absence of live sports, our global security personnel and key staff who are safeguarding and maintaining our parks and resorts, they are doing a phenomenal job and we could not be more proud of them. As you know, Disney, like many other companies, has experienced widespread disruption. In mid-March, we have closed our domestic parks and hotels indefinitely, suspended our cruise line, halted film and TV productions and shuttered our retail stores. And while these were necessary steps to ensure the safety and well-being of our guest and employees, our businesses have been hugely impacted. In the second fiscal quarter, adjusted EPS fell to $0.60 a share from $1.61 a year earlier primarily due to the suspended operations I just outlined. Christine will talk more in depth about our results for the quarter and the ongoing financial impact of COVID-19. Before she does, I want to share a few thoughts on the destruction we are seeing across our company as well as our confidence and our ability to weather the storm. While it's too early to predict when we will be able to begin resuming all of our operations, we are evaluating a number of different scenarios to ensure a cautious, sensible and deliberate approach to the eventual reopening of our parks. As you know, our parks have been closed around the world, Shanghai and Hong Kong since January, Tokyo since February, and our U.S. and Paris parks since mid-March. The approach we take may include implementation of guest capacity and density control measures as well as health and prevention procedures that comply with state and federal guidelines. We are seeing encouraging signs of a gradual return to some semblance of normalcy in China. And in light of the lifting of certain restrictions in recent weeks and the successful reopening of our park adjacent retail and food and beverage area, Disneytown, we and our government partners, Shanghai Shendi Group, plan to open Shanghai Disneyland on May 11. We will take a phased approach with limits on attendance using an advanced reservation and entry system, controlled guest density using social distancing and strict government required health and prevention procedures. These include the use of masks, temperature screenings and other contact tracing and early detection systems. Moving to Media Networks, ESPN has truly stepped up in the absence of live sports finding new and innovative ways to deliver compelling content that fans want. This included releasing, 2 months early, the highly anticipated 10-part docuseries on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, The Last Dance. The series, which continues through May 17, is the most viewed ESPN documentary ever and currently ranks as the number one program in America, amongst all key male demos since sports halted. ESPN also took what has historically been an engaging life event and turn into a virtual one with the NFL draft. This resulted in the bigger audience than ever before with a record 55 million plus viewers over the 3-day event. The draft was a particularly impressive technological feet driven by more than 600 remote camera feeds from homes across the U.S. When you look at the impact of these two events, ESPN's April prime-time audience, was up 11% versus last year among adults 18 to 49. In fact, it tanked as the top cable network among this key demographic. Going forward, ESPN is going to be rolling out three new films as part of its award winning 30 for 30 series. We are also going to air virtual 2020 ESPYs on June 21. Additionally, ESPN will be bringing back several more of its marquee studio programs beginning in the week of May 11. This will expand their live and quick turnaround studio programming to 11 straight hours each weekday. Sports will come back strong. And when they do, we believe ESPN is best positioned to benefit with more offerings than anyone else. And if it's a gradual process, where sports return for a period without spectators in the stance, we can count on ESPN to bring the same level of innovations that we saw with the NFL draft and continue to deliver our great experience for sports fans. On the studio side, we are incredibly excited about our upcoming slate of films. However, with theatres closed and our production shutdown due to COVID-19, we have had to reschedule a number of release dates for tentpole movies. These include Disney's Mulan for July 24, Marvel's Black Widow for November 6, Pixar's Soul on November 20, and 20th Century's Free Guy set for December 11. As many of your already know, Artemis Fowl, originally slated for a theatrical run, will debut exclusively in Disney+ starting on June 12. As we have said, our company's top priority and our key to our growth is our direct-to-consumer business. And I am pleased to say that the response to Disney+ in particular has exceeded even our highest expectations. We have been thrilled with the performance of the service since our initial launch in November and we continue to expand into other markets. In late March, as planned and despite COVID-19, we had an incredibly successful launch of Disney+ in Western Europe, followed by a highly successful launch in India. We announced in early April that in just 5 months we have surpassed 50 million subscribers globally, a significant milestone for us. We have been quite pleased with the growth that we have seen in the 4 weeks since then and there is more to come. Disney+ will begin rolling out in Japan in June, followed by the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September and Latin America will follow towards the end of the year. This robust collection of library and original content available on Disney+ continues to grow, including with Disney's Frozen 2 and Pixar's Onward, which were released early as a special offering for families as a shelter at home. Yesterday's SVOD premier of Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker and the new behind the scenes documentary about the making of one of Disney+'s most successful series, The Mandalorian, along with the fall premier of National Geographic's original series, The Right Stuff, based on the book by Tom Wolfe about NASA's Project Mercury. This quarter, Hulu saw the successful launch of FX on Hulu. Nearly, 45% of Hulu subscribers have accessed library, current and original content from the FX network on the service. Also, Hulu's strong original series continue to perform extremely well as evidenced by the critically acclaimed hit series, Little Fires Everywhere, amongst others. Hulu had 32 million total subscribers at the end of Q2. We are enormously proud of what we have accomplished to-date and we are optimistic for the future. As I said earlier, our businesses have experienced considerable disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This forced us to implement a variety of measures to manage the short and long-term financial impact on our company. The first was a substantial reduction in senior executive compensation company-wide, which will remain in effect until we see a substantive economic recovery. We were fortunate for the first 5 weeks to be able to pay full salaries to those employees who were unable to perform their duties. However, with no way to predict when this crisis will end, we made the very difficult decision to begin the furloughs on April 19. Unlike layoffs, the furlough process allows impacted workers to remain as Disney employees, while continuing to receive their full healthcare benefits paid for by the company. We are fully committed to getting our employees back to work as quickly as the current situation allows. While these were not easy decisions, I do believe they have been the right ones given the unprecedented challenges that we are faced with. Now, before I turn it over to Christine, let me just reiterate what Bob said and that is Disney is an exceptionally resilient company. With a great management team and thousands of talented and dedicated employees, we continue to deliver exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling that consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for and we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position. With that, I will turn it over to Christine to talk more about the quarter and then we will be happy to answer your questions. No, it's just that we were doing everything we can to mitigate the impact of the cash burn while we are obviously in this situation and we are trying to be as responsible as possible, both short term in terms of operating expenses and labor but also longer term in terms of how we allocate capital. Sure. We are obviously thrilled with the progress of Disney+ and how we've been able to increase the base there. We're not really prepared to update our guidance and certainly wouldn't give any projections in terms of when we would reach profitability. But we know that in terms of the actual investment in Disney+ that new programming, hit new programming like the Mandalorian certainly drives that business. And so I think we'll continue to make the planned investments into Disney+ as we always have with new and exciting programming to drive those subscription rates and retention. Alright. Hello, Alexia in terms of how we look at our park reopening and what hurdle we need to make to have it make sense, we actually look at it as a positive net contribution to overhead and profit. Another word, it's not about break-even point for profitability necessarily, but just making a positive contribution at the net contribution level. So what we are thinking is that while every site is completely different, that's the approach that we're going to take. And frankly we would not reopen any park unless we can make at least a positive contribution to that overhead and operating profit level. In terms of the second question in terms of the studio and what type of audiences will Mulan see it when it opens up? We're going to get a pretty good idea of that because there is a competitive movie that opens up one week before our film does. And at that point we're hoping that there is some return to semblance of normal, in terms of number of screens that are opening in a number of showtimes for those movies. So our fingers are crossed. Obviously, that's our first big move of the gate. But again between some balance of limited number of seats in theaters as social distancing practiced by the exhibitors combined with what's got to be an incredible pent-up demand. I think, we will shortly find out and maybe we'll find out the week before was a competitive movie. Okay. In terms of our interest in Hulu internationally, given everything that's happening, you said you can make an argument either away, frankly we, long-term, are still bullish about Hulu international. Right now though, given the cash situation and the sort of uncertainty around our overall business, we've got no plans immediately to make any investment in that business internationally. But that again is short term only because of the COVID situation that we're sort of faced with. And the second question was again? Oh, large-scale production and when will it \u2013 yes. In terms of large-scale production, we're going to go through the same process with our productions as we do our theme parks in terms of absolutely guaranteeing that we're going to be responsible in terms of how we put both our own employees and other filmmakers that are partners with us as they do these productions. So we've got no projections of exactly when we can do that, but we will be very responsible in terms of mask and the same type of procedures that we would hope to implement into our parks when we sort of proceed. And the third question? Yes. So we very much believe in the value of the theatrical experience overall to launch blockbuster movies. As you know, we had 7 $1 billion films in calendar year \u201819. But we also realize that either because of changing and evolving consumer dynamics or because of certain situations like COVID, we may have to make some changes to that overall strategy just because theaters aren't open or aren't open to the extent that anybody needs to be financially viable. So we're going to evaluate each one of our movies on a case-by-case situation as we are doing right now during this coronavirus situation. I think you know that Artemis Fowl is moving over to Disney+ given the demographics of appeal of that film, which was not originally the plan. And \u2013 but all our other Temple movies have been rescheduled theatrically for later in the year. So we very much believe in the power of that launch platform for our big movies. Yes, in terms of Shanghai it's going to be masks for guests and employees. The only characters that will not wear masks are the face characters and they'll be at a distance from crowds. Okay. In terms of the future rides and the business models, we think that live sports remain incredibly valuable to us and we continue to have an interest in live sports rights given the unique slate of assets that we own with ESPN, ESPN+ and ABC. And we're going to do that, though, as we always have done in a very disciplined manner. Existing consumer trends play a real big part on how we think about the value of sports rights as they make the transition from linear over to digital. And I think it really \u2013 it's a bit premature to give any specific details on what the strategy is other than we're obviously highly interested in those and we think we want to make the evolution along with the consumer as they go from linear to digital. In terms of the CapEx question, obviously we had a lot of really big plans in the parks and we still continue to have big plans. Those good ideas before COVID are going to be really good ideas after. And as Christine said in her opening remarks, there are certain trimmings that we're doing here and there to be responsible from a financial standpoint, but we have such great intellectual property and our Imagineers over at our theme over at our theme parks where the majority of our capital goes have done such a tremendous job of planning out future experiences for our guests that we're just going to go ahead and take a slightly finer-tooth comb, if you will, through those expenditures but essentially plan on investing behind those businesses like we always have. And in terms of the cruise ship business, we agree that that will probably be the last of our travel oriented businesses to come back online. Interestingly enough long term all of our data and our research shows that our guests will be just as interested in cruising with us long term. Obviously not in the next few months but much more resilient than any of the competitive businesses because of that love for Disney and assurance that they feel, that they trust our business to act in a responsible way to help to the extent possible protect them against some of the woes that have plagued the industry since COVID has hit. Yes, in terms of the signals we look for park opening, our hypothesis is because of pent-up demand that if we open up at something less than 50% of our standard capacity that we're probably not going to have trouble filling that. So whatever level we save that at , whether it's 10%, 25% or 50% of typical crowds, that's what we'll be able to have at our park. Therefore we will staff accordingly to that type of level, whatever that level will be eventually. In terms of optimization and sort of how we'll approach that, obviously labor is a huge component of our cost base and so that will slide with the attendance. And that's why I said when we're looking at the decisions for what that level would be inside the parks and what we're going to be targeting for, it's really looked at as a contribution to net contribution and profit as opposed to saying that we're going to sort of cover the entire or not. Therefore, that gives us the ability to make our decisions on a variable basis and keep as much of that cost structure variable as possible. Obviously, we'll practice a yield strategy overall just like we always have. Okay. In terms of sort of contingency plans going forward, one of the ways that we are going to deal with this situation in Shanghai and that's no promise that we will deal with that the same way domestically, but is through dated tickets, so that you don't have a whole bunch of people showing up at your gates and then finding out that we have reached our limit by 9:00 a.m. and then they go back disappointed. So we are very conscious of that particular oversubscription, if you will, relative to demand that we are going to have. And so we will handle that through either dated ticketing or something very similar. Sure. You got it. In terms of Shanghai Disney Resort, our capacity tends to be 80,000 a day. The government is putting a limit on that. Roughly they want us to be at about 30% of that. So it's 24,000 a day. We're going to actually open up far below that just to have our training wheels on with our new procedures and processes to make sure we don't have any lines backing up either as guests entering into the park or as they wade through the park. So we're going to approach that very, very slowly. But after a few weeks we will actually be up to what the government's guideline is and at that point there could be some lifting of even those restrictions of the 30%. So those are the metrics there. In terms of U.S. park attendees, it really depends on which part you're talking about. Obviously, the Anaheim Park has much more of a drive-in market and lot less folks that stay overnight a lot less guests that stay overnight where Orlando has a big predominance of folks that actually \u2013 families that actually fly in to go visit there, but we have a fairly robust annual pass program at both parks and a big drive-in market as well, but it's significantly different in terms of the overnight guests and those that might fly in Orlando. I think if our executives over at ESPN and ABC have shown anything over the last two months it's the fact that they can be nimble and be very creative at being nimble. So in terms of being able to toggle between one outlet and another whether it's between ABC to ESPN or ESPN to ABC or ESPN to ESPN+, as you know we've made quite a number of changes given the changes in the environment. And I suspect that we would be able to do that same toggling going forward into the future, depending on what happens in terms of what sports come back, how they come back and look at everything essentially through the lens of our guests and our consumers and how they want to enjoy and how they can enjoy. I also point out to the fact that the NFL Draft was such an unbelievable success for us and that is a perfect example of being nimble. We had over three nights, over 15 million households which is obviously a huge increase and I think that speaks volumes to the fact that our cast and our executives over those networks do a phenomenal job of being able to adjust on the play."

            "name": "Bob Iger",
            "content": "Thanks, Lowell and good afternoon, everyone. Obviously, much has changed in the world since our last earnings call and the challenges we are now facing are unprecedented. Like so many other companies and industries, the pandemic has hit us hard and both Bob and Christine will walk you through the specifics. However, as someone who has been around for awhile and let this company through some really tough days over the last 15 years, including economic downturns, natural disasters and other unforeseen events, I have absolute confidence in our ability to get through this challenging period and recover successfully. The Walt Disney Company has demonstrated repeatedly over its nearly 100-year history that it is exceptionally resilient. And I believe this time will be no different. We entered this crisis with a strong hand and an exceptional management team now led by Bob Chapek. And as we said in February, when Bob was announced as CEO, he and I continue to work in partnership in support of the company's objectives and to ensure a smooth and successful transition. As you would expect when dealing with a challenge of this magnitude, the entire team is working closely together taking an all hands on deck approach to address the difficult issues we are facing. Of course, one key to our resilience is the strength of our brands and the strong emotional connection people have to them: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ABC, ESPN and Star Wars. In fact, recent studies have shown we have maintained that connection with consumers throughout this crisis. We also have a tremendous collection of assets. And beyond that, what we create has never been more necessary or more important than right now. In fact, it's quite possible that what we create is appreciated now more than ever, because people find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism. This is the same reason we believe people will resume familiar activities once this crisis ends. They missed doing the things they enjoy things that make them feel happy and connected with family and friends, whether it's going to movie theaters to see our films or visiting our theme parks around the world or watching live sports on ESPN. People want good news. They want to experience joy and the feeling of togetherness. And for all these reasons, we will continue to tell stories that uplift and enrich people's lives. While much of our operations are shutdown, we have been fortunate to keep parts of our creative pipeline active, including a number of writing and development projects, while also continuing postproduction work from media networks, our studios and Disney+. And I have been working with our creative teams across the company and I am extremely excited about what's in store. I have no doubt that we will get through this, but it will take some time. Before I turn it over to Bob and Christine to talk about the quarter and the strategy going forward and to answer your questions, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for all of the medical professionals across our country who are fighting valiantly to save lives and to everyone helping to flatten the curve by heeding the advice of health officials and others, it's all making a difference. On behalf of Bob and myself, I also want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees around the world who continue to show incredible ingenuity, commitment, patience and understanding during these trying times. Even in the face of adversity, their dedication to our company and our mission is unwavering and we couldn't be more proud of them. And with that, I will hand it over to Bob."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's first quarter 2020 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and the webcast and a transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are, Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will of course be happy to take your questions. So with that let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nRobert Iger: Thanks Low, and good afternoon everyone. We've had a great quarter and a very productive start to the year, but before I talk about the quarter, let me begin with the events in Asia related to the Coronavirus. Certainly our hearts go out to all those affected by this devastating outbreak, including the thousands of people who work for us in the region. In line with numerous prevention efforts taking place across China, we've temporarily closed our parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and we will continue to closely monitor this public health crisis. Christine will have details about the developing financial impact in her comments. Turning to the quarter, since our last call, our studio released two more films that exceeded $1 billion each at the global Box Office. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which concluded the nine episode Skywalker saga; and Frozen 2 which became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time with more than $1.4 billion in global sales, surpassing the original Frozen, which held the record since 2014. The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2 along with Captain Marvel, Aladdin, The Lion King, Toy Story 4, and the biggest movie of all time, Avengers: Endgame contributed to a total global Box Office for the year for Disney of more than $11 billion, shattering the previous industry record of $7.6 billion set by us in 2016. Many of these films are already available exclusively on Disney+, and the remainder will soon join the service following their home entertainment window. On the parks side, we're thrilled by the overwhelming response to our newest attraction Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, which opened in Orlando in early December, and in Anaheim just a few weeks ago. Our Imagineers and the Design Team at Lucasfilm did an absolutely phenomenal job, and it's one of the most immersive, ambitious, and technologically advanced attractions ever created for a Disney park, and it's elevating storytelling to exciting new levels. Not surprising, Rise of the Resistance has quickly become a fan favorite at both parks and Galaxy's Edge has been a great success at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Of course, the high point of the quarter was the highly anticipated launch of our streaming service, Disney+. Thanks in large part to our incredible portfolio of great brands, the outstanding content from our creative engines and a robust technology platform, the launch of Disney+ has been enormously successful exceeding even our greatest expectations. As we reported previously, we had more than 10 million sign-ups for Disney+ by the end of day 1, and we ended the quarter with 26.5 million paid subscribers. Since then, consumers have continued to sign up for the service directly at disneyplus.com through Verizon, which offers a free year of Disney+ to many of its customers at no additional cost, as well as through other distributors including Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony, and Roku. We recognize there's a lot of interest in this new business, and we wanted to give you some additional context. So, I'm pleased to say that as of Monday, we were at 28.6 million paid subscribers. Going forward, it's our intention to announce subs as of the end of the quarter that we're reporting on. One additional note on sign-ups for Disney+, although we will not provide specifics, is that we are pleased to report that both conversion from free to pay and churn rates were better than we expected. We believe the subscriber growth to-date and the overall reaction to Disney+ reflects a variety of factors that include the uniqueness of the service and excellent user interface, and the high quality of our brands and content. In fact, we are seeing the four-quadrant appeal of our brands reflected in our subscriber numbers as well. On the content side, consumers have enthusiastically embraced the exceptional offering of classic movies and shorts from our studio, including Moana and Frozen. Disney Channel series like Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, recent theatrical releases like The Lion King, which became available on the service on January 28. The Simpsons is also quite popular with all 30 previous seasons available. And our growing slate of original content is also of great interest to our subscribers, especially The Mandalorian which has quickly become a bonafide hit and a cultural phenomenon. Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a certain child in The Mandalorian, who has taken the world by storm. I do believe the sensational response to this new character says so much about Disney+ and our company's ability to connect with audiences. We know there is great anticipation for the substantial array of Baby Yoda consumer products hitting the market in the coming months. We'll continue to add high quality content as a service that includes Frozen 2, and Episode 9, The Rise of Skywalker. Many of you probably saw our Super Bowl spot featuring three original new Marvel series for Disney+. Loki, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which will premiere on the service in August, and WandaVision, which will debut in December. These same characters and actors from the Marvel cinematic universe along with events from these new shows will factor into future Marvel films as we integrate storytelling across these platforms, all under the Marvel Studio banner. We also have the highly anticipated return of The Mandalorian in October and multiple new series from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Nat Geo. So, there's a lot to look forward to. Although our volume will increase, we remain focused on providing quality content from our core franchises and brands, not just quantity as we continue to build our portfolio. And the creative community has taken notice as well, many have expressed interest in joining Disney+\u2019s roster of extraordinary talent. The next big priority is launching Disney+ in numerous international markets, starting in Western Europe on March 24 when we will launch in the U.K. and Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, and Austria. Additional markets including Belgium, the Nordics, and Portugal will follow this summer. In December, we signed a deal with Canal+, the leading pay-TV provider in France. We're currently in talks with several other potential distribution partners throughout the region. We're also excited to announce that we will be launching Disney+ in India through our Hotstar service on March 29, at the beginning of the Indian Premier League Cricket season. We will be rebranding our existing Hotstar VIP and Premium subscription tiers to Disney+ Hotstar. We see this as a great opportunity to use the proven platform of Hotstar to launch the new Disney+ service in one of the most populous countries and fastest-growing economies in the world. Looking across our portfolio of Direct-to-Consumer businesses, we're also pleased with the growth of ESPN plus. We ended the quarter with 6.6 million paid subscribers, and as of Monday, we were at 7.6 million. We've been especially happy with a number of partnerships, particularly with the UFC and the recent McGregor Ceron fight brought in about a 1 million pay-per-view purchases and a 0.5 million new subscribers. We will continue to add content to the service on an opportunistic basis. At Hulu, we recently announced that we will be reorganizing the business to more closely integrat it into our Direct-to-Consumer segment in order to operate more efficiently and effectively as we look to expand our domestic consumer base, as well as our presence outside the U.S. With respect to subscriber numbers, we remain optimistic about the future of the service. Hulu ended the quarter with 30.4 million paid subs and as of Monday, the number was 30.7 million. During our last earnings call, we announced the launch of FX on Hulu, which will be available to all Hulu subscribers at no additional cost. Beginning next month, Hulu will be the exclusive streaming service for all new FX Original programming. FX on Hulu will also offer in-season streaming as well as back seasons for most current and library series. We view this as a fantastic opportunity to expose FX as exceptional content to a broader audience, while also making available to consumers in new ways. We believe there is tremendous appetite for our content and the goal of FX on Hulu is to expand our reach to include those viewers who are not linear pay TV subscribers, and that includes many of Hulu's young and highly engaged streaming audience. The addition of FX as programming is a step in the direction of continued increased investment in high quality programing for Hulu, which will be developed and produced by our existing creative engines. It's all been challenging for a company to pivot in a new strategic direction particularly when it involves navigating between established and emerging business models, but since we announced our intention to shift our strategy, we have made an extraordinary amount of progress. This included a strategic reorganization of our Company, creating a Direct-to-Consumer & International segment. We believe the new structure would better position our businesses for the future and now that we've completed the reorganization and launched Disney+, are more confident than ever in that decision. I am enormously proud of what we have accomplished in a relatively short period of time and believe we are now well positioned to not only withstand the disruptive forces of technology but thrive in today's increasingly dynamic media environment. And with that, I will turn the call over to Christine to talk more about our performance in the quarter, and then I'll be back to take your questions.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.53. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start, as evidenced by our first quarter results, and as Bob discussed, we are incredibly pleased with the launch of Disney+ and the positive consumer response we have received to-date. In terms of our fiscal first quarter results, our Studios creative momentum continues to deliver outstanding financial performance. Operating income was up significantly compared to Q1 last year, driven by growth and worldwide theatrical and higher TVs SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio. The actual results reflect the performance of Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of SkyWalker in the quarter compared to theatrical releases last year, which included Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns and The Nutcracker. Higher legacy TV SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. The increases in our legacy theatrical and TV SVOD businesses were partially offset by a $50 million loss at the 21CF studio business, as operating income from TV SVOD distribution was more than offset by an operating loss at Worldwide Theatrical, and general and administrative costs. At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher results at Consumer Products and at our domestic Parks and Resorts, partially offset by lower results at our international Parks and Resorts. Consumer Products operating income was up 25% due to growth in merchandise licensing as a result of strong revenue growth from sales of Frozen and Star Wars merchandise, both of which benefited from theatrical releases in the quarter. Revenue at domestic Parks and Experiences was up an impressive 10% in the quarter, driven by higher guest spending and to a lesser extent increases in attendance at our domestic Parks and Resorts. Operating income at domestic Parks and Experiences was up 6% as the flow through from strong revenue growth was dampened by operational expenses associated with Galaxy's Edge and significant labor expense growth due to higher wages as a result of collective bargaining agreements. Attendance at our domestic Parks was up 2% in the first quarter and per capita guest spending was up 10% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 4%, and occupancy was 92%. So far this quarter domestic resort reservations are pacing up 4% compared to this time last year, and book rates at our domestic hotels are currently pacing up 10%. At our International Operations, operating income was lower in Q1 as improved results at Shanghai Disney Resort were more than offset by a decline of about $80 million at Hong Kong Disneyland due to lower attendance and hotel occupancy. Hong Kong Disneyland results in the quarter are consistent with the outlook we communicated last quarter. However, the recent closure of our parks in both Shanghai and Hong Kong, due to the ongoing Corona virus situation will negatively impact second quarter and full year results. The current closure is taking place during the quarter in which we typically see strong attendance and occupancy levels due to the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday. The precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures and how quickly we can resume normal operations. At Shanghai Disney Resort, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an adverse impact to second quarter operating income of approximately $135 million, assuming the park is closed for two months during Q2. At Hong Kong Disneyland, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an additional adverse impact to operating income of about $40 million for the second quarter. As I discussed last quarter, we were already seeing a significant decrease in visitation to Hong Kong Disneyland from China, and other parts of Asia. So in aggregate, we estimate these two factors could result in a decline in Hong Kong Disneyland's Operating income of about $145 million for the second quarter. Again, this assumes the resort is closed for two months. Turning to Media Networks, Operating income was up in the first quarter due to increases at both Cable and Broadcasting. Higher cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, partially offset by a decrease at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs, primarily driven by contractual rate increases at NFL, college football and the launch of the ACC Network in addition to lower ad revenue. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was down 4.5% in the first quarter due to lower average viewership primarily for NBA and college football regular-season games, which more than offset an increase in viewership from Monday night football. On note, that when you look at ad revenue across all ESPN domestic ad platforms, which include digital and addressable advertising revenue reported in our DTCI segment, ESPN's total domestic ad revenue in the first quarter was roughly comparable to the prior year. So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing up 2% compared to last year. At Broadcasting, higher results in the quarter were due to the consolidation of 21CF and a benefit from new accounting guidance which is explained further in our press release and 10-Q filings, partially offset by lower results from our legacy operations. Results at our legacy Broadcasting operations were lower in the quarter as higher affiliate revenue was more than offset by lower ad revenue, a difficult program sales comp at ABC Studios and higher network programming and production costs. Lower program sales at ABC Studios reflect the prior year sale of Marvel's The Punisher, during Q1 last year and no comparable sale in the first quarter this year. Total Broadcasting ad revenue was lower in the quarter, driven by lower political advertising at our owned stations and a decline at the ABC Network. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 19% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 14 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 2-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which was aided by about a 2.5 point benefit from the launch of the ACC Network. Operating losses at our Direct-to-Consumer and International segment increased in the quarter driven by cost incurred to support the successful launch of Disney+, the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu, and higher programing costs at ESPN Plus. These operating losses were partially offset by the consolidation of the 21CF international cable businesses. Results at our Direct-to-Consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of $845 million, which was in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $900 million in operating losses for the second quarter and we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, specifically Disney+, which will launch in a number of European markets late in the second quarter, and the consolidation of Hulu to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $520 million. As Bob mentioned, Disney+ had 28.6 million paid subscribers as of yesterday, an increase of 2.1 million since the end of the first quarter. In the near-term, we expect subscriber growth to come primarily from outside the U.S., with the next meaningful phase of domestic subscriber growth likely to coincide with the release later this calendar year of highly anticipated original content, including episodic series from Marvel and Season 2 of The Mandalorian. Turning to the elimination segment, revenue and profit eliminations were significantly higher in Q1, driven primarily by the inter-segment content sales from the Studio and Media Networks to DTCI. I'll note that our 10-Q this quarter contains additional detail on the general structure and accounting treatment of the various types of inter-segment content transactions reflected in our segment results. Lastly, we continue to make progress on realizing the value of the 21CF acquisition. The businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of inter-segment eliminations, contributed approximately $590 million in segment operating income in the first quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out inter-segment eliminations, resulted in a positive impact total segment operating income of about $300 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF, and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a total dilutive impact on our Q1 EPS before purchase accounting of $0.27 per share, and we estimate the acquisition of 21st Century Fox in the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu will have a dilutive impact on our Q2 earnings per share before purchase accounting of about $0.25 per share. We are still on track for the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to (multiple speakers) take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Christine. And operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks, Bob. I have 2Q and Disney+. First one is stepping back a bit, what were the biggest surprises or learnings that you had post-launch. When you looked at what you had accomplished, and then after those learnings, how did you or what have you adjusted in terms of your launch plans or content spending plans after reviewing the first two months of this product?\nRobert Iger: Well, I don't know if you call this a surprise, but certainly it's a learning because we didn't know until we launched. But we've been heartened by the fact that there has been basically consumption of a broad array of product across all of our brands. That is not just about original programming or not just about the Disney library, it's really about everything including original shorts and older shorts, and legacy Disney Channel shows and of course, the library led by musicals and recent theatrical releases and Mandalorian, but it has been very broad-based, and I mentioned earlier that about, it was, 65% of the people who watch Mandalorian, watch at least 10 other things on the service, so this was not about any one thing. 50% of people who use the service have watched movies as a -- for instance. So, with that in mind, we feel that validates the collection of those brands and a blend of product that includes obviously, the library or legacy TV and films of short-form and long-form, and then original programming. The trajectory in terms of our investment in original programming on the service is roughly the same as it would have been whereas it was before we launched. We haven't really changed that that much. Clearly, the original shows that we decide to invest and led by the Mandalorian have worked, and we knew when we launched that we were launching with a modest amount of original programming, and that it would build over time. So, as we look ahead, we're really comfortable with the volume that -- of the product that we are creating and don't really feel that there is much that we have to adjust to right now. We have just as a - for instance, we have a few Star Wars series in varying stages of production and development. We have the three Marvel series that were announced and I think there are seven other Marvel series that are in varying stages of development or pre-production, and there are a number of Disney originals. We have Disney original movies coming. Very pleased with them, by the way, and then we have a new one coming, Timmy Failure is a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, for instance. So we've got a - I think a great blend and don't feel a real need to adjust, and I think the best thing about it all is that the decision that we made to go with quality and not just volume is working. So, the second part of the question?\nMichael Nathanson: Okay, that was covered\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: One more question on Direct-to-Consumer and then NFL. On Hulu, could you - Bob, you said you're going to take it internationally, you've alluded to that before. How long will it take you to get some of these rights back around the globe, and can you give us any thoughts on timing because the bundle strategy is obviously working here. And then on NFL, can you give us an update on your thoughts on that in terms of - well if anything you can timing, but also placement of NFL on ABC versus ESPN, and ESPN Plus?\nRobert Iger: We are working up a plan to take Hulu internationally. We actually have a lot of specifics around it, but we've decided that the priority needs to be Disney+. We are launching, as I mentioned on the call across multiple territories in Western Europe later in March, and then in India on March 29 and it's going to continue to roll out across the world going into 2021 including Latin America, and we feel that we need to concentrate on those launches in the marketing and the creation of product for those, and then come in with Hulu right after or soon after that. So, we don't have specifics, except we do plan to begin rolling Hulu out, I'd say probably in 2021 internationally that is after the Disney+ launch. On the NFL side, look, it's very early to speculate. I think the ratings for the NFL suggest that, while there's a lot of disruption and there is a fair amount of erosion and you see people basically watching programs from multiple new sources and creating more competition for the traditional linear networks. The live sports has held up really well, led of course by the NFL. So, our interest in the NFL remains very strong and there have been only preliminary discussions and nothing more, and it would be premature for me to give you any more detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: Bob, there's a lot of discussion in the market about the relative popularity of Disney's brands and IP outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S., and obviously we're all going to now digest the results you just reported. But how do you think we should be thinking about the subscriber opportunity as you launch these new markets in the March quarter in Europe relative to what we've seen so far in the U.S., and what can you tell us about the India launch, and how you plan to price that and bundle it with Hotstar VIP? How big is Hotstar VIP? Can you just talk about the go-to-market in India since that's a market where you're going in with a really unique strategic position given the Star business?\nRobert Iger: Well, first of all, those brands are global brands, each one of them, including Star Wars, which maybe what you're alluding to Ben. They have varying strengths in different markets, Disney is probably the strongest on a consistent basis across the world, but they all have raised brand affinity and brand interest in all of them, which I think is one of the things that is a strong selling point for us into markets. So, I don't really think that, well, we necessarily need to do much adjusting as it relates to the product that has been designed for the U.S. except to make sure, obviously, that the programs are dubbed in the local language properly and are high quality. And secondly, that we have enough local programming, either to meet local quotas or simply to address local cases. One of the interesting things by the way about Star Wars and The Mandalorian, because there has been some things written after The Rise of Skywalker, that the popularity of Star Wars in certain international markets where there's Star Wars and certainly in - and international markets has never caught on. One of the reasons for that is that there isn't a Star Wars legacy in many of these markets, China being a main one, where people didn't grow up on that franchise or that brand. So when they tuned into, or heard about the Skywalker legacy, there was too much that had already gone in the past that was not familiar to them and they didn't really want to get on board late. That's not true with Mandalorian, because Mandalorian is even though it's based on, obviously, certain Star Wars elements, characters in places, you don't have to know anything about the history of Star Wars in terms of an access point or in terms of your interest. So anyway, we feel great about the popularity of our brands. Interesting the Disney brand globally has never been more popular. The other thing I want to say is that the brand studies that we've seen or brand research that we've seen in the United States suggests that interest and affinity in the Disney Brand has actually risen nicely, thanks to Disney+ particularly among young people. I think a lot of that has to do with the relevance of the platform, the technology, the manner of presentation. I think it's a loud statement about what's going on in the world today in terms of consumer tastes, particularly young people, which is why the demographics of Hulu were substantially younger than the demographics on some of our peers in the linear networks, et cetera, et cetera. In India, we're going to launch bundled with Hotstar directly bundled meaning it's Disney+ Hotstar as a product. We're not giving specifics about price at this point, but expect that there'll be two primary products brought into India. One will be more premium in nature that will include the entire library, so with the original programming and the other one will be more basic that will have the library and not the original programming. Priced for the market and launched at a very peak period of time, so the IPL, the Cricket League. And so, we think it's an opportune moment, we take advantage of the presence of Star in the market and the millions of subscribers that they also have, we take advantage of the sports tie-in, and we use the interface and the technology that includes the billing that already exists to launch a service, we believe, under very, very optimal circumstances.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAlexia Quadrani: Just following up on your color or your commentary on Disney+. Is there any more you can share with us in terms of what the - where the subscribers came from meaning and sort of like what type of subscriber they are, meaning like how many maybe a year-long or multi-year subscriber deal versus month-to-month, and sort of how many sort of came in for use versus on wholesale partnerships like Verizon and such. I don't know how much color you can share there? And then my second question is just on the studio, where you've had just incredible success there and another record year,'19, I guess your conduct - your conviction of that success can continue, especially when you're taking account kind of pipeline now from the Fox Studios?\nRobert Iger: First of all, regarding Disney+, and the fact that the ARPU by the end of the quarter was $5.56 on a $6.99 subscription suggests that while there were discounts in the market in the packaging that existed enabled consumers to buy in at lower prices. We did extremely well, basically with the Direct-to-Consumer Package, and ARPU that was higher and so the 26.5 million and subscribers came roughly 50% directly through Disneyplus.com, for instance, where not only weren't we revenue sharing with others, but a lot of those subscribers, or many of them may have bought a year-long service or even a three-year, many of them bought basically the month for the full - for the full price. About 20% of those subscribers came from Verizon, and the rest came from the variety of other services, that is stripping the app, and including the iTunes platform. So we were actually very pleased with the diversity of, basically, routes that people took to get to us and extremely pleased with the ARPU. Now also understand that the vast majority came from domestic because we only launched in a couple of territories, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands and Canada with this, and so, these are mostly domestic subs. But, I think it's all very, very positive story in terms of the - the manner in which people bought this and as I said earlier, the ARPU. And the other thing that we noted that was that the bundle with ESPN and with Hulu was very helpful in terms of lowering churn rates. And as I said, in my remarks, both the conversion from free-to-pay, as well as the churn rates were much better than we expected they would be - much better than we had estimated they would be before we launched. And I think, again, that's the result of - that starts with the product and I think the end of - the user interface also got incredibly high marks in terms of the ease of use, the easy navigation, the quality of the product, the value of the brands and the price point which we can't ignore, a very accessible price point, priced purposely because of the brand and our desire to be as accessible as possible on a broad basis. Regarding the studio, look, a $11 billion plus Box Office year from the Disney studio alone is not something we're likely to repeat right away, but as we look ahead, we're extremely pleased with the long-term prospects for our studio and the slate. I could name a number of titles, but this year, for instance, we have to Pixar titles with Onward and Soul in the marketplace. We've got a couple of really strong Disney branded Jungle Cruise and Mulan. We have obviously Marvel with Black Widow, initial at first, and then Eternals at the rest of the - at the end of the year and you can imagine, a lot of development from all of those. On the Star Wars front, were it - as I had mentioned in previous calls, we're taking a bit of a hiatus in terms of theatrical release, we finished the nine-episode Skywalker Saga, and we're developing both television and features. The priority in the next few years is television with The Mandalorian Season 2 coming in October, and then more coming from The Mandalorian thereafter, including the possibility of infusing it with more characters and the possibility of taking those characters in their own direction in terms of series. And then, we have a prequel to Rogue One in an Obi Wan series, also in development. So the priority for Star Wars in the short-term is going to be, I'll call it television for Disney+, and then we will have more to say about development of theatrical soon after that. But 2020 is not going to be the same as 2019 for the studio. But as we still expect a very strong year, and given the franchises and the talent that we both work with, and have working for us, we are confident that the studio is going to continue to be a strong driver of operating income for the company, both on the movie front, but also as a great supplier of product both original and secondary market for Disney+ and for Hulu, by the way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Hodulik: Bob, couple of questions, follow-ups on the DTC business. First of all, on Disney+, the model definitely, it seems to be holding up, you talked about, ARPU churn, content spend, the target is for 60 million to 90 million subs, and 24 million in profitability, because of this, we're halfway to the goals, in the model, the metrics seem to be hitting. Can we expect the profitability to come in sooner than the 24 million number? And then, if we just focus on the U.S., I think you guys gave guidance for 20 million to 30 million subs in the U.S., and again, you're sort of at the high-end, or around the high-end of that guidance. What are you seeing in terms of the TAM, are you just - is the TAM bigger than you thought and could that potentially be the case in the rest of world or are you just - just penetrating the market - as we then thought?\nRobert Iger: I think, John, you touched - when you touched on it related to the U.S. I was actually going to bring up the 60 million to 90 million included obviously two-thirds of that subs that we were going to get from outside the United States, where except for just a few markets we've not even launched yet. So, it's far too early for us after, basically, a quarter and a little bit more under our belt to change our guidance, having not launched in any of the big international markets yet. What we know about those markets, not in any way pour cold water on them, because we know that those brands are strong in the markets, and this product is already working. The interest in streaming, in general, in those markets, isn't as high as it has been in the United States. I'm talking about across the world. So we have probably more of a marketing effort and I'd say, more of a challenge to launch in those markets, not that those markets haven't been already seeded with streaming, we know Netflix has done extremely well Internationally. But we're just beginning there, and I think it's just premature for us to take our guidance up. What we do know, of course, is that we have reached a number in the United States that since you did the math that would suggest that we're at the number that we predicted we would be in year five, just after a very short period of time, and I don't know whether that is a statement about the total available market or the quality of the product or both, or the price. It is just the way I think a number of factors that I've touched upon, and I just - I'll go over them one more time. Those brands are extreme - not only are they high quality, It is a very unique product. I was asked earlier on CNBC about whether I felt threatened by competition, there's obviously more competition coming into the space, But there isn't any competition that is like ours, like our product, because of the investments that we've made in those franchises and the quality of the product that we've made over the years and we're continuing to make. So we're very differentiated, we're extremely well priced. And we created a service tech - from a technical basis and the user interface basis, that is really working. There's an elegance to it and an ease, and we feel great about it. So our - as we look ahead at that guidance, and I can't say that we won't change in at some point, but it's - we don't believe that it would be prudent for us to adjust it at this point, and we have a long way to go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nDoug Mitchelson: I am going to keep going on Disney+ but, Bob, I think congratulations are - in order on the success of the service, so far. A couple of things, in terms of consumption patterns for the Disney+ service, is this a service households are using every day or they're using every week, and any sort of issues or thoughts around consumption levels after the initial sign-up period is - where people can then leave the service, a bunch of them starts to fade after that or did you find that it stayed relatively level? And I am interested, Bob, you talked a lot about in India, but interested about the launch in Europe broadly and contrasting it with the first series of markets. So is the content that is available on the service in the U.S., also, sort of the same content available in Europe, and any sort of differences or nuances in go-to-market, marketing and distribution efforts in any of those countries that we should be aware of as we try to gauge how successful Europe might be? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: We measured - in terms of the - I'll call it engagement, we've measured recency, which is essentially how many people are - used it recently, are active users on a weekly basis, that's extremely high. We measure frequency, which is a number of times people stream per week since launch and we measure engagement, which is basically how many hours people have streamed on a weekly or basis per subscriber, and I don't think we should get into all those details right now, except to say that in all three cases, recency, the percentage of people that it - are weekly active users, very, very high. The same thing is true with frequency the number of average days that they actually use the service, and again this is something that we've seen over both - basically, the first quarter. I think these numbers probably relate to the first quarter and not necessarily since December 28, that's also very high and the engagement, or we were looking at multiple hours a week stream, per subscriber. I can give you that now, that's in the six hours to seven hours a week range, very, very high. Now Christmas was in there, time when a lot of families were off, that may have actually skewed that a little bit high, but again we're seeing consumption, I'll call it across the board, and in sum, it is quite interesting to us. Pixar has done extremely well, as a, for instance, including their shorts, musicals are doing very, very well. Obviously, great interest in some of the big titles that have recently come on the service. Toy Story 4 just came on. I think, Rise of Skywalker later in the year. Lion King came on, Avengers, I mentioned Endgame. It's kind of, I guess, and without, in anyway, sounding like we're bragging, it validates the concept of putting those brands together and collecting library. As we look to the rest of the world, there really isn't anything to cite in terms of encumbrances that would be an issue. We're in relatively good shape there. I'd say that we have some work to do in terms of local product, because there are quotas in certain markets that we have to meet. But the universal appeal of - of this product is - is pretty strong. You do have to factor in that, in some markets, there's lower broadband penetration. And so you don't have the total available - the total available market is not as high as it is in other markets. Netherlands was very high. That's why we decided the launch there. South Korea is very high. But there are other markets, obviously, India being one, that you have lower broadband. But huge opportunities - huge opportunities for us, Internationally, and that's where that Disney name and that family nature of the product, I think, will resonate extremely well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nTodd Juenger: One quick one on Hulu, as far as I could and then, I'd love to talk about the Parks for little change of break here. So just on Hulu - on the Hulu SVOD ARPU, that $13-plus number, struck - stuck out to us, it's - it's even higher than the non-advertising Hulu - SVOD list price. So just wondering if you could share what's going on with advertising ARPU on the Hulu SVOD, it must be a big number. And anything you could share there would be helpful to understand. And then on the Parks, a couple of really minor ones, and then a bigger one. Christine, if you could remind us, for the U.S. domestic Parks, what percent of attendance comes from international visitation, and particularly from Asia, and if you're thinking about that at all, when you think about the near-term effects of the virus and the travel curtailments there? Longer term, Bob, I hope you'll accept this question, I'm not - just wondering how you think about the growth function for parks. It's a question we get from investors all the time it's super important. We'd love if you just share your thoughts, because I think what investors look at is so much of revenue and income growth has come from increased spend per guest in the form of either pricing or merchandise and food volumes. The question we wrestle with is gee how long can that keep going, right? Is there some point at which either your consumer gets priced out or - just competition sets in or that sort of thing and [indiscernible] sets in. So without asking for formal guidance, I just loved - is there still more opportunity on the yield side or how long can you push that, are there other ways the parks can grow over time? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay thanks, Todd.\nRobert Iger: I think we go first because we want to do is Hulu SVOD ARPU?\nChristine McCarthy: Hulu SVOD ARPU is very strong. The ad-supported, the product is priced at $5.99 and - but the ad-supported part of the equation, it makes the ARPU come out even higher than the ad free. Most of the subscribers subscribe to the ad-supported. So that's a good balance of the ARPUs when you stack them up next to each other. Let me take the domestic park question on international visitation. We have typically run in the 18% to 22% range for guests outside of the U.S. We're at the low-end of that range, maybe a tick below right now because some of the South American markets, because of the disruption in those economies have had lower visitation. The two I would cite, would be - that won't be a surprise to anyone, would be Brazil and Argentina. In general, the parks do not have a significant amount of visitation from Asia. When you look at Walt Disney World, no Asian market even factors into the top five, and the top one being the UK, which I think everyone knows that. And then we have Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Argentina, that is for the East Coast, Walt Disney World. And then when you look at Disneyland, Canada is a very strong market for us, no surprise, just given proximity to the West Coast markets of Vancouver. And then, we also have Mexico, Australia, and the only market that even breaks into the top five would be Japan and it's actually a very low single-digit number for Disneyland. And so far, there has been no evidence that there is any impact on the intent to visit, or people fulfilling reservations or commitments from Coronavirus.\nRobert Iger: And regarding other growth possibilities for the parks, it's really going to be a blend. We continue to invest capital to build out new attractions, new hotels, new restaurants. We've announced many different projects. Obviously, we just opened Rise of the Resistance and that's done extremely well, not just in terms of attendance but per capita spending has been quite high. We have a variety of different Marvel projects underway. The Avengers project in California, and a number of Marvel related things in Florida, including a Guardians of the Galaxy E-ticket attraction. So, we're going to continue to build out against the Company's most popular, or using the most popular franchises. And as I mentioned, build out hotels as well. We just opened one Riviera Resort we're opening one in Florida. We have a Star Wars themed hotel coming, a lot of activity there. We will look for international opportunities as well. They still exist, and obviously, the virus has slowed things down a bit, but we expect that when that passes that we will start looking expansively in other territories. And of course, lastly there is a yield story to tell and that's been exceptional that is a combination of things. But clearly, far more sophisticated, more thoughtful pricing strategy has helped a lot. Taking advantage of peak periods and pricing leverage but also making the parks more accessible in non-peak periods for others at substantially more accessible prices.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nSteven Cahall: Just two quick ones but maybe first on Disney+. It seems like you priced this exactly right, given the market response. I would think you could kind of make life harder on some of your more expensive streaming competition like Netflix or HBO by keeping the price low for as long as you can and keeping that engagement with customers. So just kind of curious how you're thinking about the price of Disney+ long-term does it go up over time or do you sort of keep it as it is? And then, Christine, just wondering if you could maybe give us a little more color on how to think about the studio for the year, there is just a lot of moving parts there. I know theatrical is impossible to predict, but then you've also got the synergy with the Fox Studios and the transfer pricing. So, how do we kind of think about the income production of the studio this year given all those different pieces? Thanks.\nRobert Iger: Yes Steve, we haven't had a conversation about price since we launched except that we felt that our pricing strategy has worked. We really are not focused right now on price at all. We believed all along that we would have an opportunity to address pricing as we added more content, really original content, and the price-value relationship went up to the consumer, but it's not a priority of ours right now. We're still as we\u2019re very new with this. So, I think it would be premature for us to start talking about, and don't expect anything in the near term, very near term from a price increase perspective. Christine, you want to take the question about the studio?\nChristine McCarthy: Yes let me take that. As Bob already mentioned our studio, our legacy Disney studio had nothing short of a truly phenomenal year six movies, over $1 billion in the global box office. That is an incredibly hard - seven movies over sorry about that. seven movies over $1 billion, that's an incredibly hard comp on a year-over-year. So, we will still - we still believe that our studio will be very successful this year. And we have confidence in their content resonating with consumers on a global basis. Bob already mentioned some of the big movies that we have coming out, and we feel really good about those. As it relates to transfer pricing of content, the studio definitely will benefit from the content sales to DTCI. The Pay 1 windows and we had quite a few movies come out in fiscal 2019, that will make it into the Pay 1 window in fiscal 2020, and that will also have a positive impact on the studio.\nOperator: And our final question comes from David Miller with Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.\nDavid Miller: Bob, as you know, I've covered you guys for a long time, and I've covered the theaters for a long time. And I've probably heard you say maybe a dozen times over the last four years that you are 100% committed to the theatrical window, going forward, despite the launch of Disney+. The problem is that, and I would never accuse you of being disingenuous, you know that but the problem is that the market doesn't really believe that given 52-week lows on excuse me AMC and Cinemark and to some extent Marcus. So on this call, would you be willing to kind of recommit to the theatrical window or I should say, what would you have to say going forward about your overall commitment to the theatrical window given your market leadership in that regard? Thanks so much.\nRobert Iger: The theatrical window is working for this company and we have no plans to adjust it for our business. Your comment about how those companies are faring on the market, I think, maybe is a reflection of how the other movie companies are positioning their films and their business we're not the only movie company. We are the biggest Box Office, but we're not the only movie company and I suspect that it's not due to us or either a lack of conviction on our part or any suspicion that we might not be - that we might not be telling the truth.\nDavid Miller: Right.\nRobert Iger: But we're not - it's working for us, and we have no plans in the foreseeable future to change it that requires.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, David, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Note that a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we referred to on this call to equivalent GAAP measures can be found on our Investor Relations website. In our remarks we provided estimates of the performance of certain 21CF assets in periods of the prior year.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Iger",
            "content": "Thanks Low, and good afternoon everyone. We've had a great quarter and a very productive start to the year, but before I talk about the quarter, let me begin with the events in Asia related to the Coronavirus. Certainly our hearts go out to all those affected by this devastating outbreak, including the thousands of people who work for us in the region. In line with numerous prevention efforts taking place across China, we've temporarily closed our parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and we will continue to closely monitor this public health crisis. Christine will have details about the developing financial impact in her comments. Turning to the quarter, since our last call, our studio released two more films that exceeded $1 billion each at the global Box Office. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which concluded the nine episode Skywalker saga; and Frozen 2 which became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time with more than $1.4 billion in global sales, surpassing the original Frozen, which held the record since 2014. The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2 along with Captain Marvel, Aladdin, The Lion King, Toy Story 4, and the biggest movie of all time, Avengers: Endgame contributed to a total global Box Office for the year for Disney of more than $11 billion, shattering the previous industry record of $7.6 billion set by us in 2016. Many of these films are already available exclusively on Disney+, and the remainder will soon join the service following their home entertainment window. On the parks side, we're thrilled by the overwhelming response to our newest attraction Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, which opened in Orlando in early December, and in Anaheim just a few weeks ago. Our Imagineers and the Design Team at Lucasfilm did an absolutely phenomenal job, and it's one of the most immersive, ambitious, and technologically advanced attractions ever created for a Disney park, and it's elevating storytelling to exciting new levels. Not surprising, Rise of the Resistance has quickly become a fan favorite at both parks and Galaxy's Edge has been a great success at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Of course, the high point of the quarter was the highly anticipated launch of our streaming service, Disney+. Thanks in large part to our incredible portfolio of great brands, the outstanding content from our creative engines and a robust technology platform, the launch of Disney+ has been enormously successful exceeding even our greatest expectations. As we reported previously, we had more than 10 million sign-ups for Disney+ by the end of day 1, and we ended the quarter with 26.5 million paid subscribers. Since then, consumers have continued to sign up for the service directly at disneyplus.com through Verizon, which offers a free year of Disney+ to many of its customers at no additional cost, as well as through other distributors including Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony, and Roku. We recognize there's a lot of interest in this new business, and we wanted to give you some additional context. So, I'm pleased to say that as of Monday, we were at 28.6 million paid subscribers. Going forward, it's our intention to announce subs as of the end of the quarter that we're reporting on. One additional note on sign-ups for Disney+, although we will not provide specifics, is that we are pleased to report that both conversion from free to pay and churn rates were better than we expected. We believe the subscriber growth to-date and the overall reaction to Disney+ reflects a variety of factors that include the uniqueness of the service and excellent user interface, and the high quality of our brands and content. In fact, we are seeing the four-quadrant appeal of our brands reflected in our subscriber numbers as well. On the content side, consumers have enthusiastically embraced the exceptional offering of classic movies and shorts from our studio, including Moana and Frozen. Disney Channel series like Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, recent theatrical releases like The Lion King, which became available on the service on January 28. The Simpsons is also quite popular with all 30 previous seasons available. And our growing slate of original content is also of great interest to our subscribers, especially The Mandalorian which has quickly become a bonafide hit and a cultural phenomenon. Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a certain child in The Mandalorian, who has taken the world by storm. I do believe the sensational response to this new character says so much about Disney+ and our company's ability to connect with audiences. We know there is great anticipation for the substantial array of Baby Yoda consumer products hitting the market in the coming months. We'll continue to add high quality content as a service that includes Frozen 2, and Episode 9, The Rise of Skywalker. Many of you probably saw our Super Bowl spot featuring three original new Marvel series for Disney+. Loki, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which will premiere on the service in August, and WandaVision, which will debut in December. These same characters and actors from the Marvel cinematic universe along with events from these new shows will factor into future Marvel films as we integrate storytelling across these platforms, all under the Marvel Studio banner. We also have the highly anticipated return of The Mandalorian in October and multiple new series from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Nat Geo. So, there's a lot to look forward to. Although our volume will increase, we remain focused on providing quality content from our core franchises and brands, not just quantity as we continue to build our portfolio. And the creative community has taken notice as well, many have expressed interest in joining Disney+'s roster of extraordinary talent. The next big priority is launching Disney+ in numerous international markets, starting in Western Europe on March 24 when we will launch in the U.K. and Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, and Austria. Additional markets including Belgium, the Nordics, and Portugal will follow this summer. In December, we signed a deal with Canal+, the leading pay-TV provider in France. We're currently in talks with several other potential distribution partners throughout the region. We're also excited to announce that we will be launching Disney+ in India through our Hotstar service on March 29, at the beginning of the Indian Premier League Cricket season. We will be rebranding our existing Hotstar VIP and Premium subscription tiers to Disney+ Hotstar. We see this as a great opportunity to use the proven platform of Hotstar to launch the new Disney+ service in one of the most populous countries and fastest-growing economies in the world. Looking across our portfolio of Direct-to-Consumer businesses, we're also pleased with the growth of ESPN plus. We ended the quarter with 6.6 million paid subscribers, and as of Monday, we were at 7.6 million. We've been especially happy with a number of partnerships, particularly with the UFC and the recent McGregor Ceron fight brought in about a 1 million pay-per-view purchases and a 0.5 million new subscribers. We will continue to add content to the service on an opportunistic basis. At Hulu, we recently announced that we will be reorganizing the business to more closely integrat it into our Direct-to-Consumer segment in order to operate more efficiently and effectively as we look to expand our domestic consumer base, as well as our presence outside the U.S. With respect to subscriber numbers, we remain optimistic about the future of the service. Hulu ended the quarter with 30.4 million paid subs and as of Monday, the number was 30.7 million. During our last earnings call, we announced the launch of FX on Hulu, which will be available to all Hulu subscribers at no additional cost. Beginning next month, Hulu will be the exclusive streaming service for all new FX Original programming. FX on Hulu will also offer in-season streaming as well as back seasons for most current and library series. We view this as a fantastic opportunity to expose FX as exceptional content to a broader audience, while also making available to consumers in new ways. We believe there is tremendous appetite for our content and the goal of FX on Hulu is to expand our reach to include those viewers who are not linear pay TV subscribers, and that includes many of Hulu's young and highly engaged streaming audience. The addition of FX as programming is a step in the direction of continued increased investment in high quality programing for Hulu, which will be developed and produced by our existing creative engines. It's all been challenging for a company to pivot in a new strategic direction particularly when it involves navigating between established and emerging business models, but since we announced our intention to shift our strategy, we have made an extraordinary amount of progress. This included a strategic reorganization of our Company, creating a Direct-to-Consumer & International segment. We believe the new structure would better position our businesses for the future and now that we've completed the reorganization and launched Disney+, are more confident than ever in that decision. I am enormously proud of what we have accomplished in a relatively short period of time and believe we are now well positioned to not only withstand the disruptive forces of technology but thrive in today's increasingly dynamic media environment. And with that, I will turn the call over to Christine to talk more about our performance in the quarter, and then I'll be back to take your questions. Well, I don't know if you call this a surprise, but certainly it's a learning because we didn't know until we launched. But we've been heartened by the fact that there has been basically consumption of a broad array of product across all of our brands. That is not just about original programming or not just about the Disney library, it's really about everything including original shorts and older shorts, and legacy Disney Channel shows and of course, the library led by musicals and recent theatrical releases and Mandalorian, but it has been very broad-based, and I mentioned earlier that about, it was, 65% of the people who watch Mandalorian, watch at least 10 other things on the service, so this was not about any one thing. 50% of people who use the service have watched movies as a -- for instance. So, with that in mind, we feel that validates the collection of those brands and a blend of product that includes obviously, the library or legacy TV and films of short-form and long-form, and then original programming. The trajectory in terms of our investment in original programming on the service is roughly the same as it would have been whereas it was before we launched. We haven't really changed that that much. Clearly, the original shows that we decide to invest and led by the Mandalorian have worked, and we knew when we launched that we were launching with a modest amount of original programming, and that it would build over time. So, as we look ahead, we're really comfortable with the volume that -- of the product that we are creating and don't really feel that there is much that we have to adjust to right now. We have just as a - for instance, we have a few Star Wars series in varying stages of production and development. We have the three Marvel series that were announced and I think there are seven other Marvel series that are in varying stages of development or pre-production, and there are a number of Disney originals. We have Disney original movies coming. Very pleased with them, by the way, and then we have a new one coming, Timmy Failure is a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, for instance. So we've got a - I think a great blend and don't feel a real need to adjust, and I think the best thing about it all is that the decision that we made to go with quality and not just volume is working. So, the second part of the question? We are working up a plan to take Hulu internationally. We actually have a lot of specifics around it, but we've decided that the priority needs to be Disney+. We are launching, as I mentioned on the call across multiple territories in Western Europe later in March, and then in India on March 29 and it's going to continue to roll out across the world going into 2021 including Latin America, and we feel that we need to concentrate on those launches in the marketing and the creation of product for those, and then come in with Hulu right after or soon after that. So, we don't have specifics, except we do plan to begin rolling Hulu out, I'd say probably in 2021 internationally that is after the Disney+ launch. On the NFL side, look, it's very early to speculate. I think the ratings for the NFL suggest that, while there's a lot of disruption and there is a fair amount of erosion and you see people basically watching programs from multiple new sources and creating more competition for the traditional linear networks. The live sports has held up really well, led of course by the NFL. So, our interest in the NFL remains very strong and there have been only preliminary discussions and nothing more, and it would be premature for me to give you any more detail. Well, first of all, those brands are global brands, each one of them, including Star Wars, which maybe what you're alluding to Ben. They have varying strengths in different markets, Disney is probably the strongest on a consistent basis across the world, but they all have raised brand affinity and brand interest in all of them, which I think is one of the things that is a strong selling point for us into markets. So, I don't really think that, well, we necessarily need to do much adjusting as it relates to the product that has been designed for the U.S. except to make sure, obviously, that the programs are dubbed in the local language properly and are high quality. And secondly, that we have enough local programming, either to meet local quotas or simply to address local cases. One of the interesting things by the way about Star Wars and The Mandalorian, because there has been some things written after The Rise of Skywalker, that the popularity of Star Wars in certain international markets where there's Star Wars and certainly in - and international markets has never caught on. One of the reasons for that is that there isn't a Star Wars legacy in many of these markets, China being a main one, where people didn't grow up on that franchise or that brand. So when they tuned into, or heard about the Skywalker legacy, there was too much that had already gone in the past that was not familiar to them and they didn't really want to get on board late. That's not true with Mandalorian, because Mandalorian is even though it's based on, obviously, certain Star Wars elements, characters in places, you don't have to know anything about the history of Star Wars in terms of an access point or in terms of your interest. So anyway, we feel great about the popularity of our brands. Interesting the Disney brand globally has never been more popular. The other thing I want to say is that the brand studies that we've seen or brand research that we've seen in the United States suggests that interest and affinity in the Disney Brand has actually risen nicely, thanks to Disney+ particularly among young people. I think a lot of that has to do with the relevance of the platform, the technology, the manner of presentation. I think it's a loud statement about what's going on in the world today in terms of consumer tastes, particularly young people, which is why the demographics of Hulu were substantially younger than the demographics on some of our peers in the linear networks, et cetera, et cetera. In India, we're going to launch bundled with Hotstar directly bundled meaning it's Disney+ Hotstar as a product. We're not giving specifics about price at this point, but expect that there'll be two primary products brought into India. One will be more premium in nature that will include the entire library, so with the original programming and the other one will be more basic that will have the library and not the original programming. Priced for the market and launched at a very peak period of time, so the IPL, the Cricket League. And so, we think it's an opportune moment, we take advantage of the presence of Star in the market and the millions of subscribers that they also have, we take advantage of the sports tie-in, and we use the interface and the technology that includes the billing that already exists to launch a service, we believe, under very, very optimal circumstances. First of all, regarding Disney+, and the fact that the ARPU by the end of the quarter was $5.56 on a $6.99 subscription suggests that while there were discounts in the market in the packaging that existed enabled consumers to buy in at lower prices. We did extremely well, basically with the Direct-to-Consumer Package, and ARPU that was higher and so the 26.5 million and subscribers came roughly 50% directly through Disneyplus.com, for instance, where not only weren't we revenue sharing with others, but a lot of those subscribers, or many of them may have bought a year-long service or even a three-year, many of them bought basically the month for the full - for the full price. About 20% of those subscribers came from Verizon, and the rest came from the variety of other services, that is stripping the app, and including the iTunes platform. So we were actually very pleased with the diversity of, basically, routes that people took to get to us and extremely pleased with the ARPU. Now also understand that the vast majority came from domestic because we only launched in a couple of territories, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands and Canada with this, and so, these are mostly domestic subs. But, I think it's all very, very positive story in terms of the - the manner in which people bought this and as I said earlier, the ARPU. And the other thing that we noted that was that the bundle with ESPN and with Hulu was very helpful in terms of lowering churn rates. And as I said, in my remarks, both the conversion from free-to-pay, as well as the churn rates were much better than we expected they would be - much better than we had estimated they would be before we launched. And I think, again, that's the result of - that starts with the product and I think the end of - the user interface also got incredibly high marks in terms of the ease of use, the easy navigation, the quality of the product, the value of the brands and the price point which we can't ignore, a very accessible price point, priced purposely because of the brand and our desire to be as accessible as possible on a broad basis. Regarding the studio, look, a $11 billion plus Box Office year from the Disney studio alone is not something we're likely to repeat right away, but as we look ahead, we're extremely pleased with the long-term prospects for our studio and the slate. I could name a number of titles, but this year, for instance, we have to Pixar titles with Onward and Soul in the marketplace. We've got a couple of really strong Disney branded Jungle Cruise and Mulan. We have obviously Marvel with Black Widow, initial at first, and then Eternals at the rest of the - at the end of the year and you can imagine, a lot of development from all of those. On the Star Wars front, were it - as I had mentioned in previous calls, we're taking a bit of a hiatus in terms of theatrical release, we finished the nine-episode Skywalker Saga, and we're developing both television and features. The priority in the next few years is television with The Mandalorian Season 2 coming in October, and then more coming from The Mandalorian thereafter, including the possibility of infusing it with more characters and the possibility of taking those characters in their own direction in terms of series. And then, we have a prequel to Rogue One in an Obi Wan series, also in development. So the priority for Star Wars in the short-term is going to be, I'll call it television for Disney+, and then we will have more to say about development of theatrical soon after that. But 2020 is not going to be the same as 2019 for the studio. But as we still expect a very strong year, and given the franchises and the talent that we both work with, and have working for us, we are confident that the studio is going to continue to be a strong driver of operating income for the company, both on the movie front, but also as a great supplier of product both original and secondary market for Disney+ and for Hulu, by the way. I think, John, you touched - when you touched on it related to the U.S. I was actually going to bring up the 60 million to 90 million included obviously two-thirds of that subs that we were going to get from outside the United States, where except for just a few markets we've not even launched yet. So, it's far too early for us after, basically, a quarter and a little bit more under our belt to change our guidance, having not launched in any of the big international markets yet. What we know about those markets, not in any way pour cold water on them, because we know that those brands are strong in the markets, and this product is already working. The interest in streaming, in general, in those markets, isn't as high as it has been in the United States. I'm talking about across the world. So we have probably more of a marketing effort and I'd say, more of a challenge to launch in those markets, not that those markets haven't been already seeded with streaming, we know Netflix has done extremely well Internationally. But we're just beginning there, and I think it's just premature for us to take our guidance up. What we do know, of course, is that we have reached a number in the United States that since you did the math that would suggest that we're at the number that we predicted we would be in year five, just after a very short period of time, and I don't know whether that is a statement about the total available market or the quality of the product or both, or the price. It is just the way I think a number of factors that I've touched upon, and I just - I'll go over them one more time. Those brands are extreme - not only are they high quality, It is a very unique product. I was asked earlier on CNBC about whether I felt threatened by competition, there's obviously more competition coming into the space, But there isn't any competition that is like ours, like our product, because of the investments that we've made in those franchises and the quality of the product that we've made over the years and we're continuing to make. So we're very differentiated, we're extremely well priced. And we created a service tech - from a technical basis and the user interface basis, that is really working. There's an elegance to it and an ease, and we feel great about it. So our - as we look ahead at that guidance, and I can't say that we won't change in at some point, but it's - we don't believe that it would be prudent for us to adjust it at this point, and we have a long way to go. We measured - in terms of the - I'll call it engagement, we've measured recency, which is essentially how many people are - used it recently, are active users on a weekly basis, that's extremely high. We measure frequency, which is a number of times people stream per week since launch and we measure engagement, which is basically how many hours people have streamed on a weekly or basis per subscriber, and I don't think we should get into all those details right now, except to say that in all three cases, recency, the percentage of people that it - are weekly active users, very, very high. The same thing is true with frequency the number of average days that they actually use the service, and again this is something that we've seen over both - basically, the first quarter. I think these numbers probably relate to the first quarter and not necessarily since December 28, that's also very high and the engagement, or we were looking at multiple hours a week stream, per subscriber. I can give you that now, that's in the six hours to seven hours a week range, very, very high. Now Christmas was in there, time when a lot of families were off, that may have actually skewed that a little bit high, but again we're seeing consumption, I'll call it across the board, and in sum, it is quite interesting to us. Pixar has done extremely well, as a, for instance, including their shorts, musicals are doing very, very well. Obviously, great interest in some of the big titles that have recently come on the service. Toy Story 4 just came on. I think, Rise of Skywalker later in the year. Lion King came on, Avengers, I mentioned Endgame. It's kind of, I guess, and without, in anyway, sounding like we're bragging, it validates the concept of putting those brands together and collecting library. As we look to the rest of the world, there really isn't anything to cite in terms of encumbrances that would be an issue. We're in relatively good shape there. I'd say that we have some work to do in terms of local product, because there are quotas in certain markets that we have to meet. But the universal appeal of - of this product is - is pretty strong. You do have to factor in that, in some markets, there's lower broadband penetration. And so you don't have the total available - the total available market is not as high as it is in other markets. Netherlands was very high. That's why we decided the launch there. South Korea is very high. But there are other markets, obviously, India being one, that you have lower broadband. But huge opportunities - huge opportunities for us, Internationally, and that's where that Disney name and that family nature of the product, I think, will resonate extremely well. I think we go first because we want to do is Hulu SVOD ARPU? And regarding other growth possibilities for the parks, it's really going to be a blend. We continue to invest capital to build out new attractions, new hotels, new restaurants. We've announced many different projects. Obviously, we just opened Rise of the Resistance and that's done extremely well, not just in terms of attendance but per capita spending has been quite high. We have a variety of different Marvel projects underway. The Avengers project in California, and a number of Marvel related things in Florida, including a Guardians of the Galaxy E-ticket attraction. So, we're going to continue to build out against the Company's most popular, or using the most popular franchises. And as I mentioned, build out hotels as well. We just opened one Riviera Resort we're opening one in Florida. We have a Star Wars themed hotel coming, a lot of activity there. We will look for international opportunities as well. They still exist, and obviously, the virus has slowed things down a bit, but we expect that when that passes that we will start looking expansively in other territories. And of course, lastly there is a yield story to tell and that's been exceptional that is a combination of things. But clearly, far more sophisticated, more thoughtful pricing strategy has helped a lot. Taking advantage of peak periods and pricing leverage but also making the parks more accessible in non-peak periods for others at substantially more accessible prices. Yes Steve, we haven't had a conversation about price since we launched except that we felt that our pricing strategy has worked. We really are not focused right now on price at all. We believed all along that we would have an opportunity to address pricing as we added more content, really original content, and the price-value relationship went up to the consumer, but it's not a priority of ours right now. We're still as we're very new with this. So, I think it would be premature for us to start talking about, and don't expect anything in the near term, very near term from a price increase perspective. Christine, you want to take the question about the studio? The theatrical window is working for this company and we have no plans to adjust it for our business. Your comment about how those companies are faring on the market, I think, maybe is a reflection of how the other movie companies are positioning their films and their business we're not the only movie company. We are the biggest Box Office, but we're not the only movie company and I suspect that it's not due to us or either a lack of conviction on our part or any suspicion that we might not be - that we might not be telling the truth. But we're not - it's working for us, and we have no plans in the foreseeable future to change it that requires."

            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thanks Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.53. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start, as evidenced by our first quarter results, and as Bob discussed, we are incredibly pleased with the launch of Disney+ and the positive consumer response we have received to-date. In terms of our fiscal first quarter results, our Studios creative momentum continues to deliver outstanding financial performance. Operating income was up significantly compared to Q1 last year, driven by growth and worldwide theatrical and higher TVs SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio. The actual results reflect the performance of Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of SkyWalker in the quarter compared to theatrical releases last year, which included Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns and The Nutcracker. Higher legacy TV SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. The increases in our legacy theatrical and TV SVOD businesses were partially offset by a $50 million loss at the 21CF studio business, as operating income from TV SVOD distribution was more than offset by an operating loss at Worldwide Theatrical, and general and administrative costs. At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher results at Consumer Products and at our domestic Parks and Resorts, partially offset by lower results at our international Parks and Resorts. Consumer Products operating income was up 25% due to growth in merchandise licensing as a result of strong revenue growth from sales of Frozen and Star Wars merchandise, both of which benefited from theatrical releases in the quarter. Revenue at domestic Parks and Experiences was up an impressive 10% in the quarter, driven by higher guest spending and to a lesser extent increases in attendance at our domestic Parks and Resorts. Operating income at domestic Parks and Experiences was up 6% as the flow through from strong revenue growth was dampened by operational expenses associated with Galaxy's Edge and significant labor expense growth due to higher wages as a result of collective bargaining agreements. Attendance at our domestic Parks was up 2% in the first quarter and per capita guest spending was up 10% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 4%, and occupancy was 92%. So far this quarter domestic resort reservations are pacing up 4% compared to this time last year, and book rates at our domestic hotels are currently pacing up 10%. At our International Operations, operating income was lower in Q1 as improved results at Shanghai Disney Resort were more than offset by a decline of about $80 million at Hong Kong Disneyland due to lower attendance and hotel occupancy. Hong Kong Disneyland results in the quarter are consistent with the outlook we communicated last quarter. However, the recent closure of our parks in both Shanghai and Hong Kong, due to the ongoing Corona virus situation will negatively impact second quarter and full year results. The current closure is taking place during the quarter in which we typically see strong attendance and occupancy levels due to the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday. The precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures and how quickly we can resume normal operations. At Shanghai Disney Resort, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an adverse impact to second quarter operating income of approximately $135 million, assuming the park is closed for two months during Q2. At Hong Kong Disneyland, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an additional adverse impact to operating income of about $40 million for the second quarter. As I discussed last quarter, we were already seeing a significant decrease in visitation to Hong Kong Disneyland from China, and other parts of Asia. So in aggregate, we estimate these two factors could result in a decline in Hong Kong Disneyland's Operating income of about $145 million for the second quarter. Again, this assumes the resort is closed for two months. Turning to Media Networks, Operating income was up in the first quarter due to increases at both Cable and Broadcasting. Higher cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, partially offset by a decrease at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs, primarily driven by contractual rate increases at NFL, college football and the launch of the ACC Network in addition to lower ad revenue. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was down 4.5% in the first quarter due to lower average viewership primarily for NBA and college football regular-season games, which more than offset an increase in viewership from Monday night football. On note, that when you look at ad revenue across all ESPN domestic ad platforms, which include digital and addressable advertising revenue reported in our DTCI segment, ESPN's total domestic ad revenue in the first quarter was roughly comparable to the prior year. So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing up 2% compared to last year. At Broadcasting, higher results in the quarter were due to the consolidation of 21CF and a benefit from new accounting guidance which is explained further in our press release and 10-Q filings, partially offset by lower results from our legacy operations. Results at our legacy Broadcasting operations were lower in the quarter as higher affiliate revenue was more than offset by lower ad revenue, a difficult program sales comp at ABC Studios and higher network programming and production costs. Lower program sales at ABC Studios reflect the prior year sale of Marvel's The Punisher, during Q1 last year and no comparable sale in the first quarter this year. Total Broadcasting ad revenue was lower in the quarter, driven by lower political advertising at our owned stations and a decline at the ABC Network. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 19% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 14 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 2-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which was aided by about a 2.5 point benefit from the launch of the ACC Network. Operating losses at our Direct-to-Consumer and International segment increased in the quarter driven by cost incurred to support the successful launch of Disney+, the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu, and higher programing costs at ESPN Plus. These operating losses were partially offset by the consolidation of the 21CF international cable businesses. Results at our Direct-to-Consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of $845 million, which was in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $900 million in operating losses for the second quarter and we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, specifically Disney+, which will launch in a number of European markets late in the second quarter, and the consolidation of Hulu to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $520 million. As Bob mentioned, Disney+ had 28.6 million paid subscribers as of yesterday, an increase of 2.1 million since the end of the first quarter. In the near-term, we expect subscriber growth to come primarily from outside the U.S., with the next meaningful phase of domestic subscriber growth likely to coincide with the release later this calendar year of highly anticipated original content, including episodic series from Marvel and Season 2 of The Mandalorian. Turning to the elimination segment, revenue and profit eliminations were significantly higher in Q1, driven primarily by the inter-segment content sales from the Studio and Media Networks to DTCI. I'll note that our 10-Q this quarter contains additional detail on the general structure and accounting treatment of the various types of inter-segment content transactions reflected in our segment results. Lastly, we continue to make progress on realizing the value of the 21CF acquisition. The businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of inter-segment eliminations, contributed approximately $590 million in segment operating income in the first quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out inter-segment eliminations, resulted in a positive impact total segment operating income of about $300 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF, and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a total dilutive impact on our Q1 EPS before purchase accounting of $0.27 per share, and we estimate the acquisition of 21st Century Fox in the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu will have a dilutive impact on our Q2 earnings per share before purchase accounting of about $0.25 per share. We are still on track for the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to (multiple speakers) take your questions. Hulu SVOD ARPU is very strong. The ad-supported, the product is priced at $5.99 and - but the ad-supported part of the equation, it makes the ARPU come out even higher than the ad free. Most of the subscribers subscribe to the ad-supported. So that's a good balance of the ARPUs when you stack them up next to each other. Let me take the domestic park question on international visitation. We have typically run in the 18% to 22% range for guests outside of the U.S. We're at the low-end of that range, maybe a tick below right now because some of the South American markets, because of the disruption in those economies have had lower visitation. The two I would cite, would be - that won't be a surprise to anyone, would be Brazil and Argentina. In general, the parks do not have a significant amount of visitation from Asia. When you look at Walt Disney World, no Asian market even factors into the top five, and the top one being the UK, which I think everyone knows that. And then we have Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Argentina, that is for the East Coast, Walt Disney World. And then when you look at Disneyland, Canada is a very strong market for us, no surprise, just given proximity to the West Coast markets of Vancouver. And then, we also have Mexico, Australia, and the only market that even breaks into the top five would be Japan and it's actually a very low single-digit number for Disneyland. And so far, there has been no evidence that there is any impact on the intent to visit, or people fulfilling reservations or commitments from Coronavirus. Yes let me take that. As Bob already mentioned our studio, our legacy Disney studio had nothing short of a truly phenomenal year six movies, over $1 billion in the global box office. That is an incredibly hard - seven movies over sorry about that. seven movies over $1 billion, that's an incredibly hard comp on a year-over-year. So, we will still - we still believe that our studio will be very successful this year. And we have confidence in their content resonating with consumers on a global basis. Bob already mentioned some of the big movies that we have coming out, and we feel really good about those. As it relates to transfer pricing of content, the studio definitely will benefit from the content sales to DTCI. The Pay 1 windows and we had quite a few movies come out in fiscal 2019, that will make it into the Pay 1 window in fiscal 2020, and that will also have a positive impact on the studio."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Tammy Munsey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTammy Munsey: Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everyone to the Walt Disney Company's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www. disney. com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and we'll post a transcript of this call to our website. Joining me remotely today are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer, and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll of course, be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Tammy, and good afternoon, everyone. As we close out the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to say that it's been a very productive year for The Walt Disney Company. As we've made great strides in reopening our business, while also taking meaningful and innovative steps to position ourselves for continued long-term growth. Despite the many ongoing challenges of the pandemic, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.37 compared to a loss of $0.20 last year. Christine will go more in-depth on the quarter and the coming year in her remarks. Last quarter, we talked about our strategic priorities for the future. And as we head into fiscal '22, we remain keenly focused on advancing them to drive our continued growth. First and foremost, telling the world's most original enduring stories. Second, maximizing the synergy of our unique ecosystem to deepen consumers' connection to our characters and our stories. And lastly, using the power of our far reaching platforms and new technologies to give consumers the best entertainment experience possible.  I'll briefly talk about how we are executing against these priorities in 3 key areas: Direct-to-Consumer, sports, and Parks, Experiences, and Products. On the Direct-to-Consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the success of our portfolio streaming services. Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu continue to perform incredibly well with a 118.1 million, 17.1 million, and 43.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of a 179 million subscriptions. To put this growth in perspective, in the past fiscal year alone, we have grown the total number of subscriptions across our DTC portfolio by 48%, and Disney+ subs in particular by 60%. I want to reiterate that we remain focused on managing our DTC business for the long-term, not quarter-to-quarter. And we're confident we are on the right trajectory to achieve the guidance that we provided at last year's Investors Day, reaching between 230 million and 260 million paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal year 2024, and with Disney+ achieving profitability that same year.  This Friday, we will celebrate the 2-year anniversary of the launch of Disney+ with our first ever Disney+ Day of global, Company-wide celebration. We are enormously proud of all that we've accomplished with the service in just the first 2 years. It has exceeded our wildest expectations, and we are so excited for what's to come. With this in mind, we have numerous activations planned across the entire Company for Disney+ Day, including the streaming premiere of Marvel Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings, which has already surpassed $430 million at the global box office. Other content coming to the service on Disney+ Day includes the highly anticipated Disney+ original movie, Home Sweet Home Alone, the epic adventure, Jungle Cruise, and a hilarious new short from The Simpsons, and the first 5 episodes of season 2 of the fantastic National Geographic series, The World According to Jeff Goldblum.  And there's more great content in the pipeline. On the heels of Disney+ Day, we'll premiere 2 amazing new original series, Marvel's Hawkeye on November 24th, and the latest Star Wars adventure, The Book of Boba Fett on December 29th. And of course, we're extremely excited about the Thanksgiving holiday weekend debut of The Beatles: Get Back, Peter Jackson's highly anticipated 3-part documentary. Additionally, Marvel's Eternals, which has reached more than $161 million at the global box office in less than a week and Disney's Encanto, which premieres in theaters on November 24th, will come to the service after their exclusive theatrical runs. In total, we are nearly doubling the amount of original content from our marquee brands, Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and National Geographic coming to Disney+ in FY '22, with the majority of our highly anticipated titles arriving July through September.  This represents the beginning of the surge of new content shared last December at our investor conference 2.0. We recognize that the single most effective way to grow our streaming platforms worldwide is with great content. And we are singularly focused on making new, high-quality entertainment, including local and regional content that we believe will resonate with audiences. Of note, we have 340 plus local original titles in various stages of development and production for our DTC platforms over the next few years. As you know, we announced at our last Investor Day that we expect our total content expense to be between $8 and $9 billion in fiscal 2024, and we will now be increasing that investment further with the primary driver being more local and regional content. We are expanding our global reach by introducing Disney+ in additional markets around the world.  The service is now available throughout Japan and we're thrilled to be launching it this Friday on Disney+ Day in South Korea, in Taiwan, and in Hong Kong on November 16. In just 2 short years, we're now in over 60 countries and more than 20 languages. And next year, we plan to bring Disney+ to consumers in 50 plus additional countries, including in Central, Eastern Europe, The Middle East, and South Africa. Our goal is to more than double the number of countries we are currently in to over 160 by fiscal year '23. Turning to Sports, we continue to build out ESPN+ with exclusive sports content that makes our DTC offering the perfect complement to the ESPN linear experience. And with every new sports rights deal, we have considered both linear and DTC. In fact, all 7 of the major deals we made in the last year-and-a-half included a streaming component.  Among them is our historic 10-year NFL rights agreement, which begins in 2023. We also recently signed a 5-year deal with the league for Monday night Wild Card game, which runs through 2025. Another example is our 7-year rights deal with the NHL, 75 of the League's live national games are and will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ is the sole home for more than 1,000 out-of-market NHL games. By the way, this is another reason that Disney Bundle is proving highly appealing to consumers. Because live sports are key element, and a key differentiator of our Disney ecosystem. Some 90% of the most-watched telecast last year were sports, and they continue to perform extremely well. For example, the NHL's opening night games on ESPN last month marked the highest viewed season opening doubleheader on record, with an increase of 54% over the 2019/2020 season opening day letter.  And we are particularly pleased with the NHL 's Direct-to-Consumer performance on ESPN+ and Hulu. Likewise, the hugely popular UFC, fresh off a strong card at Madison Square Garden last weekend, continues to be a top performer for ESPN+ with 6 of the top UFC on ESPN+ pay-per-views coming in the past year. At the same time, we continue to expand our original sports programming with innovative broadcast like the hugely popular Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli, which airs on ESPN2, and reached 1.9 million viewers by its second week, as well as the highly anticipated new shows like Man in the Arena: Tom Brady, the multi-part docuseries about the legendary quarterback premiering on ESPN+ on November 16, along with a host of fantastic new social and digital shows and podcast.  We're also moving towards a greater presence in online sports betting. And given our reaching scale, we have the potential to partner with third-parties in this space in a very meaningful way. Suffice to say, we continue to see enormous opportunity in sports, and all of this, the right steels, our innovative programming, and the flexibility achieved through our DTC business, which saw ESPN+ subscribers, increased by 66% over the past fiscal year alone. All of this is a testament to the clear ambition we have in sports. One of the things that sets The Walt Disney Company apart is our unique access to an incredible number of consumer touch points across our businesses. That, of course, includes our parks and resorts, where we've achieved a number of important milestones since our last earnings call, including the first full quarter since the pandemic began with all of our Parks around the world open to guests, albeit with some limits on capacity, and the return of our entire Disney Cruise Line.  At the same time, the U.S. government's approval of vaccines for 5 to 11-year-olds, and the reopening of borders to fully vaccinated international travelers are both important steps towards the recovery of our business. But what is perhaps most exciting is the work that we have done during the time our Parks were closed to re-engineer and re-imagine the guest experience. We have introduced a number of exciting new offerings that enable guests to create their best Disney Day. In late August, Disneyland Resort launched Magic Key, the new annual membership program that is resonating strongly with Legacy Annual Passholders, while also attracting new passholders. In fact, about 40% of current sales are to new passholders. And most Magic Key holders have purchased the top 2 tiers, Dream Key and Believe Key. With Dream Key selling out in just 2 months.  We're also seeing a great response to the new Annual Passholder program at Walt Disney World. A testament to the demand for our in-park experiences and the success of our yield management strategy. Walt Disney World rolled out its new multi-tiered full service app, Disney Genie, which allows guests to easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer in order to have the best experience possible. The response to the service in just its first month has been extremely positive. The majority of Genie and Genie+ users have said it improved their overall park experience with nearly 1/3 of park guests upgrading to Genie+, making it possible for them to spend less time waiting in line and more time enjoying attractions, entertainment, dining, and retail opportunities. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing and look forward to launching Disney Genie at Disneyland very soon.  Alongside these transformative programs, we continue to invest in our parks and resorts themselves. We introduced a host of new attractions as part of Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary celebration, which kicked off on October 1st. These include Remy's Ratatouille Adventure at EPCOT, which has quickly become one of the parks top attractions, our new themed restaurant SPACE 220, and Two New Nighttime Spectaculars. And there is lots more in store in the coming month, including the highly anticipated indoor coaster Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, and the one-of-a-kind Galactic Starcruiser experience. As part of this immersive 2-night adventure, guests will become heroes of their own Star Wars stories. Reservations went on sale just 3 weeks ago, and the first 4 months of voyages have virtually sold out for this premium experience.  Disney Cruise Line continues to be one of the highest rated guest experiences of any of our offerings. As I said earlier, all 4 of our ships are now sailing and we continue to see tremendous demand for the incredible experiences we offer at sea. We are thrilled to be launching a new ship, the Disney Wish in June of 2022 and will welcome her sister ships to the fleet in 2024 and 2025. Combined, these 3 vessels will help increase capacity and our footprint in a business that has historically generated a double-digit return on investment, driven by a premium price might well above the industry average. Before leaving our Parks and Experiences, I want to mention the continued transformation of our Consumer Products business. We have almost completed the reduction of our physical footprint, which will enable us to pivot our approach with a focus on our e-commerce platform, shopDisney, and on more compelling retail partnerships, such as Disney Store at Target, which will triple its locations by the end of the year.  In short, our parks around the globe now have more to offer guests than ever before, with our new offerings and we're making it even easier for them to have the best time imaginable, tailored specifically to their individual needs and preferences in a way, only Disney can. Our Company is truly unique and that we have a significant presence in the physical world through our parks and resorts, as well as media entertainment assets in the digital world. And it is incredible to see how our use of our emerging technology and insights gained through our innumerable consumer touch points, is enabling us to transform the way people interact with and experience our stories and products in both worlds. The Walt Disney Company has a long track record as an early adopter in the use of technology to enhance the entertainment experience.  Steamboat Willie, the first cartoon with synchronize sound, our groundbreaking development and use of Audio-Animatronics, we were the first to distribute downloaded content on the new Apple iPod back in 2005, Pixar has been a pioneer in computer animation, these are just a few examples. Suffice it to say, our efforts to-date are merely a prologue to a time when we'll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling without boundaries in our own Disney metaverse. And we look forward to creating unparalleled opportunities for consumers to experience everything Disney has to offer across our products and platforms wherever the consumer may be. As we look ahead to this next frontier, given our unique combination of brands, franchises, physical and digital experiences, and global reach, we see limitless potential, and that makes as excited as ever about The Walt Disney Company's next 100 years. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine, and she'll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the year ahead.\nChristine Mccarthy: Thank you, Bob. And good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.37, an increase of $0.57 from the prior year quarter. For the full fiscal 2021 year, diluted EPS excluding certain items was $2.29, or an increase of $0.27 versus the prior year. As a reminder, these results take into account that fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year compared to our usual 52-week year in 2021. We estimate that the additional week in 2020 resulted in a benefit to pre -tax income of approximately $200 million, primarily at the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, creating an unfavorable comparison for fiscal year '21. I'll now turn to our results in the quarter by segment, beginning with Parks, Experiences, and Products where fourth quarter operating income increased by $1.6 billion year-over-year. A profitable fourth quarter at Parks and Experiences reflects our ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  All of our sites were open for the entire quarter, although generally at reduced capacities. In the prior-year quarter, Shanghai Disney Resort was open for the entire quarter, while Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris were open for approximately 12 weeks. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was open for approximately 4 weeks. And Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. Attendance trends continued to strengthen at our domestic parks, with Walt Disney World Q4 attendance up double-digits versus Q3, and Disneyland attendance continuing to strengthen significantly from its reopening in the third quarter. Guest spending at our domestic parks also continued its strong trend, with per cap in the fourth quarter up nearly 30% versus fiscal 2019.  Our forward-looking demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort remains strong, demonstrating our brand strength, as well as more normalized consumer behavior. Additionally, we're looking forward to the return of international attendance at our domestic parks and resorts. However, keep in mind that due to longer vacation planning lead times, we don't expect to see a substantial recovery in international attendance at our domestic parks until towards the end of fiscal 2022. At our cruise line business, as Bob mentioned earlier, our entire fleet has returned to sea with guest ratings as strong as pre -pandemic levels despite new health and safety protocols. While we expect social distancing restrictions on our ships to remain in place for at least the first half of fiscal 2022, booked occupancy on our ships for the second half of the year is already ahead of historical ranges at significantly higher pricing.  And we are excited for the Disney Wish to set sail in June 2022, with the inaugural season already nearly 90% booked. At consumer products, year-over-year operating results declined in the fourth quarter, impacted by a tough comparison in our games business due to the prior year performance of 2 titles, Marvel's Avengers and Twisted Wonderland. Turning to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, fourth quarter operating income decreased by approximately $600 million versus the prior year driven by lower results at Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and content sales, licensing, and other. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decline in Q4 operating income versus prior year. Operating results at Linear Networks did decrease year-over-year by approximately $200 million driven by a decrease at our domestic channels, partially offset by an improvement at our international channels. At our domestic channels, both broadcasting and cable operating income decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year.  Lower results of broadcasting were driven by lower results at ABC and the owned television stations. At ABC, the decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing and programming and production costs, reflecting a higher number of series versus the prior year due to last year's production delays as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter, partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. The decrease at the owned television stations was due to lower advertising revenue, reflecting comparisons to the 53rd week and stronger political advertising in the prior year. At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income was primarily driven by 3 factors. 1. Lower affiliate revenue, primarily driven by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. 2. An increase in marketing cost for more titles premiering in the current quarter, which we also discussed last quarter.  And finally, to a lesser extent, lower advertising revenue. These impacts were partially offset by lower programming and production costs, which generally reflect COVID-19 related timing impacts from the prior year. Cost decreased for the NBA and MLB programming versus the prior year, partially offset by increased cost for college football games. Domestic Linear Networks advertising revenue decreased in Q4 versus the prior year, driven by our Cable networks and owned television stations. Both of which were impacted by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. ESPN advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was comparable to the prior year, as higher rates were offset by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. First quarter to date, domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above the prior year, benefiting from increased ratings for college football and the NFL. Total domestic affiliate revenue decreased by 6% in the quarter.  This was driven by a benefit of 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 7 point decline due to the 53rd week adjustment and a 3 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. International channel results increased versus the prior year driven by lower programming and production costs and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. At Direct-to-Consumer, our fourth quarter operating results decreased by $256 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+, partially offset by improved results at Hulu. At Disney+, the higher loss versus the prior-year quarter was driven by higher programming, marketing, and technology costs. These higher costs were partially offset by increases in Subscription and Premier Access revenue.  Higher Subscription revenue reflects subscriber growth, and increases in retail pricing. And the increases in costs reflect the ongoing expansion of Disney+. Higher Premier Access revenue was driven by Black Widow and Jungle Cruise in Q4 compared to Mulan in the prior-year quarter. As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the fourth quarter and the fiscal year with over 118 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 2 million net additions from Q3 in line with the subscriber guidance we gave in September. Subscribers across our domestic and core international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar grew by almost 4 million from Q3 to Q4. Disney+ Hotstar subs decreased versus the prior quarter and accounted for about 37% of our total Disney+ paid subscriber base as of the end of the fourth quarter. Disney+ 's global ARPU in the fourth quarter was $4.12.  Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.24 or an increase of about $0.12 versus the third quarter continuing to benefit from recent price increases. At ESPN+ where we ended the fourth quarter with over 17 million subscribers versus nearly 15 million in Q3, the decrease in operating results year-over-year was driven by higher marketing and sports programming costs, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, higher operating results in the fourth quarter versus the prior year were due to subscription revenue growth, and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by increases in programming, and to a lesser extent, marketing costs. Hulu ended the fourth quarter with 43.8 million paid subscribers, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service.  Hulu Live subscribers increased to 4 million from 3.7 million at the end of the third quarter. Moving on to Content Sales, Licensing, and Other, results decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $65 million, driven by lower theatrical and TV/SVOD distribution results, both of which we noted as drivers in the guidance we gave during the last earnings call. While theaters have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged and gradual pace of recovery in this business. Lower theatrical results were driven by higher operating losses from more titles and release, as well as higher marketing expenses for future releases. Lower TV/SVOD results were due to lower third-party content licensing of film content, driven by the ongoing impact of COVID, as well as our strategic shift towards distribution on our DTC services, partially offset by higher income from sales of episodic content due to lower write-offs versus the prior year.  To conclude, as we progress into fiscal 2022 and beyond, there are a number of items I would like to mention. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 were $3.6 billion or approximately $400 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion. CapEx for the year came in lower than the previous guidance we gave primarily due to spending delays across the enterprise. For fiscal 2022, we expect CapEx to increase by $2.5 billion versus 2021, driven by the delivery of the Disney Wish, as well as other increased spending at DPEP incorporate. At DPEP, we expect that per cap spending at our domestic Parks in fiscal 2022 will continue to significantly exceed pre -pandemic levels, and we are particularly encouraged by the early response we are seeing to Genie at Walt Disney World. However, we also expect that while we continue to pursue strong cost mitigation efforts, certain costs will be elevated in fiscal '22 versus pre -pandemic levels, including for example, inflationary pressure on wages, costs related to new projects and initiatives such as Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, Avengers Campus, and the EPCOT expansion and a ramp up of expenses in support of our cruise ship expansion.  And as we think about fiscal '22 results at DMED, there are few things worth noting. First, we are excited about the 9 theatrical releases we have slated for the first quarter of fiscal '22. However, we expect that the prolonged recovery we're seeing in the theatrical market, paired with the marketing costs associated with each release may adversely impact theatrical operating results in the first quarter by approximately $300 million versus the prior-year quarter, which had only 2 releases. At Linear Networks, we expect that first quarter operating income will decrease by nearly $500 million versus the prior year. Reflecting factors including higher contractual sports rights costs for college football and the NFL. Timing of cricket expenses at Star India  an adverse comparison to the prior year's political advertising revenue.  Finally as it relates to our expectations for Disney+. Looking at fiscal '22, we are thrilled about the quality of the content coming in the first 3 quarters of the year. But we will not yet be at our anticipated steady-state cadence of content releases. The fourth quarter will likely be more indicative of what our slate could look like once we have  content flowing steadily from all of our industry-leading creative engines. Q4 will be the first time in Disney+ history that we plan to release original content throughout the quarter from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and Nat Geo all in one quarter. This include highly anticipated titles such as Ms. Marvel, Andor, and Pinocchio. And as Bob mentioned earlier, we are also increasing our local content offerings in Asia, India, Europe, and Latin America in fiscal 2022, with the majority of those titles also releasing in the back part of the year.  As we've discussed before, we don't anticipate that sub-growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter. So putting this all together and also taking into consideration the timing of our planned international launches in 2022, we expect Disney+ subscriber net adds in the second half of fiscal 2022 will be meaningfully higher than the first half of the year. Additionally, we now expect the Disney+ will reach its peak year of losses in fiscal 2022 instead of in fiscal 2021, as better-than-expected revenue and lower content expenses due to production delays contributed to lower-than-expected losses in 2021. As Bob mentioned, we are increasing our overall long-term content expense for Disney+. And we believe we are well-positioned to achieve the subscriber target of 230 million to 260 million by fiscal 2024 that we laid out at last year's Investor Day. And we also remain confident in our expectations that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tammy, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nTammy Munsey: Thanks, Christine. As we transition to the Q&A, let me know that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&A by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that Jonathan, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. Bob or -- and/or Christine. I think there's 2 areas where expectations have probably been out of line with reality this year, that's a  on the stock. One of them is the Disney+ net adds, the other is probably more recently on Parks margins and you talked a lot about both of those in your prepared remarks. But maybe you could just spend a minute, on both topics. On Disney+, it sounds like we should think about net-adds being higher in 23 and 24 than in 22 based on the surge that I think you mentioned, Bob, on the programming side. So I'm wondering if you could help us with that. I think that would help set the expectations in the right spot. And then on the Parks front. Bob, you talked a lot about Parks margins, when you get back to prior peak revenues being at or maybe even higher than before, but obviously there is also not a linear ramp on the margin front either. So if you could talk a little bit about how expenses come back into the business over the course of time as it recovers relative to revenue, so we make sure we're thinking about that business the right way in this set of unusual circumstance coming out of a pandemic. Thank you.\nTammy Munsey: Bob, why don't you start off with Disney+ net ads, and Parks as well. And then Christine, maybe you can chime in on the expenses for Parks?\nBob Chapek: Okay. Thank you, Ben. On the Disney+ side, as Christine had said, we're real pleased with where we're sitting. But again, it's not going to be a linear rate quarter to quarter. I think the recovery that you mentioned in terms of getting the growth rate back up to where it's been historically, is really going to come in the third and the fourth quarters. The third quarter will be powered, not necessarily by the content, but by the number of ads that we have in terms of markets. Our number of markets that we're going to add will essentially double to more than 160 by FY2023, and that will propel us in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter will be more of a function of that. Finally, the dam will break in terms of the content that we announced last December that will be substantial, and will lead to a cadence of content throughout the quarter that will look more like what we expect to see from an ongoing standpoint.  Obviously, we're only in year 2 of the Disney+ launch, and the hunger for content, for the service is extraordinary. And when you have that happen at the same time that you have a pandemic, and you have to shut down production. That's not a good combination. And yet we identified the need for the content way-back exactly a year ago, and have prepared a very strong cadence of content which will now hit the pipeline in the second half of this year. In terms of the park situation, we are very bullish. We're seeing incredible 30% increases in per caps, as I think was referenced in the earnings letter. And so we're not only seeing strong demand, but it's at per caps that are much higher than we've traditionally seen.  There was a reference and I am not sure if everyone appreciates the gravity of this to the Genie+ success, 1/3 of our guests at Walt Disney World, are buying the Genie+ upgrade at $15, that's per guest, per day. And that is a very, very material increase for in per-caps, but also in margins. So we're very bullish about both our Disney+ business, both in terms of  of guidance that has been given today. But additionally, in terms of where our Parks business is going to go from a demand standpoint once we completely clear the pandemic, but also in terms of the what we expect to be a long lasting benefits in terms of yields. Christine?\nChristine Mccarthy: Thanks, Bob. And thanks, Ben. I'm glad you asked the question on Parks expenses. And I know you know this business well, but just for the benefit of some others that maybe newer to following Disney. Let's remember that the Parks expenses are in 3 buckets, fixed, which is quite substantial, semi-fixed, and variable. So variable was where we were really able to make some adjustments during COVID. But the other fixed and semi-fixed buckets are ones that we have to carry on regardless of the operating environment that we found ourselves in. So as we come back online, we've also done a lot of work on fundamentally changing some of the ways we've have done business on both the revenue side and the cost side to optimize margins. What you see this fourth quarter is an overall margin for the global business, for DPEP, a little under 12%, and that's well below our pre - COVID levels.  I've said this before and I'll say it again, that I believe that we will get not only back too, but have high probability of exceeding those previous margin levels in our parks because of some of the things we've done. We're using date-based pricing. We're strategically managing attendance. We do have some promotional offers that are really meant to balance yield with the demand, given capacity on any given day or week during the year. And on the cost efficiency side, we really made some improvements, not only to the cost side, but also that improves the guest experience. So those are things like the mobile food ordering that we have, a lot of people who have been to our parks since we reopened really enjoyed that. There's contactless check-ins at our hotels; lots of people enjoy that as well. We have virtual queues for selected attractions, and we're once again really looking at even physical park improvements that allow for better guests movement throughout the Parks.  So while these margins will remain impacted, while we are still operating under capacity constraints, again, we believe over the long term that these fundamental changes are going to yield -- are going to result in higher margins overall. So thanks for asking that question. And the other thing I would say is, Bob mentioned, Genie. Genie we have launched in Walt Disney World. We have not yet launched it in Disneyland. And I think when we have that exposure to the Disneyland, people who come to visit Disneyland -- the response will be as strong if not stronger. Thanks.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you both.\nTammy Munsey: Thank you, Ben. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Just a few questions if I may. First, ARPU on Hotstar is obviously lower than core Disney+ jobs. I'm curious if you could elaborate on the opportunity to narrow that gap over time and does it eventually become profitable contributor and maybe how much investment is needed in a big picture in that property? And then just my follow-up question is on the -- your decision to revert back to include the Asheboro releases, at least for now, it looks like even though they might be lost incurring initially, why do you ultimately feel that's a better model? Was it piracy, any color there? Thank you.\nTammy Munsey: Bob why don't you start with exclusive theatrical releases and then Christine can talk about Hotstar ARPU?\nBob Chapek: Okay. As you know, we have preached flexibility in terms of making decisions on distribution as we recover from the pandemic and in the mix of changing consumer behaviors. The extent to which we had a number of titles release going to theatrical will eventually go to Disney+, but what we're seeing is some recovery of the theatrical exhibition marketplace, which is a good thing by the way, for not only Disney but also for the industry, and because most of the franchises that we've had as Walt Disney Company have been built through the theatrical exhibition channel of distribution. At the same time, we're watching very, very carefully different types of movies to see how the different components of the demographics of that market come back. And we're watching very carefully our family films, as they are released over the next couple of months to make sure that that market will come back to theatrical exhibition as the general entertainment with say the films that appeal to a younger target audience have come back.  And so we're sticking with our plan of flexibility, because we're still unsure in terms of how the marketplace is going to react when family films come back with a theatrical first window. I should say that -- you'll notice that the films that we are putting into the marketplace, in theatrical that are family films have a fairly short window, at least in terms of any reference point to what history might have been. And we're doing that so that we can get our films quicker to Disney+ and -- but at the same time see if the theatrical market can kick back into full gear as we prime the pump with these films. But we're going to do what's best for our shareholders ultimately. And we don't announce our films that far in advance, like we used to because we know that we're in a time of flux and change still. And while COVID will be in the rearview mirror, God-willing, I think changing consumer behavior is something that's going to be more permanent. And so we're reading that on a weekly basis and make our decisions going forward accordingly.\nChristine Mccarthy: Thanks, Alexia, for your question on Hotstar ARPU. Just to make something very clear, the Disney+ Hotstar is included in our overall Disney+ guidance that we reiterate to be profitable in 2024. So I just want to make sure that everyone understands that. But as it relates to ARPU specifically, there's been a lot of noise in the Indian market, a lot of which has been around sport. So when you look at the ARPU for Hotstar on a linked quarter basis from Q3 to Q4 this year, it actually decreased, and that was a result of lower per sub advertising revenue because there were fewer IPL matches this year. In Q4, there were only 18, and I believe the number was 29-ish in Q3. So you had a linked-quarter reduction in games, therefore lower subscriber advertising revenue. And when we think about ARPU overall, there's several levers here. There is a price value relationship over time, high-quality content. And the content in India is really 2 things. It's not only the IPL, but other key sports like Beyond Cricket.  So you have things like the English Premier League and . And also there's a big general entertainment component. We have all of our Disney+ content over there for all the different labels that we have, Disney Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and so on. But they also have over 18,000 hours of original local programming that is produced every year. So once again, I think the upside potential as when all things are working, also cylinders are working and we'll be able to take price up as the market allows.\nTammy Munsey: Thank you. Thank you, Alexia. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your question, please.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Hey, Tammy. I have 2. One is I appreciate your view that the content side would get better, and it will drive some growth. But I really want to focus on the U.S. What gives you confidence that that's what is the reason for the slowing growth. Are there any cohorts, any demographics that you're underpenetrated. And perhaps the widening out of content is an issue versus just more new content. That's 1. And then 2 is we have covered Disney a long time, but I've never seen this much inflation before, and I don't think any of us have in 30 years. I wonder how will you mitigate that inflation, and at what point it would start becoming a meaningful drag on the margin recovery that you identified. Thanks.\nTammy Munsey: Thank you, Michael. Bob, how about if you talk about the Disney+ sub grows in the U.S. and Christine can talk about inflation?\nBob Chapek: So Michael, your first question was about the  of the supply chain  of new content coming into the service and its impact on our net sub adds. As you can probably suspect, in a world of to Direct-to-Consumer, we have a lot of information, a lot of data, and we have a pretty good idea of what the marginal impact of a particular title might be to our service, and we always say that library titles tend to increase engagement and minimize churn. But new titles, new content, whether the movies or series, add -- actually add new subs. And that is actually the reason why we're pretty confident that the increase in content flow towards the second half of fiscal '22 will actually lead to the types of results that we're anticipating. And so we've got some pretty good data that suggests that that is the case, given our history. While we only have two years, that two years has represented a number of titles, and you can start to build models as I'm sure you can understand.  Every time that we have a title, we have a pretty good idea of what the net impact that that's going to be, both from a retention and to an addition standpoint. So we're pretty confident that once we get to more of a normal content flow in the second half of the year that some of the vacuum that we've had over the last couple of months will not be the case. Christine, you want to handle the -- oh, and Charlie there was also a question about Cohorts widening. I'll handle that one as well. It is true that Disney+ is a 4 quadrant service. And as such, we need content that's going to be broad in order to appeal to each of those demographics. If there is an opportunity that we're working on right now, it's our preschool area. We believe that there's an opportunity for us to sort of assert ourselves in the Direct-to-Consumer way the same way we did in the Linear Networks with Disney Channel.  So that would be the biggest opportunity. And I can tell you that in sitting through our creator of reviews, the new content that we've got, the new storytelling that we've got in the area of preschool is absolutely extraordinary. And I think we're going to see a resurgence of Disney in that area in terms of content that's really going to become of the cultural zeitgeist, and then drive our subs amongst that particular cohort of potential sub-adds for Disney+. But it is true that being a 4-quadrant service, we need to be broad in our approach. And that's why we fired up the engines, the production engines of our Fox teams that we gotten in acquisitions  Searchlight, and just our general -- Disney General Entertainment team making content both for Hulu and for Disney+, as well as our services internationally. Christine?\nChristine Mccarthy: Thanks, Bob. Hi, Michael. I think you asked a question that's on the minds of every CFO and every senior management team of companies out there. Inflationary pressures are something we are all looking at and trying to assess, and think about how do we manage through it. This is also one that -- I just mentioned, we've already experienced in some parts of our business. So over the past year or so, we've talked about the increase in the price of content. You see the content, that because of just the competition for talent for everything that's involved in productions, content costs have gone up. Where we see it directly in our parks business is primarily through the hourly wage inflation that we've seen through contact -- contract renegotiation in our commitment to paying our park workers well.  And then we have things on the cost of goods side and it's interesting -- just last week maybe it was -- just last week I was talking to our Parks Senior Team about things we could do there, and there are lots of things that are worth talking about. We can adjust suppliers, we can substitute products, we can cut portion size which is probably good for some people's waistlines. We can look at pricing where necessary, but we aren't going to go just straight up across an increased prices. We're really going to try to get the algorithm right to cut where we can and not necessarily do things the same way.  As I mentioned, we're also using technology to reduce some of our operating costs, and that gives us a little bit of headroom also to absorb some inflation. But we're really trying to use our heads here to come up with a way to kind of mitigate some of these challenges that we have. It's a great question, and I'm sure it's one that you could ask every single Company in your coverage universe. Thanks.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks.\nTammy Munsey: Thank you Michael. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question for today then comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. 2 of course. First, could you talk about the advertising outlook? There's a lot of moving pieces here between strong upfront, good sports ratings, but supply chain issues affecting some categories. And within advertising, if you could talk a little bit more about Hulu advertising, what's going on there with your aired light service versus pure premium subscription. And then the second question is -- I know Bob mentioned in prepared remarks -- sports betting. Can you frame or give us any color on the opportunity? Obviously, it's an area of growth as more states are approving it and it effects advertising, which should be good for the stations. But how can you participate in a bigger way while still protecting the ESPN brand?\nTammy Munsey: Thank you, Jessica. Bob, why don't you address sports betting and Christine can talk about advertising.\nBob Chapek: Okay. Will do. Jessica, you're right. We do believe that sports betting is a very significant opportunity for the Company, and it's all driven by the consumer. It's driven by the consumer, particularly the younger consumer that will replenish the sports fans over time and their desire to have gambling as part of their sports experience. It's not necessarily a lean-back, it's a little bit of a lean-forward type experience that they're looking for. And as we follow the consumer, we necessarily have to seriously consider getting into gambling in a bigger way. And ESPN is a perfect platform for this. We have done substantial research in terms of the impact to not only to ESPN brand, but the Disney brand in terms of consumers changing perceptions of the acceptability of gambling.  And what we're finding is that there's a very significant isolation. Gambling does not have the cache now that it had, say 10 or 20 years ago. And we have some concerns as a Company about our ability to get in it without having a brand withdrawal. But I can tell you that given all the research that we've done recently, that that is not the case. It actually strengthens the brand of ESPN when you have a betting component, and it has no impact on the Disney brand. Therefore, to go after that demographic opportunity plus the, of course, not insignificant revenue implications, that is something that we're keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively.\nChristine Mccarthy: Okay. I'll take the advertising question, Jessica. So overall, the ad market is strong across our entire DMED portfolio. And the sports market is strong, and it's really being driven by football at both the college and professional level, NHL and the NBA. We are seeing some impact from supply chain issues impacting certain sales categories than the 2 that I would just call out are autos in technology and those are for obvious reasons that we all know about, the chip shortage. On Hulu specifically, we're really pleased with the advertising demand we've seen for Hulu. And we believe the overall addressable market in the U.S. market will continue to grow. Hulu, we believe also has some real strategic advantages in this space.  We've got a great slate of premium content and we've developed the ability to use our data to offer that targeting advertising, that advertisers really desire. And we also have a purpose built and unified ad platform. I mentioned this last quarter, but that's really helped us grow in addressable advertising. So we'll continue to make investments in technologies that are going to allow us to continue to exploit this advertising that we see on Hulu. And it's automating the sales process with programmatic, and advertisers self-service channels that we think are really going to continue to show good growth. So we expect advertising to continue to be an important driver of Hulu revenues going forward. Thanks.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nTammy Munsey: Jessica, thanks for the question.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christine Mccarthy",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. And good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.37, an increase of $0.57 from the prior year quarter. For the full fiscal 2021 year, diluted EPS excluding certain items was $2.29, or an increase of $0.27 versus the prior year. As a reminder, these results take into account that fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year compared to our usual 52-week year in 2021. We estimate that the additional week in 2020 resulted in a benefit to pre -tax income of approximately $200 million, primarily at the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, creating an unfavorable comparison for fiscal year '21. I'll now turn to our results in the quarter by segment, beginning with Parks, Experiences, and Products where fourth quarter operating income increased by $1.6 billion year-over-year. A profitable fourth quarter at Parks and Experiences reflects our ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  All of our sites were open for the entire quarter, although generally at reduced capacities. In the prior-year quarter, Shanghai Disney Resort was open for the entire quarter, while Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris were open for approximately 12 weeks. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was open for approximately 4 weeks. And Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. Attendance trends continued to strengthen at our domestic parks, with Walt Disney World Q4 attendance up double-digits versus Q3, and Disneyland attendance continuing to strengthen significantly from its reopening in the third quarter. Guest spending at our domestic parks also continued its strong trend, with per cap in the fourth quarter up nearly 30% versus fiscal 2019.  Our forward-looking demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort remains strong, demonstrating our brand strength, as well as more normalized consumer behavior. Additionally, we're looking forward to the return of international attendance at our domestic parks and resorts. However, keep in mind that due to longer vacation planning lead times, we don't expect to see a substantial recovery in international attendance at our domestic parks until towards the end of fiscal 2022. At our cruise line business, as Bob mentioned earlier, our entire fleet has returned to sea with guest ratings as strong as pre -pandemic levels despite new health and safety protocols. While we expect social distancing restrictions on our ships to remain in place for at least the first half of fiscal 2022, booked occupancy on our ships for the second half of the year is already ahead of historical ranges at significantly higher pricing.  And we are excited for the Disney Wish to set sail in June 2022, with the inaugural season already nearly 90% booked. At consumer products, year-over-year operating results declined in the fourth quarter, impacted by a tough comparison in our games business due to the prior year performance of 2 titles, Marvel's Avengers and Twisted Wonderland. Turning to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, fourth quarter operating income decreased by approximately $600 million versus the prior year driven by lower results at Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and content sales, licensing, and other. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decline in Q4 operating income versus prior year. Operating results at Linear Networks did decrease year-over-year by approximately $200 million driven by a decrease at our domestic channels, partially offset by an improvement at our international channels. At our domestic channels, both broadcasting and cable operating income decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year.  Lower results of broadcasting were driven by lower results at ABC and the owned television stations. At ABC, the decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing and programming and production costs, reflecting a higher number of series versus the prior year due to last year's production delays as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter, partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. The decrease at the owned television stations was due to lower advertising revenue, reflecting comparisons to the 53rd week and stronger political advertising in the prior year. At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income was primarily driven by 3 factors. 1. Lower affiliate revenue, primarily driven by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. 2. An increase in marketing cost for more titles premiering in the current quarter, which we also discussed last quarter.  And finally, to a lesser extent, lower advertising revenue. These impacts were partially offset by lower programming and production costs, which generally reflect COVID-19 related timing impacts from the prior year. Cost decreased for the NBA and MLB programming versus the prior year, partially offset by increased cost for college football games. Domestic Linear Networks advertising revenue decreased in Q4 versus the prior year, driven by our Cable networks and owned television stations. Both of which were impacted by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. ESPN advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was comparable to the prior year, as higher rates were offset by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. First quarter to date, domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above the prior year, benefiting from increased ratings for college football and the NFL. Total domestic affiliate revenue decreased by 6% in the quarter.  This was driven by a benefit of 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 7 point decline due to the 53rd week adjustment and a 3 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. International channel results increased versus the prior year driven by lower programming and production costs and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. At Direct-to-Consumer, our fourth quarter operating results decreased by $256 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+, partially offset by improved results at Hulu. At Disney+, the higher loss versus the prior-year quarter was driven by higher programming, marketing, and technology costs. These higher costs were partially offset by increases in Subscription and Premier Access revenue.  Higher Subscription revenue reflects subscriber growth, and increases in retail pricing. And the increases in costs reflect the ongoing expansion of Disney+. Higher Premier Access revenue was driven by Black Widow and Jungle Cruise in Q4 compared to Mulan in the prior-year quarter. As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the fourth quarter and the fiscal year with over 118 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 2 million net additions from Q3 in line with the subscriber guidance we gave in September. Subscribers across our domestic and core international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar grew by almost 4 million from Q3 to Q4. Disney+ Hotstar subs decreased versus the prior quarter and accounted for about 37% of our total Disney+ paid subscriber base as of the end of the fourth quarter. Disney+ 's global ARPU in the fourth quarter was $4.12.  Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.24 or an increase of about $0.12 versus the third quarter continuing to benefit from recent price increases. At ESPN+ where we ended the fourth quarter with over 17 million subscribers versus nearly 15 million in Q3, the decrease in operating results year-over-year was driven by higher marketing and sports programming costs, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, higher operating results in the fourth quarter versus the prior year were due to subscription revenue growth, and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by increases in programming, and to a lesser extent, marketing costs. Hulu ended the fourth quarter with 43.8 million paid subscribers, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service.  Hulu Live subscribers increased to 4 million from 3.7 million at the end of the third quarter. Moving on to Content Sales, Licensing, and Other, results decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $65 million, driven by lower theatrical and TV/SVOD distribution results, both of which we noted as drivers in the guidance we gave during the last earnings call. While theaters have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged and gradual pace of recovery in this business. Lower theatrical results were driven by higher operating losses from more titles and release, as well as higher marketing expenses for future releases. Lower TV/SVOD results were due to lower third-party content licensing of film content, driven by the ongoing impact of COVID, as well as our strategic shift towards distribution on our DTC services, partially offset by higher income from sales of episodic content due to lower write-offs versus the prior year.  To conclude, as we progress into fiscal 2022 and beyond, there are a number of items I would like to mention. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 were $3.6 billion or approximately $400 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion. CapEx for the year came in lower than the previous guidance we gave primarily due to spending delays across the enterprise. For fiscal 2022, we expect CapEx to increase by $2.5 billion versus 2021, driven by the delivery of the Disney Wish, as well as other increased spending at DPEP incorporate. At DPEP, we expect that per cap spending at our domestic Parks in fiscal 2022 will continue to significantly exceed pre -pandemic levels, and we are particularly encouraged by the early response we are seeing to Genie at Walt Disney World. However, we also expect that while we continue to pursue strong cost mitigation efforts, certain costs will be elevated in fiscal '22 versus pre -pandemic levels, including for example, inflationary pressure on wages, costs related to new projects and initiatives such as Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, Avengers Campus, and the EPCOT expansion and a ramp up of expenses in support of our cruise ship expansion.  And as we think about fiscal '22 results at DMED, there are few things worth noting. First, we are excited about the 9 theatrical releases we have slated for the first quarter of fiscal '22. However, we expect that the prolonged recovery we're seeing in the theatrical market, paired with the marketing costs associated with each release may adversely impact theatrical operating results in the first quarter by approximately $300 million versus the prior-year quarter, which had only 2 releases. At Linear Networks, we expect that first quarter operating income will decrease by nearly $500 million versus the prior year. Reflecting factors including higher contractual sports rights costs for college football and the NFL. Timing of cricket expenses at Star India  an adverse comparison to the prior year's political advertising revenue.  Finally as it relates to our expectations for Disney+. Looking at fiscal '22, we are thrilled about the quality of the content coming in the first 3 quarters of the year. But we will not yet be at our anticipated steady-state cadence of content releases. The fourth quarter will likely be more indicative of what our slate could look like once we have  content flowing steadily from all of our industry-leading creative engines. Q4 will be the first time in Disney+ history that we plan to release original content throughout the quarter from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and Nat Geo all in one quarter. This include highly anticipated titles such as Ms. Marvel, Andor, and Pinocchio. And as Bob mentioned earlier, we are also increasing our local content offerings in Asia, India, Europe, and Latin America in fiscal 2022, with the majority of those titles also releasing in the back part of the year.  As we've discussed before, we don't anticipate that sub-growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter. So putting this all together and also taking into consideration the timing of our planned international launches in 2022, we expect Disney+ subscriber net adds in the second half of fiscal 2022 will be meaningfully higher than the first half of the year. Additionally, we now expect the Disney+ will reach its peak year of losses in fiscal 2022 instead of in fiscal 2021, as better-than-expected revenue and lower content expenses due to production delays contributed to lower-than-expected losses in 2021. As Bob mentioned, we are increasing our overall long-term content expense for Disney+. And we believe we are well-positioned to achieve the subscriber target of 230 million to 260 million by fiscal 2024 that we laid out at last year's Investor Day. And we also remain confident in our expectations that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tammy, and we would be happy to take your questions. Thanks, Bob. And thanks, Ben. I'm glad you asked the question on Parks expenses. And I know you know this business well, but just for the benefit of some others that maybe newer to following Disney. Let's remember that the Parks expenses are in 3 buckets, fixed, which is quite substantial, semi-fixed, and variable. So variable was where we were really able to make some adjustments during COVID. But the other fixed and semi-fixed buckets are ones that we have to carry on regardless of the operating environment that we found ourselves in. So as we come back online, we've also done a lot of work on fundamentally changing some of the ways we've have done business on both the revenue side and the cost side to optimize margins. What you see this fourth quarter is an overall margin for the global business, for DPEP, a little under 12%, and that's well below our pre - COVID levels.  I've said this before and I'll say it again, that I believe that we will get not only back too, but have high probability of exceeding those previous margin levels in our parks because of some of the things we've done. We're using date-based pricing. We're strategically managing attendance. We do have some promotional offers that are really meant to balance yield with the demand, given capacity on any given day or week during the year. And on the cost efficiency side, we really made some improvements, not only to the cost side, but also that improves the guest experience. So those are things like the mobile food ordering that we have, a lot of people who have been to our parks since we reopened really enjoyed that. There's contactless check-ins at our hotels; lots of people enjoy that as well. We have virtual queues for selected attractions, and we're once again really looking at even physical park improvements that allow for better guests movement throughout the Parks.  So while these margins will remain impacted, while we are still operating under capacity constraints, again, we believe over the long term that these fundamental changes are going to yield -- are going to result in higher margins overall. So thanks for asking that question. And the other thing I would say is, Bob mentioned, Genie. Genie we have launched in Walt Disney World. We have not yet launched it in Disneyland. And I think when we have that exposure to the Disneyland, people who come to visit Disneyland -- the response will be as strong if not stronger. Thanks. Thanks, Alexia, for your question on Hotstar ARPU. Just to make something very clear, the Disney+ Hotstar is included in our overall Disney+ guidance that we reiterate to be profitable in 2024. So I just want to make sure that everyone understands that. But as it relates to ARPU specifically, there's been a lot of noise in the Indian market, a lot of which has been around sport. So when you look at the ARPU for Hotstar on a linked quarter basis from Q3 to Q4 this year, it actually decreased, and that was a result of lower per sub advertising revenue because there were fewer IPL matches this year. In Q4, there were only 18, and I believe the number was 29-ish in Q3. So you had a linked-quarter reduction in games, therefore lower subscriber advertising revenue. And when we think about ARPU overall, there's several levers here. There is a price value relationship over time, high-quality content. And the content in India is really 2 things. It's not only the IPL, but other key sports like Beyond Cricket.  So you have things like the English Premier League and . And also there's a big general entertainment component. We have all of our Disney+ content over there for all the different labels that we have, Disney Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and so on. But they also have over 18,000 hours of original local programming that is produced every year. So once again, I think the upside potential as when all things are working, also cylinders are working and we'll be able to take price up as the market allows. Thanks, Bob. Hi, Michael. I think you asked a question that's on the minds of every CFO and every senior management team of companies out there. Inflationary pressures are something we are all looking at and trying to assess, and think about how do we manage through it. This is also one that -- I just mentioned, we've already experienced in some parts of our business. So over the past year or so, we've talked about the increase in the price of content. You see the content, that because of just the competition for talent for everything that's involved in productions, content costs have gone up. Where we see it directly in our parks business is primarily through the hourly wage inflation that we've seen through contact -- contract renegotiation in our commitment to paying our park workers well.  And then we have things on the cost of goods side and it's interesting -- just last week maybe it was -- just last week I was talking to our Parks Senior Team about things we could do there, and there are lots of things that are worth talking about. We can adjust suppliers, we can substitute products, we can cut portion size which is probably good for some people's waistlines. We can look at pricing where necessary, but we aren't going to go just straight up across an increased prices. We're really going to try to get the algorithm right to cut where we can and not necessarily do things the same way.  As I mentioned, we're also using technology to reduce some of our operating costs, and that gives us a little bit of headroom also to absorb some inflation. But we're really trying to use our heads here to come up with a way to kind of mitigate some of these challenges that we have. It's a great question, and I'm sure it's one that you could ask every single Company in your coverage universe. Thanks. Okay. I'll take the advertising question, Jessica. So overall, the ad market is strong across our entire DMED portfolio. And the sports market is strong, and it's really being driven by football at both the college and professional level, NHL and the NBA. We are seeing some impact from supply chain issues impacting certain sales categories than the 2 that I would just call out are autos in technology and those are for obvious reasons that we all know about, the chip shortage. On Hulu specifically, we're really pleased with the advertising demand we've seen for Hulu. And we believe the overall addressable market in the U.S. market will continue to grow. Hulu, we believe also has some real strategic advantages in this space.  We've got a great slate of premium content and we've developed the ability to use our data to offer that targeting advertising, that advertisers really desire. And we also have a purpose built and unified ad platform. I mentioned this last quarter, but that's really helped us grow in addressable advertising. So we'll continue to make investments in technologies that are going to allow us to continue to exploit this advertising that we see on Hulu. And it's automating the sales process with programmatic, and advertisers self-service channels that we think are really going to continue to show good growth. So we expect advertising to continue to be an important driver of Hulu revenues going forward. Thanks."

            "name": "Bob Chapek",
            "content": "Thanks, Tammy, and good afternoon, everyone. As we close out the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to say that it's been a very productive year for The Walt Disney Company. As we've made great strides in reopening our business, while also taking meaningful and innovative steps to position ourselves for continued long-term growth. Despite the many ongoing challenges of the pandemic, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.37 compared to a loss of $0.20 last year. Christine will go more in-depth on the quarter and the coming year in her remarks. Last quarter, we talked about our strategic priorities for the future. And as we head into fiscal '22, we remain keenly focused on advancing them to drive our continued growth. First and foremost, telling the world's most original enduring stories. Second, maximizing the synergy of our unique ecosystem to deepen consumers' connection to our characters and our stories. And lastly, using the power of our far reaching platforms and new technologies to give consumers the best entertainment experience possible.  I'll briefly talk about how we are executing against these priorities in 3 key areas: Direct-to-Consumer, sports, and Parks, Experiences, and Products. On the Direct-to-Consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the success of our portfolio streaming services. Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu continue to perform incredibly well with a 118.1 million, 17.1 million, and 43.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of a 179 million subscriptions. To put this growth in perspective, in the past fiscal year alone, we have grown the total number of subscriptions across our DTC portfolio by 48%, and Disney+ subs in particular by 60%. I want to reiterate that we remain focused on managing our DTC business for the long-term, not quarter-to-quarter. And we're confident we are on the right trajectory to achieve the guidance that we provided at last year's Investors Day, reaching between 230 million and 260 million paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal year 2024, and with Disney+ achieving profitability that same year.  This Friday, we will celebrate the 2-year anniversary of the launch of Disney+ with our first ever Disney+ Day of global, Company-wide celebration. We are enormously proud of all that we've accomplished with the service in just the first 2 years. It has exceeded our wildest expectations, and we are so excited for what's to come. With this in mind, we have numerous activations planned across the entire Company for Disney+ Day, including the streaming premiere of Marvel Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings, which has already surpassed $430 million at the global box office. Other content coming to the service on Disney+ Day includes the highly anticipated Disney+ original movie, Home Sweet Home Alone, the epic adventure, Jungle Cruise, and a hilarious new short from The Simpsons, and the first 5 episodes of season 2 of the fantastic National Geographic series, The World According to Jeff Goldblum.  And there's more great content in the pipeline. On the heels of Disney+ Day, we'll premiere 2 amazing new original series, Marvel's Hawkeye on November 24th, and the latest Star Wars adventure, The Book of Boba Fett on December 29th. And of course, we're extremely excited about the Thanksgiving holiday weekend debut of The Beatles: Get Back, Peter Jackson's highly anticipated 3-part documentary. Additionally, Marvel's Eternals, which has reached more than $161 million at the global box office in less than a week and Disney's Encanto, which premieres in theaters on November 24th, will come to the service after their exclusive theatrical runs. In total, we are nearly doubling the amount of original content from our marquee brands, Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and National Geographic coming to Disney+ in FY '22, with the majority of our highly anticipated titles arriving July through September.  This represents the beginning of the surge of new content shared last December at our investor conference 2.0. We recognize that the single most effective way to grow our streaming platforms worldwide is with great content. And we are singularly focused on making new, high-quality entertainment, including local and regional content that we believe will resonate with audiences. Of note, we have 340 plus local original titles in various stages of development and production for our DTC platforms over the next few years. As you know, we announced at our last Investor Day that we expect our total content expense to be between $8 and $9 billion in fiscal 2024, and we will now be increasing that investment further with the primary driver being more local and regional content. We are expanding our global reach by introducing Disney+ in additional markets around the world.  The service is now available throughout Japan and we're thrilled to be launching it this Friday on Disney+ Day in South Korea, in Taiwan, and in Hong Kong on November 16. In just 2 short years, we're now in over 60 countries and more than 20 languages. And next year, we plan to bring Disney+ to consumers in 50 plus additional countries, including in Central, Eastern Europe, The Middle East, and South Africa. Our goal is to more than double the number of countries we are currently in to over 160 by fiscal year '23. Turning to Sports, we continue to build out ESPN+ with exclusive sports content that makes our DTC offering the perfect complement to the ESPN linear experience. And with every new sports rights deal, we have considered both linear and DTC. In fact, all 7 of the major deals we made in the last year-and-a-half included a streaming component.  Among them is our historic 10-year NFL rights agreement, which begins in 2023. We also recently signed a 5-year deal with the league for Monday night Wild Card game, which runs through 2025. Another example is our 7-year rights deal with the NHL, 75 of the League's live national games are and will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ is the sole home for more than 1,000 out-of-market NHL games. By the way, this is another reason that Disney Bundle is proving highly appealing to consumers. Because live sports are key element, and a key differentiator of our Disney ecosystem. Some 90% of the most-watched telecast last year were sports, and they continue to perform extremely well. For example, the NHL's opening night games on ESPN last month marked the highest viewed season opening doubleheader on record, with an increase of 54% over the 2019/2020 season opening day letter.  And we are particularly pleased with the NHL 's Direct-to-Consumer performance on ESPN+ and Hulu. Likewise, the hugely popular UFC, fresh off a strong card at Madison Square Garden last weekend, continues to be a top performer for ESPN+ with 6 of the top UFC on ESPN+ pay-per-views coming in the past year. At the same time, we continue to expand our original sports programming with innovative broadcast like the hugely popular Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli, which airs on ESPN2, and reached 1.9 million viewers by its second week, as well as the highly anticipated new shows like Man in the Arena: Tom Brady, the multi-part docuseries about the legendary quarterback premiering on ESPN+ on November 16, along with a host of fantastic new social and digital shows and podcast.  We're also moving towards a greater presence in online sports betting. And given our reaching scale, we have the potential to partner with third-parties in this space in a very meaningful way. Suffice to say, we continue to see enormous opportunity in sports, and all of this, the right steels, our innovative programming, and the flexibility achieved through our DTC business, which saw ESPN+ subscribers, increased by 66% over the past fiscal year alone. All of this is a testament to the clear ambition we have in sports. One of the things that sets The Walt Disney Company apart is our unique access to an incredible number of consumer touch points across our businesses. That, of course, includes our parks and resorts, where we've achieved a number of important milestones since our last earnings call, including the first full quarter since the pandemic began with all of our Parks around the world open to guests, albeit with some limits on capacity, and the return of our entire Disney Cruise Line.  At the same time, the U.S. government's approval of vaccines for 5 to 11-year-olds, and the reopening of borders to fully vaccinated international travelers are both important steps towards the recovery of our business. But what is perhaps most exciting is the work that we have done during the time our Parks were closed to re-engineer and re-imagine the guest experience. We have introduced a number of exciting new offerings that enable guests to create their best Disney Day. In late August, Disneyland Resort launched Magic Key, the new annual membership program that is resonating strongly with Legacy Annual Passholders, while also attracting new passholders. In fact, about 40% of current sales are to new passholders. And most Magic Key holders have purchased the top 2 tiers, Dream Key and Believe Key. With Dream Key selling out in just 2 months.  We're also seeing a great response to the new Annual Passholder program at Walt Disney World. A testament to the demand for our in-park experiences and the success of our yield management strategy. Walt Disney World rolled out its new multi-tiered full service app, Disney Genie, which allows guests to easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer in order to have the best experience possible. The response to the service in just its first month has been extremely positive. The majority of Genie and Genie+ users have said it improved their overall park experience with nearly 1/3 of park guests upgrading to Genie+, making it possible for them to spend less time waiting in line and more time enjoying attractions, entertainment, dining, and retail opportunities. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing and look forward to launching Disney Genie at Disneyland very soon.  Alongside these transformative programs, we continue to invest in our parks and resorts themselves. We introduced a host of new attractions as part of Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary celebration, which kicked off on October 1st. These include Remy's Ratatouille Adventure at EPCOT, which has quickly become one of the parks top attractions, our new themed restaurant SPACE 220, and Two New Nighttime Spectaculars. And there is lots more in store in the coming month, including the highly anticipated indoor coaster Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, and the one-of-a-kind Galactic Starcruiser experience. As part of this immersive 2-night adventure, guests will become heroes of their own Star Wars stories. Reservations went on sale just 3 weeks ago, and the first 4 months of voyages have virtually sold out for this premium experience.  Disney Cruise Line continues to be one of the highest rated guest experiences of any of our offerings. As I said earlier, all 4 of our ships are now sailing and we continue to see tremendous demand for the incredible experiences we offer at sea. We are thrilled to be launching a new ship, the Disney Wish in June of 2022 and will welcome her sister ships to the fleet in 2024 and 2025. Combined, these 3 vessels will help increase capacity and our footprint in a business that has historically generated a double-digit return on investment, driven by a premium price might well above the industry average. Before leaving our Parks and Experiences, I want to mention the continued transformation of our Consumer Products business. We have almost completed the reduction of our physical footprint, which will enable us to pivot our approach with a focus on our e-commerce platform, shopDisney, and on more compelling retail partnerships, such as Disney Store at Target, which will triple its locations by the end of the year.  In short, our parks around the globe now have more to offer guests than ever before, with our new offerings and we're making it even easier for them to have the best time imaginable, tailored specifically to their individual needs and preferences in a way, only Disney can. Our Company is truly unique and that we have a significant presence in the physical world through our parks and resorts, as well as media entertainment assets in the digital world. And it is incredible to see how our use of our emerging technology and insights gained through our innumerable consumer touch points, is enabling us to transform the way people interact with and experience our stories and products in both worlds. The Walt Disney Company has a long track record as an early adopter in the use of technology to enhance the entertainment experience.  Steamboat Willie, the first cartoon with synchronize sound, our groundbreaking development and use of Audio-Animatronics, we were the first to distribute downloaded content on the new Apple iPod back in 2005, Pixar has been a pioneer in computer animation, these are just a few examples. Suffice it to say, our efforts to-date are merely a prologue to a time when we'll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling without boundaries in our own Disney metaverse. And we look forward to creating unparalleled opportunities for consumers to experience everything Disney has to offer across our products and platforms wherever the consumer may be. As we look ahead to this next frontier, given our unique combination of brands, franchises, physical and digital experiences, and global reach, we see limitless potential, and that makes as excited as ever about The Walt Disney Company's next 100 years. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine, and she'll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the year ahead. Okay. Thank you, Ben. On the Disney+ side, as Christine had said, we're real pleased with where we're sitting. But again, it's not going to be a linear rate quarter to quarter. I think the recovery that you mentioned in terms of getting the growth rate back up to where it's been historically, is really going to come in the third and the fourth quarters. The third quarter will be powered, not necessarily by the content, but by the number of ads that we have in terms of markets. Our number of markets that we're going to add will essentially double to more than 160 by FY2023, and that will propel us in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter will be more of a function of that. Finally, the dam will break in terms of the content that we announced last December that will be substantial, and will lead to a cadence of content throughout the quarter that will look more like what we expect to see from an ongoing standpoint.  Obviously, we're only in year 2 of the Disney+ launch, and the hunger for content, for the service is extraordinary. And when you have that happen at the same time that you have a pandemic, and you have to shut down production. That's not a good combination. And yet we identified the need for the content way-back exactly a year ago, and have prepared a very strong cadence of content which will now hit the pipeline in the second half of this year. In terms of the park situation, we are very bullish. We're seeing incredible 30% increases in per caps, as I think was referenced in the earnings letter. And so we're not only seeing strong demand, but it's at per caps that are much higher than we've traditionally seen.  There was a reference and I am not sure if everyone appreciates the gravity of this to the Genie+ success, 1/3 of our guests at Walt Disney World, are buying the Genie+ upgrade at $15, that's per guest, per day. And that is a very, very material increase for in per-caps, but also in margins. So we're very bullish about both our Disney+ business, both in terms of  of guidance that has been given today. But additionally, in terms of where our Parks business is going to go from a demand standpoint once we completely clear the pandemic, but also in terms of the what we expect to be a long lasting benefits in terms of yields. Christine? Okay. As you know, we have preached flexibility in terms of making decisions on distribution as we recover from the pandemic and in the mix of changing consumer behaviors. The extent to which we had a number of titles release going to theatrical will eventually go to Disney+, but what we're seeing is some recovery of the theatrical exhibition marketplace, which is a good thing by the way, for not only Disney but also for the industry, and because most of the franchises that we've had as Walt Disney Company have been built through the theatrical exhibition channel of distribution. At the same time, we're watching very, very carefully different types of movies to see how the different components of the demographics of that market come back. And we're watching very carefully our family films, as they are released over the next couple of months to make sure that that market will come back to theatrical exhibition as the general entertainment with say the films that appeal to a younger target audience have come back.  And so we're sticking with our plan of flexibility, because we're still unsure in terms of how the marketplace is going to react when family films come back with a theatrical first window. I should say that -- you'll notice that the films that we are putting into the marketplace, in theatrical that are family films have a fairly short window, at least in terms of any reference point to what history might have been. And we're doing that so that we can get our films quicker to Disney+ and -- but at the same time see if the theatrical market can kick back into full gear as we prime the pump with these films. But we're going to do what's best for our shareholders ultimately. And we don't announce our films that far in advance, like we used to because we know that we're in a time of flux and change still. And while COVID will be in the rearview mirror, God-willing, I think changing consumer behavior is something that's going to be more permanent. And so we're reading that on a weekly basis and make our decisions going forward accordingly. So Michael, your first question was about the  of the supply chain  of new content coming into the service and its impact on our net sub adds. As you can probably suspect, in a world of to Direct-to-Consumer, we have a lot of information, a lot of data, and we have a pretty good idea of what the marginal impact of a particular title might be to our service, and we always say that library titles tend to increase engagement and minimize churn. But new titles, new content, whether the movies or series, add -- actually add new subs. And that is actually the reason why we're pretty confident that the increase in content flow towards the second half of fiscal '22 will actually lead to the types of results that we're anticipating. And so we've got some pretty good data that suggests that that is the case, given our history. While we only have two years, that two years has represented a number of titles, and you can start to build models as I'm sure you can understand.  Every time that we have a title, we have a pretty good idea of what the net impact that that's going to be, both from a retention and to an addition standpoint. So we're pretty confident that once we get to more of a normal content flow in the second half of the year that some of the vacuum that we've had over the last couple of months will not be the case. Christine, you want to handle the -- oh, and Charlie there was also a question about Cohorts widening. I'll handle that one as well. It is true that Disney+ is a 4 quadrant service. And as such, we need content that's going to be broad in order to appeal to each of those demographics. If there is an opportunity that we're working on right now, it's our preschool area. We believe that there's an opportunity for us to sort of assert ourselves in the Direct-to-Consumer way the same way we did in the Linear Networks with Disney Channel.  So that would be the biggest opportunity. And I can tell you that in sitting through our creator of reviews, the new content that we've got, the new storytelling that we've got in the area of preschool is absolutely extraordinary. And I think we're going to see a resurgence of Disney in that area in terms of content that's really going to become of the cultural zeitgeist, and then drive our subs amongst that particular cohort of potential sub-adds for Disney+. But it is true that being a 4-quadrant service, we need to be broad in our approach. And that's why we fired up the engines, the production engines of our Fox teams that we gotten in acquisitions  Searchlight, and just our general -- Disney General Entertainment team making content both for Hulu and for Disney+, as well as our services internationally. Christine? Okay. Will do. Jessica, you're right. We do believe that sports betting is a very significant opportunity for the Company, and it's all driven by the consumer. It's driven by the consumer, particularly the younger consumer that will replenish the sports fans over time and their desire to have gambling as part of their sports experience. It's not necessarily a lean-back, it's a little bit of a lean-forward type experience that they're looking for. And as we follow the consumer, we necessarily have to seriously consider getting into gambling in a bigger way. And ESPN is a perfect platform for this. We have done substantial research in terms of the impact to not only to ESPN brand, but the Disney brand in terms of consumers changing perceptions of the acceptability of gambling.  And what we're finding is that there's a very significant isolation. Gambling does not have the cache now that it had, say 10 or 20 years ago. And we have some concerns as a Company about our ability to get in it without having a brand withdrawal. But I can tell you that given all the research that we've done recently, that that is not the case. It actually strengthens the brand of ESPN when you have a betting component, and it has no impact on the Disney brand. Therefore, to go after that demographic opportunity plus the, of course, not insignificant revenue implications, that is something that we're keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively."

Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is also being webcast and we will post a transcript of this call to our website. Joining me remotely today are Bob Chapek, Disney\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we of course will be happy to take some of your questions. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Lowell, and hello, everyone. Today, I\u2019d like to start off by talking about our Company\u2019s priorities for the future. As has been the case for Disney\u2019s nearly 100-year history, it all begins with great storytelling, which is the foundation of our special connection to audiences and guests. And our foremost priority will continue to be to tell the world\u2019s most original and enduring stories brought to life by the world\u2019s most talented creators. As home to some of the most beloved franchises, we will maximize the synergy of our unique ecosystem to further deepen consumers\u2019 connection to our characters and stories. And we will use the power of our far-reaching platforms and emerging technologies to better anticipate what our consumers want and deliver them a more seamless and more personalized entertainment experience. We are executing against these priorities, and results clearly speak for themselves. Looking across the Company over the past quarter, we are pleased with the trajectory we are on as we continue to grow our businesses, despite the challenges presented by the ongoing everchanging COVID-19 pandemic. We ended the third fiscal quarter in a strong position, with adjusted EPS up tenfold to $0.80 compared to $0.08 last year. At our Parks, Experiences and Products business, we\u2019re encouraged by some of the positive trends we\u2019re seeing, and new developments we have been hard at work on, including the brand-new Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure, where guests can team up with their favorite superheroes in thrilling ways. At our international parks, Shanghai is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year with great fanfare, and we welcome the first guests to our reimagined Marvel themed hotel at Disneyland Paris. Meanwhile, work continues on a wide array of new experiences, including the one-of-a-kind Star Wars themed Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World. And as part of a multiyear transformation of EPCOT, we\u2019ll soon introduce our extraordinary new nighttime spectacular Harmonious. Last month, we completed our first cruise since the start of the pandemic with the Disney Magic, which is currently sailing short-term staycations for UK residents. And the Disney Dream set sail on its first U.S.-based cruise this week. Future bookings for all of our ships remain strong, with bookings in the third quarter in particular, having benefited from the announcement of our fall 2022 itineraries and the successful marketing launch of our fifth ship, the Disney Wish, which will set sail in summer of 2022. As our parks business continues its recovery and we see demand grow, we are now putting into action some of the amazing guest-centric services that we have been developing over the last few years. These include Magic Key, our recently announced new annual pass membership program at Disneyland. It provides great value and a variety of options for our guests, and will be available starting on August 25th. The reaction to the news from fans has been extremely positive. Additionally, we\u2019ve made significant investments in sophisticated technology and tools, creating a revolutionary new multi-tiered service, we\u2019re calling Disney Genie, that will enable our guests to more easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer. We\u2019re very, very excited about this new service, and we\u2019ll be providing additional detail soon. The goal of Disney Genie, which will appear in a user-friendly app, is to create a better, more personalized and customized experience for guests, putting them in control and providing even greater flexibility and choice. They\u2019ll be able to spend less time waiting in line and figuring out what attractions or dining options are available, and more time having fun. On the direct-to-consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the continuing success of our portfolio of streaming services. Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu have performed incredibly well with 116 million 14.9 million and 42.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of nearly 174 million subscriptions. Numerous breakout hits from our beloved brands, including Pixar\u2019s Luca and Marvel\u2019s Loki and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier have contributed to strong engagement and new subscriber growth in core Disney+ markets. And we have continued to launch Disney+ in new markets around the world, including Disney+ Hotstar in Malaysia and Thailand in Q3. Disney+ is also currently available in a limited capacity in Japan and will expand to the full market in late October, followed by additional APAC markets, including South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in mid-November. The launch of Disney+ in Eastern Europe has moved from late 2021 to summer of 2022, primarily to allow for an expanded footprint that will include parts of the Middle East and South Africa. Additionally, we\u2019re excited about the launch of Star+ throughout Latin America later this month. As we\u2019ve said, our direct-to-consumer business is the Company\u2019s top priority. And among our unique advantages in promoting and growing our DTC service are our powerhouse brands and the vast array of direct consumer touch points we have across our businesses, from our media networks to our theme parks to our consumer products. This synergy enables us to raise consumer awareness and further increase engagement with our streaming services. And the power of this synergy will be on full display on November 12 when we celebrate Disney+ Day with an unprecedented Company-wide cross-promotional campaign. Our robust pipeline of content continues to fuel growth, and we have an incredible lineup of new programming for Disney+. On Thanksgiving Day, we are thrilled to be premiering the first of Peter Jackson\u2019s highly anticipated six-episode Beatles documentary, Get Back. We also have exciting new series from Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic coming later this year, including Marvel\u2019s Hawkeye, starring Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld; The Mandalorian Spin-Off, The Book of Boba Fett and National Geographic\u2019s, Welcome to Earth with Will Smith. With respect to our current approach to distributing our feature-length films, last year, in light of the prolonged and unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we needed to find alternative ways to bring our movies to consumers while theaters were closed. And once they began to reopen, there was still widespread reluctance to return. Therefore, we adopted a three-pronged strategy for releasing our films that consisted of theatrical releases, direct to Disney+ and a hybrid of theatrical plus premier access as we did with Cruella, Jungle Cruise and Marvel\u2019s Black Widow, the top-performing film at the domestic box office since the start of the pandemic. Both, Bob Iger and I, along with the leaders of our creative and distribution teams, determined this was the right strategy because it would enable us to reach the broadest possible audience. And just to reiterate, distribution decisions are made on a phone by phone basis based on global marketplace conditions and consumer behavior. We will continue to utilize all available options going forward, learn from insights gained with each release and innovate accordingly, while always doing what we believe is in the best interest of the film and the best interest of our constituents. We have an incredible slate of upcoming theatrical films, starting with Free Guy which premiers tomorrow, followed by Marvel\u2019s newest action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings on September 3rd. The highly anticipated live-action musical, West Side Story from Steven Spielberg, is set for December as is the Kingsman, a prequel in the popular Kingsman series. We have Disney Animation Studios\u2019 Encanto, an incredibly heartwarming story set into magical town in Colombia and featuring music by the incomparable Lin-Manuel Miranda. Our Marvel slate includes four feature films in fiscal 2022, the all-new Eternals, alongside sequels to Doctor Strange, Thor and Black Panther. A brand new Indiana Jones Adventure starring Harrison Ford, is due in the summer, as is the origin story of another Intrepid Explorer in Lightyear, a spin-off of the beloved Toy Story franchise. It\u2019s a widely appealing slate with something for everybody. Our goal is always to provide guests and consumers with unparalleled entertainment, whether they\u2019re visiting one of our parks or watching one of our films in a theater or on our streaming platforms. And as we continue our recovery, we believe we are taking the right steps to further this goal while growing our businesses and increasing shareholder value. Personally, I am as optimistic as ever about the future of our Company. We have a robust and growing portfolio of DTC services powered by the world\u2019s best storytellers and greatest brands and franchises, and the parks business, which extend those stories and creates a place where magic comes to life in a more guest-friendly way than ever. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Christine and she\u2019ll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the way ahead.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.80, an increase of $0.72 from the prior year quarter. I\u2019ll walk through our results today by segment, starting with Parks, Experiences and Products where we continued to benefit from improvements and recovery at our parks and resorts as well as at consumer products. Segment operating income at DPEP in Q3 increased by $2.2 billion year-over-year. At parks and experiences, we continued to benefit in the third quarter from the reopening of our sites around the world. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for the entire third quarter. Whereas in the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World was closed for the entire quarter, and Shanghai Disney was open for 48 days. Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris were open for 72 days and 19 days, respectively, in the third quarter versus 10 days and zero days in the prior year quarter. And Disneyland Resort was opened for 65 days during the third quarter and was closed for all of the prior year quarter. At Walt Disney World, third quarter attendance levels were generally at or near our daily capacity levels, which increased throughout the quarter. Disneyland Resort also steadily increased attendance and capacity following its reopening at the end of April and particularly after the lifting of California state restrictions on June 15th. Guest spending at our domestic parks has been exceptionally strong, with third quarter per cap up significantly versus fiscal 2019 at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. Guest spend has benefited from pent-up demand and favorable guest mix, driving higher admissions per cap as well as from spending on products related to Star Wars, Galaxy\u2019s Edge and Avengers Campus. Looking forward, theme park reservations at both of our domestic parks remain strong, and we continue to utilize our yield management strategy to deliver the optimal guest experience and provide flexibility to our guests during these dynamic times, all while driving economic margin for our shareholders. At consumer products, improved results year-over-year were driven by growth at both our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. Growth in merchandise licensing was primarily due to higher revenue from merchandise, based on several of our key franchises, including Mickey and Minnie, Star Wars, including the Mandalorian, Disney Princess and Spider-Man. The increase in retail was due to higher results at Disney stores, most of which were closed in the prior year quarter as well as a comparison to the impairment of store assets in the prior year quarter. Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. Third quarter operating income decreased by about $1 billion versus the prior year as improved results at direct-to-consumer were offset by declines at Linear Networks and Content Sales/Licensing and Other. At Linear Networks, operating results were lower at both, our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in operating income at cable was due to higher programming and production costs and higher marketing costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. As we called out last quarter, the increase in Q3 programming and production costs was due to the return of live sports at ESPN, driven by the NBA and Major League Baseball. In the prior year quarter, a significant number of live sporting events were canceled or delayed due to COVID-19. At broadcasting, lower results from the ABC television network were only partially offset by growth at our owned television stations. The decrease at ABC was largely due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. The increase in programming and production costs was due to an increase in the average cost of programming and the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in the third quarter compared to the second quarter in the prior fiscal year. Domestic advertising revenue increased year-over-year at both, cable and broadcasting, driven by favorable comparisons versus the prior year due to COVID-19. At cable, the increase was driven by ESPN, where third quarter advertising revenue increased by $400 million versus the prior year, reflecting the return of live sporting events. Q4-to-date, domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above prior year. But bear in mind that this comparison is complicated by various COVID and timing impacts from the prior year. We\u2019re not going to provide a forecast for the quarter, but the underlying sports ad marketplace remains strong for us, particularly in the quarter in which the Olympics were held. At broadcasting, higher advertising results were primarily driven by increased rates and the timing of the Academy Awards, which benefited both, the owned television stations and ABC. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 4% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Results at international channels declined due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising revenue. Both of these factors were impacted by the return of live sporting events and in particular, the Indian Premier League, which held cricket matches from April 9th until the season was postponed on May 4th versus no matches in the prior year quarter due to COVID-19. Turning to Direct-to-Consumer. Q3 operating income improved by over $300 million versus the prior year, driven by Hulu, partially offset by a higher loss at Disney+. The increase at Hulu was due to growth in subscription and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming costs related to Hulu Live. Hulu ended the third quarter with 42.8 million paid subscribers, up from 41.6 million in Q2, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live decreased slightly to 3.7 million from 3.8 million at the end of Q2. At Disney+, operating results decreased versus the prior year due to higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs, driven by the ongoing expansion of the service. These higher costs were partially offset by increased subscription revenue, reflecting subscriber growth and increases in retail pricing as well as Premier Access revenue for Cruella. Note that Disney+ Premier Access revenue is included in our DTC operating results but is excluded for the purposes of calculating ARPU. As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the third quarter with 116 million global paid subscribers to Disney+, up from approximately $104 million in the second quarter. Disney+ Hotstar accounted for the majority of our net subscriber additions between Q2 and Q3, making up a little less than 40% of our total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the third quarter. However, subscriber growth was also solid at our core Disney+ markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, with total quarter-over-quarter net adds in those markets consistent with net adds from Q2. Disney+\u2019s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.16. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.12 or an increase of about $0.50 versus the second quarter, reflecting a benefit from the recent price increases, both domestically and abroad. Disney+ Hotstar ARPU also increased from Q2 to Q3 due to higher ad revenue per subscriber, reflecting the roughly four weeks of IPL matches that were played in Q3 versus none in Q2. At ESPN+, operating results in the quarter were comparable versus the prior year. ESPN+ ended Q3 with 14.9 million paid subscribers, reflecting over 1 million net subscriber additions versus the second quarter. Content Sales/Licensing and Other operating income at DMED decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year due to lower home entertainment and theatrical distribution results. The decrease in home entertainment results was due to lower unit sales of new release titles, reflecting the performance of Raya and the Last Dragon and Soul in the third quarter compared to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Frozen II, Onward, Call of the Wild, and Ford v. Ferrari in the prior year quarter, along with lower catalog sales. The decrease in theatrical distribution results was primarily due to higher marketing expense for future releases and lower operating income from titles in release. Looking ahead, there are a handful of items I would like to mention, as you think about our fourth quarter. At Linear Networks, we expect fourth quarter operating income to decline versus the prior year, reflecting incremental marketing and programming costs at ABC and FX, in addition to an adverse comparison to last year\u2019s benefit from the 53rd week. The increase in marketing and programming expenses at ABC and FX is driven by more than twofold increase in the number of series premieres versus the prior year quarter as productions in the prior year were impacted by COVID. As it relates to the 53rd week, recall that last year, we estimated a benefit of approximately $200 million to the Company, which primarily impacted our Linear Networks. At Content Sales/Licensing and Other, we are expecting an operating loss in the fourth quarter, driven by a number of items, including higher marketing and distribution costs in the theatrical window due to more titles being released versus the prior year, in addition to lower results from home entertainment and third-party content licensing. We now expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to be approximately $200 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by increased spending for facilities across the enterprise and technology for our DTC services. And finally, in light of the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our continued prioritization of investments that support our growth initiatives, the Board decided not to declare or pay a dividend for the first half of fiscal 2021. Longer term, we do anticipate that both, dividends and share repurchases will remain a part of our capital allocation strategy. However, for the time being, we don\u2019t anticipate declaring a dividend or repurchasing shares until we return to a more normalized operating environment and our leverage is back to levels more consistent with a single A credit rating. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Christine. And once again, as we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&A by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Lowell, I\u2019ll let you choose the speakers, but here are the questions. One is, I wanted to understand how the Company is thinking about near-term theatrical releases, given the steep fall-off in second week box, rise of the Delta variant, international markets still not opened. So why not delay or pause release schedule? And then, secondly, on DTC profits, I guess, more Hulu profits, it looks like continually they\u2019re getting better than expected. I think you turned profitable this quarter with Hulu. So, I\u2019m wondering why that improvement and why not revisit maybe some of the guidance that we shared earlier on DTC profitability, just given the continual improvement in it looks like Hulu profitability? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Michael, thank you for those questions. I\u2019ll turn the first one over to Bob and then Christine can address the Hulu profitability question.\nBob Chapek: Michael, as you probably recognize, we live in a very uncertain world in terms of the recovery of some of our markets in the theatrical exhibition world. It\u2019s certainly part of that. We\u2019ve said from the very beginning that we value flexibility in being able to make as last-minute calls as we can, given what we see in the marketplace. And certainly, when we planned our schedule that we\u2019re executing right now, we did not anticipate, nor did I think anybody, the resurgence of COVID with the Delta variant that would have such a significant impact on the marketplace. At the same time, when you work in an ecosystem, having a lot of partners, they need to be able to plan their business, too. And so, at some point, we have to put a stake in the ground and say, for example, Shang-Chi, that\u2019s going to be a title that we\u2019re going to put in the marketplace or Free Guy, that\u2019s going to be a title that we\u2019re going to put into the marketplace. Not knowing, again, three months earlier when you make that commitment, what exactly the marketplace is going to look like. But, what I do think that says, Michael, it says that we value flexibility and we value to follow where the consumer is going to go. And while some of that\u2019s uncertain, I think, in terms of relative to where the rest of the market is, you see that we\u2019ve got more flexibility in terms of how we program. And nothing is in stone because the marketplace is rapidly changing. But at some point, you\u2019ve got to put a stake in the ground and say, this is what we\u2019re going to do. And that\u2019s where we ended up on Shang-Chi and Free Guy, which are our next two titles out.\nMichael Nathanson: Bob, can I just follow-up? Why wouldn\u2019t you just add from your access, given what you saw happen, I think, successfully with Black Widow to those two titles?\nBob Chapek: Okay. Good questions. On Free Guy, obviously, this is a title that we acquired under a different distribution assumption and set of agreements. So, we don\u2019t have the degree of freedom to do that on Free Guy. On Shang-Chi, we think it\u2019s actually going to be an interesting experiment for us because it\u2019s got only a 45-day window for us. So, the prospect of being able to take a Marvel title to the service after going theatrical with 45 days will be yet another data point to inform our actions going forward on our titles. But once again, I\u2019ll refer back to my previous answer. When we planned Shang-Chi, that title was planned on being in a much more healthy theatrical environment. And at this point, unfortunately, due to distribution agreements that we have and due to just the practicalities of last-minute changes, it wouldn\u2019t be possible.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: I\u2019ll take your question on Hulu, Michael. You\u2019re absolutely correct. Hulu exceeded our expectations, and it was profitable this quarter. There\u2019s a couple of things going on here. One is, it has had -- continued to have subscriber growth and also very strong advertising revenue. The advertising is coming from higher sell-through rates, a lot of addressable advertising and a significant ramp-up in the dynamic ad insertion technology that we have within Hulu Live. So, those are things that are driving it. And at the same time, they are just like all of our other streaming services, they\u2019re ramping up their production, programming and also marketing expense to promote those new shows. So, we\u2019re very pleased with what\u2019s going on at Hulu, but we\u2019re not going to update our guidance yet because we are in the process of doing our fiscal \u201822 annual operating plan. And if we feel that we have to update it after we complete that, we will certainly do it.\nMichael Nathanson: Thank you, guys.\nLowell Singer: And Michael, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlexia Quadrani: My questions are on the parks side, if I can. I guess, the first one is, we\u2019ve seen really, really much improved results this quarter. And moving forward, I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing any recent impact from the Delta variant in the domestic or international parks may be cause for concern, particularly as you\u2019re increasing capacity. And then, just staying on the parks, maybe you can elaborate on how we should view sort of longer-term profitability, given the improvements you\u2019re able to make in terms of automating many aspects of the parks during COVID or while they were closed. But now, maybe with heightened cleaning expenses perhaps staying for a while and other expenses related to COVID staying for a while, given how this variant has continued to kind of make COVID still very much part of our lifestyle. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: All right. Alexia, thanks for the question. So Bob, maybe you talk about Delta\u2019s impact on parks and you may want to talk about leading in Alexia\u2019s second question, some of the yield stuff we\u2019ve been doing. And Christine, you probably want to follow-up on the second part.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of impact of the Delta variant, we see strong demand for our parks continuing. And the primary noise that we\u2019re seeing right now are really around group or convention cancellations. In other words, large groups that are coming in relatively short-term. But on the whole, we see really strong demand for our parks. In fact, our park reservations now are above our Q3 attendance levels. And as you just saw with our earnings announcement, our Q3 attendance levels were pretty darn good. So, we\u2019re still bullish about our park business going forward. I may also suggest, as a bridge to the second question that we\u2019ve implemented a reservation system that\u2019s going to enable us to spread our demand, increase our yield and improve our guest experience at the same time. And in terms of the long-lasting impacts that you mentioned, I think some of the cost implications that we need to do for hygienic purposes are going to be relatively short-lived. And frankly, in the grand scheme of operating our parks, not all that material. But what will be the long-lasting impact is the improvements that we\u2019re making with guest personalization and guest choice, therefore, affecting the tremendous yield benefits that we\u2019ve been able to extract over the last few quarters. And that\u2019s only going to grow in the future with our ability to really do world-class yield management systems through our new reservation system.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi Alexia. And I\u2019d add to that a couple of things. One is, we have seen very, very strong per caps in addition to all the yield management things Bob mentioned. But the per caps, in my comments, I referred to them as exceptionally strong. And I would not use that word were it not for the fact that they were exceptional. Last quarter, I said that they were up strong double-digit and this quarter was even stronger. If you look at - when a park is closed for a long period of time, as Disneyland was, as Paris was, when they reopen, the per caps really shoot up. And we still have, even though Walt Disney World isn\u2019t open now for over a year, we\u2019re still seeing extremely strong per cap growth continue at that park. So, in addition to all the technology things that we\u2019re implementing, as Bob mentioned, reservation systems, the dining apps, we\u2019re just seeing the consumer behavior be very favorable. And the guest experience is something that we\u2019re going to be focused on, especially as we continue to reopen.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Alexia, thanks for the questions today. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good afternoon. A couple probably for Christine. Christine, I was wondering if you could give us the Hulu advertising growth in the quarter. I think, you\u2019ve given that to us in prior quarters. And then, also, just are you expecting the IPL to come back in September at this point? And any update on the Latin American sports situation, since that\u2019s part of your launch there. And then, if I can ask Bob a parks question just on technology. You mentioned the Disney Genie. How substantial of a sort of an improvement or evolution in the guest experience are you expecting to bring to market? And then MyMagic+ is pretty -- it\u2019s been around for a while. And I\u2019m just wondering if you think there\u2019s a real transformation ahead for the business as you take advantage of the last year-plus of downtime to reinvent the experience? Just maybe add some context would be helpful.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Ben, thanks for the questions. Thank you, Ben. I think, we\u2019ll start with, Bob, if you want to talk a little bit about some of the technology at the parks, and then we\u2019ll go to Christine to talk about Hulu ad growth, IPL and LatAm.\nBob Chapek: Okay. Ben, you used the correct word, transformational. MyMagic+ was us basically sticking our toe in the pond of this type of transformational work. Disney Genie though is that program on steroids. This is going to revolutionize our guest experience. Guests are going to spend less time waiting and more time having fun in our parks with a dramatically improved guest experience. That\u2019s going to make their navigation of their day and their planning of their day much easier. Essentially, what it\u2019s going to do is take the consumer preferences that we know from our consumers, given what we know from them, and blend that with basically industrial engineering data that we\u2019ve got in terms of how our park is operating that day and meld those together to make suggestions on the fly that not only will lead to that improved guest experience, but at the same time lead to substantial commercial opportunities as the guest navigates their base. So, it certainly qualifies in my mind for both materiality and transformational impact on our business from a yield standpoint.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Ben, I\u2019ll try to go through your -- hope I can remember them all. So, Hulu. Hulu did have very strong advertising growth in the quarter, and we continue to see that growth quarter after quarter. We haven\u2019t specifically quantified it, but I would say that it is driven by higher impressions as well as rates. And as I mentioned, the ability for us to use the dynamic ad insertion in Hulu Live is also a benefit. I think, the advertising sales team, if they had more inventory, they could certainly sell it. There\u2019s that much demand for it. Just to put some context around it, because I think it\u2019s a precursor of what the upfront showed is that the -- we came out of a very strong upfront but we had about 40% of the total upfront dollars into streaming and digital. And a lot of that is not only across Hulu, but also across our other entertainment and sports platforms. So, I think that just shows that the kind of advertising that\u2019s going through Hulu is certainly a growth driver. The IPL is coming back. It\u2019s scheduled to come back on September 19, and it will run through, I believe, the last final match is scheduled for mid-October, around October 15. When you think about Disney+ Hotstar, IPL is certainly a very, very important component of the offerings, but it\u2019s only one because we also have a very broad portfolio of general entertainment as well as other sports. It has a lot of original content, library content in it from all of the Disney+ brands and IP. And we added over 18,000 of original local programming every year. So, we feel really good about not only the IPL but also Star -- Hotstar+. In LatAm, we will be -- LatAm, the launch for LatAm is in later this quarter. But I don\u2019t have any updates to anything new on the sports side.\nOperator: Next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: So, two questions. It\u2019s certainly nice to see the U.S. parks profitable in fiscal 3Q. And I note that operating expenses are back at 81% of 2019 fiscal 3Q levels, while revenues about 60% of 2019 levels. And that seems consistent with commentary that you made in the past that you have to ramp overhead in advance of consumers coming back to the park. So, my question is, is the overhead now sort of re-ramped at the Parks? Should we look at this as the right overhead level? And from here, it\u2019s variable cost growing with consumers continuing to come back, and that\u2019s how we should think about modeling the parks going forward? And then, the second area is just on streaming. I hope you could discuss the health of Disney+. How was engagement trending in the quarter? How was churn playing in the quarter? What was the impact of Star as you merged in with Disney+ in Europe? And anything else you want to note on the health of Disney+ would be appreciated. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Doug, thanks for the questions. Bob, you may want to start on the streaming question, and I don\u2019t know if you want to make some comments on kind of parks\u2019 cost ramp. And then, Christine, you may want to jump in on that as well.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the health of Disney+, we feel really great about our sub trajectory. We\u2019ve got world-class content from the world\u2019s best storytellers, plus our international launches, plus the power of the Disney bundle. And you asked the question about churn. We\u2019re really pleased with churn. We\u2019ve taken some price increases over the past few quarters. And what you\u2019re seeing is that our churn has declined, including in Latin America where we went up -- I mean by -- in Europe, sorry, by \u20ac2 when we added Star brand as a sixth brand tile. So, our retention is very healthy across the globe. We\u2019re really, really pleased with that. And I think, again, it really goes back to the price value that we\u2019re offering our guests. When you take out Luca, Loki, Falcon and the Winter Soldier. There\u2019s something essentially new each week. You blend that together with a tremendous local investment that we\u2019re making in our international territories. And it\u2019s really a price value proposition that is really great. So, the fact that our churn is so low, our engagement is so high, our retention is so high amongst the local corridors where we\u2019re taking price increases, I think, says everything about it. In terms of -- and I\u2019ll start this off, Christine, on the cost side and what we expect to see in terms of our parks profitability. But right now, you can use a lot of different metrics to look at our business. In California, we\u2019ve got all three of our hotels open, for example. We\u2019ve got 70% of our available rooms open in Walt Disney World. So, you can see that we\u2019re not quite 100% available at this point. But, I think that a lot of the costs from here on out are variable. Obviously, as we scale our business and we get up closer and closer to 100% capacity, our efficiencies and operating become much, much higher. So, I think you\u2019ll see disproportionate benefit as we go from here on. Christine, I don\u2019t know if you want to elaborate.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. I would just add that our parks -- our plan -- and once again, this is -- we\u2019ll monitor the trends with what\u2019s going on with the Delta variant. But, we\u2019re expecting to have our parks domestically be fully staffed up by the end of this calendar year, calendar 2021. And we\u2019re going to be increasing capacities as we have the demand, and we\u2019re also being able to train -- thoroughly train our employees as they come back in. And once again, this is an ever-changing landscape with COVID, but we\u2019re going to be particularly careful, and we\u2019re also going to bring our capacity online aggressively, but measured. We\u2019re not just going to open up the doors and flung them open. So, we\u2019re doing this in a measured fashion for the health and safety of not only our guests, but also our cast members in the parks.\nLowell Singer: Doug, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thanks. I have one on Disney+ and one of film. You mentioned that you\u2019re opening in Japan, fully opening in Japan in October. It\u2019s such a big country with a huge affinity for everything Disney. I mean, the Parks are doing really well there, and it\u2019s a very affluent country. So, just wondering if you could give us any color on market size and ARPU. And then, on film, the industry has undergone such massive change over the last two years towards streaming. But obviously, the pandemic has had a big impact, but it was moving in that direction anyway. With the jury out on like how much the box office will come back to pre-COVID levels, how do you think about the success of a film in today\u2019s environment? And how does that impact the way you attract talent, the way you compensate talent? And what changes do you expect to make, if any, in your film strategy from here?\nLowell Singer: Okay. Jessica, thanks a lot. Bob, why don\u2019t you take the film question? I don\u2019t know if you want to make any comments on Japan? And Christine, you may want to jump in on that one as well.\nBob Chapek: Okay. Obviously, this world has been disrupted by COVID, and we\u2019re all reacting to a very fluid situation in terms of the marketplace. We\u2019re very grateful for the fact that we had the ability to take out a lot of titles, both not only in the theatrical marketplace for those that prefer to watch a film that way, but also at the same time through our Disney Premier Access, and that was a winning strategy for us to give consumers the choice for those that decided that going back to a theater was not for them at the same time. That said, these films, Jessica, were really conceived under a time when we did not know what was going to be happening with consumer behavior three, four years later and certainly didn\u2019t know about COVID at the time. So, we\u2019re dealing under a different sort of set of conditions than we thought. What I will say is that just like we\u2019ve done many times before, as the business has evolved and transformed, we\u2019ve figured out ways to fairly compensate our talent, so that no matter what the business model is that we have to go to market with, everybody feels satisfied. And I will say that since COVID has begun, we\u2019ve entered into hundreds of talented arrangements with our talent. And by and large, they\u2019ve gone very, very smoothly. So, we expect that, that would be the case going forward. Certainly, this is a time of anxiety the marketplace as a lot has changed recently. And again, these films that we\u2019re releasing right now were imagined under a completely different environment than unfortunately, the fate has delivered us. But, we\u2019re trying to do the best thing for all our constituents and make sure that everybody who\u2019s in the value chain, if you will, feels like they\u2019re having their contractual commitments honored, both from a distribution and a compensation standpoint. What I\u2019ll say before I turn it over to Christine on Japan is that remember that heretofore, as we\u2019ve launched Disney+ around the world, in Japan, we\u2019ve done it with a fairly limited distribution system and that\u2019s about the change going forward. But at the same time, that market is under, as they call it, a state of emergency. And that certainly has disrupted that marketplace as we go from a fairly limited distribution now to a much more broad distribution. Christine?\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. Jessica, we fully agree with your assessment of the market and the high degree of affinity that the Japanese market has for Disney IP. So, we\u2019re totally agreeing. We did, as Bob say, a soft launch with a partner last year, but it was only to a small part of the market, and we\u2019re really excited to do the full launch that will be in this coming October for Disney+. And we\u2019ll see how that goes, but we have been very cautiously optimistic as we always are, but we believe that that IP is going to resonate. We don\u2019t, as you know, break out ARPU by individual markets. So, we\u2019ll just be giving you the Disney+ ARPUs the way we currently are doing it.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citi.\nJason Bazinet: So, I think your digital pivot is incredible, impressive. But I want to ask a question that will come across as bearish and it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s an honest question. I think in the salad days of pay TV, maybe we had, I don\u2019t know, 75%, 80% pay TV penetration and people who were paying U.S. households $70 a month or something. And the most mature SVOD platform out there is probably at 50% penetration with ARPUs that are sort of one-fifth of pay TV ARPUs and not really growing. And I just wonder what -- if you guys have any thoughts on what that means for the broader sort of digital pivot? And are there things that the industry needs to do as an example, if you think it\u2019s tethered to piracy or something like that that could sort of give you another -- or the industry, including you another leg of growth in terms of net adds that people aren\u2019t thinking about? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: So, Bob, do you want to take that? Thanks, Jason, for the question, by the way.\nBob Chapek: Jason, I\u2019d like to think of it like we\u2019re in the first inning of the first game of a very long season. We\u2019ve not even been at this right now as Disney, at least for two full years. Despite that two full years, as you suggested, we\u2019ve gone into 61 countries in 21 months. So, we\u2019re very proud of that and we\u2019re proud of the success that we\u2019ve had. I would caution not to come to any conclusions about the size of the market. We\u2019ve got a TAM of 1.1 billion households across the globe. And we\u2019ve only just begun our journey. And as I think you see, what\u2019s really going to make the difference for Disney is our spectacular content told by the best storytellers against our powerhouse franchises. You put that in the context of also all the local investments that we\u2019re making. And I think we\u2019re going to have a bright future ahead. And I understand the benchmark that you\u2019re using, but I think this is a different marketplace. And I think we\u2019re charging forward to maximize the opportunity, given our unique combinations of not only distribution platforms, but intellectual property and storytelling.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: Earlier, Bob, you were talking about the power of the Disney bundle. And in the U.S., you\u2019ve really taken a bundle-centric approach to the market. I was hoping you can give us some insight into that power. Whatever you can share to help us understand, why the bundle is so successful, either the portion of your subs, Disney+ subs that are in the bundle or the portion of the gross adds or engagement, whatever you can offer would be great. And then, just expanding on that a little bit, if the bundle really does appear to be the most compelling product in the portfolio, why not just make it the core product and eliminate the complexity to the consumer in terms of thinking about which elements of the Disney entertainment ecosystem they want and just give it all to them at once? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Brett, thanks for the questions. I\u2019ll turn them over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the bundle, you see that the majority are not -- maybe not the majority, but a good chunk of our marketing now is going towards a bundle. And that\u2019s because the -- while we enjoy extremely low churn rates on our individual services, the churn rates on the bundle are even lower, surprisingly low even for us. And I think what that says is that our customers enjoy the price value of the bundle that we offer and getting an incredible amount of content for a really good price. While I can\u2019t comment on some of the specific percentages that you\u2019re probably looking for, but I will make a comment on sort of going forward. You noticed that across the world, we\u2019ve got different business models. We\u2019ve got different business models for two reasons. Number one, the unique situation that we find ourselves in each market whether it\u2019s Europe or LatAm or Asia or North America tend to be different in terms of what rights we have and what the consumers are actually looking for. But that also gives us an opportunity to test out different propositions. Obviously, the proposition that we have in Europe with Star as a 6-brand title looks significantly different than our relatively unbundled approach that we have in North America. Again, we\u2019re in the first inning of the first game of all the long season, and we\u2019re taking all this into account. There may also be certain constraints that were under that could, at least from a short-term standpoint, limit our ability do what long-term we might feel was ideal. But frankly, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s ideal yet. I will say that we\u2019re extremely pleased in every market that we\u2019ve launched our direct-to-consumer services. We\u2019ve exceeded our expectations in every marketplace. So, in terms of the way that we\u2019ve approached the market so far, it\u2019s worked really, really well. Is there an opportunity for improvement by considering something different going forward? Possibly. But, we\u2019re going to continue to learn. And as we learn, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll refine our offerings in the marketplace, as time goes on.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Brett, for the questions. Operator, given the time, I think we will take our final question.\nOperator: Sure. Our final question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Maybe the 2024 guide, I think, included 30% of subs coming from Hotstar. I mean, given the strength in Hotstar, does that guidance still hold? And then, given the content release schedule that we have in the second half of the year, do you expect the net add trends in what I\u2019d call the core Disney+ markets to improve in the back half? And then lastly, just anything you could tell us on just Disney+ Day in November in terms of how you expect to promote? Is it global or U.S. or just -- or any new content that could be launched that day, anything you could tell us on that would be great?\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, John, for the question. Bob, why don\u2019t you start on Disney+ Day and then Christine, you can take the question about Hotstar guide, et cetera.\nBob Chapek: Okay. Disney+ Day will be a balanced approach between global and local product. We\u2019re going to have a real exciting lineup, as you might guess, as we approach those consumers who have not yet signed up for Disney+ with a really attractive group of titles to be announced. But, I think it gives us an opportunity to provide a focal point for consumers that have not yet tripped over to Disney+. And I think it\u2019s going to give us a focal point of excitement and energy that will not only pay benefits in the U.S., but globally as well. In terms of the net add question and how that\u2019s going to improve, first half versus second half, again, we feel really great about our sub trajectory. As we learn, though, we\u2019re finding out there\u2019s tremendous seasonality in this business that we may not have known about before we really got into it, or at least in terms of above expectations. Also, I want to caveat that our sub adds aren\u2019t necessarily going to be linear. I think a lot of the marketplace expects these things to sort of be a straight-line math, and it\u2019s not really turning out that way. And as we\u2019ve indicated before, we do believe our first half adds this fiscal year will be stronger than the second half adds. That said, we really feel great about our trajectory. Christine, do you want to take it from there?\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. And I would just add one thing on the Disney+ core markets. In this third quarter, when you exclude Disney+ Hotstar, we saw solid sub growth quarter-over-quarter net adds consistent with what we saw in the previous quarter. So, we feel really good about the continued growth in our core markets. And on Hotstar, at Investor Day, we said that we anticipated Hotstar to be between 30% and 40% of total Disney+, and we\u2019re not updating that guidance at this point.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks for the question. And I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.80, an increase of $0.72 from the prior year quarter. I'll walk through our results today by segment, starting with Parks, Experiences and Products where we continued to benefit from improvements and recovery at our parks and resorts as well as at consumer products. Segment operating income at DPEP in Q3 increased by $2.2 billion year-over-year. At parks and experiences, we continued to benefit in the third quarter from the reopening of our sites around the world. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for the entire third quarter. Whereas in the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World was closed for the entire quarter, and Shanghai Disney was open for 48 days. Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris were open for 72 days and 19 days, respectively, in the third quarter versus 10 days and zero days in the prior year quarter. And Disneyland Resort was opened for 65 days during the third quarter and was closed for all of the prior year quarter. At Walt Disney World, third quarter attendance levels were generally at or near our daily capacity levels, which increased throughout the quarter. Disneyland Resort also steadily increased attendance and capacity following its reopening at the end of April and particularly after the lifting of California state restrictions on June 15th. Guest spending at our domestic parks has been exceptionally strong, with third quarter per cap up significantly versus fiscal 2019 at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. Guest spend has benefited from pent-up demand and favorable guest mix, driving higher admissions per cap as well as from spending on products related to Star Wars, Galaxy's Edge and Avengers Campus. Looking forward, theme park reservations at both of our domestic parks remain strong, and we continue to utilize our yield management strategy to deliver the optimal guest experience and provide flexibility to our guests during these dynamic times, all while driving economic margin for our shareholders. At consumer products, improved results year-over-year were driven by growth at both our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. Growth in merchandise licensing was primarily due to higher revenue from merchandise, based on several of our key franchises, including Mickey and Minnie, Star Wars, including the Mandalorian, Disney Princess and Spider-Man. The increase in retail was due to higher results at Disney stores, most of which were closed in the prior year quarter as well as a comparison to the impairment of store assets in the prior year quarter. Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. Third quarter operating income decreased by about $1 billion versus the prior year as improved results at direct-to-consumer were offset by declines at Linear Networks and Content Sales/Licensing and Other. At Linear Networks, operating results were lower at both, our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in operating income at cable was due to higher programming and production costs and higher marketing costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. As we called out last quarter, the increase in Q3 programming and production costs was due to the return of live sports at ESPN, driven by the NBA and Major League Baseball. In the prior year quarter, a significant number of live sporting events were canceled or delayed due to COVID-19. At broadcasting, lower results from the ABC television network were only partially offset by growth at our owned television stations. The decrease at ABC was largely due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. The increase in programming and production costs was due to an increase in the average cost of programming and the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in the third quarter compared to the second quarter in the prior fiscal year. Domestic advertising revenue increased year-over-year at both, cable and broadcasting, driven by favorable comparisons versus the prior year due to COVID-19. At cable, the increase was driven by ESPN, where third quarter advertising revenue increased by $400 million versus the prior year, reflecting the return of live sporting events. Q4-to-date, domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above prior year. But bear in mind that this comparison is complicated by various COVID and timing impacts from the prior year. We're not going to provide a forecast for the quarter, but the underlying sports ad marketplace remains strong for us, particularly in the quarter in which the Olympics were held. At broadcasting, higher advertising results were primarily driven by increased rates and the timing of the Academy Awards, which benefited both, the owned television stations and ABC. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 4% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Results at international channels declined due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising revenue. Both of these factors were impacted by the return of live sporting events and in particular, the Indian Premier League, which held cricket matches from April 9th until the season was postponed on May 4th versus no matches in the prior year quarter due to COVID-19. Turning to Direct-to-Consumer. Q3 operating income improved by over $300 million versus the prior year, driven by Hulu, partially offset by a higher loss at Disney+. The increase at Hulu was due to growth in subscription and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming costs related to Hulu Live. Hulu ended the third quarter with 42.8 million paid subscribers, up from 41.6 million in Q2, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live decreased slightly to 3.7 million from 3.8 million at the end of Q2. At Disney+, operating results decreased versus the prior year due to higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs, driven by the ongoing expansion of the service. These higher costs were partially offset by increased subscription revenue, reflecting subscriber growth and increases in retail pricing as well as Premier Access revenue for Cruella. Note that Disney+ Premier Access revenue is included in our DTC operating results but is excluded for the purposes of calculating ARPU. As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the third quarter with 116 million global paid subscribers to Disney+, up from approximately $104 million in the second quarter. Disney+ Hotstar accounted for the majority of our net subscriber additions between Q2 and Q3, making up a little less than 40% of our total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the third quarter. However, subscriber growth was also solid at our core Disney+ markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, with total quarter-over-quarter net adds in those markets consistent with net adds from Q2. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.16. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.12 or an increase of about $0.50 versus the second quarter, reflecting a benefit from the recent price increases, both domestically and abroad. Disney+ Hotstar ARPU also increased from Q2 to Q3 due to higher ad revenue per subscriber, reflecting the roughly four weeks of IPL matches that were played in Q3 versus none in Q2. At ESPN+, operating results in the quarter were comparable versus the prior year. ESPN+ ended Q3 with 14.9 million paid subscribers, reflecting over 1 million net subscriber additions versus the second quarter. Content Sales/Licensing and Other operating income at DMED decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year due to lower home entertainment and theatrical distribution results. The decrease in home entertainment results was due to lower unit sales of new release titles, reflecting the performance of Raya and the Last Dragon and Soul in the third quarter compared to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Frozen II, Onward, Call of the Wild, and Ford v. Ferrari in the prior year quarter, along with lower catalog sales. The decrease in theatrical distribution results was primarily due to higher marketing expense for future releases and lower operating income from titles in release. Looking ahead, there are a handful of items I would like to mention, as you think about our fourth quarter. At Linear Networks, we expect fourth quarter operating income to decline versus the prior year, reflecting incremental marketing and programming costs at ABC and FX, in addition to an adverse comparison to last year's benefit from the 53rd week. The increase in marketing and programming expenses at ABC and FX is driven by more than twofold increase in the number of series premieres versus the prior year quarter as productions in the prior year were impacted by COVID. As it relates to the 53rd week, recall that last year, we estimated a benefit of approximately $200 million to the Company, which primarily impacted our Linear Networks. At Content Sales/Licensing and Other, we are expecting an operating loss in the fourth quarter, driven by a number of items, including higher marketing and distribution costs in the theatrical window due to more titles being released versus the prior year, in addition to lower results from home entertainment and third-party content licensing. We now expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to be approximately $200 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by increased spending for facilities across the enterprise and technology for our DTC services. And finally, in light of the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our continued prioritization of investments that support our growth initiatives, the Board decided not to declare or pay a dividend for the first half of fiscal 2021. Longer term, we do anticipate that both, dividends and share repurchases will remain a part of our capital allocation strategy. However, for the time being, we don't anticipate declaring a dividend or repurchasing shares until we return to a more normalized operating environment and our leverage is back to levels more consistent with a single A credit rating. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions. I'll take your question on Hulu, Michael. You're absolutely correct. Hulu exceeded our expectations, and it was profitable this quarter. There's a couple of things going on here. One is, it has had -- continued to have subscriber growth and also very strong advertising revenue. The advertising is coming from higher sell-through rates, a lot of addressable advertising and a significant ramp-up in the dynamic ad insertion technology that we have within Hulu Live. So, those are things that are driving it. And at the same time, they are just like all of our other streaming services, they're ramping up their production, programming and also marketing expense to promote those new shows. So, we're very pleased with what's going on at Hulu, but we're not going to update our guidance yet because we are in the process of doing our fiscal \u201822 annual operating plan. And if we feel that we have to update it after we complete that, we will certainly do it. Hi Alexia. And I'd add to that a couple of things. One is, we have seen very, very strong per caps in addition to all the yield management things Bob mentioned. But the per caps, in my comments, I referred to them as exceptionally strong. And I would not use that word were it not for the fact that they were exceptional. Last quarter, I said that they were up strong double-digit and this quarter was even stronger. If you look at - when a park is closed for a long period of time, as Disneyland was, as Paris was, when they reopen, the per caps really shoot up. And we still have, even though Walt Disney World isn't open now for over a year, we're still seeing extremely strong per cap growth continue at that park. So, in addition to all the technology things that we're implementing, as Bob mentioned, reservation systems, the dining apps, we're just seeing the consumer behavior be very favorable. And the guest experience is something that we're going to be focused on, especially as we continue to reopen. Okay. Ben, I'll try to go through your -- hope I can remember them all. So, Hulu. Hulu did have very strong advertising growth in the quarter, and we continue to see that growth quarter after quarter. We haven't specifically quantified it, but I would say that it is driven by higher impressions as well as rates. And as I mentioned, the ability for us to use the dynamic ad insertion in Hulu Live is also a benefit. I think, the advertising sales team, if they had more inventory, they could certainly sell it. There's that much demand for it. Just to put some context around it, because I think it's a precursor of what the upfront showed is that the -- we came out of a very strong upfront but we had about 40% of the total upfront dollars into streaming and digital. And a lot of that is not only across Hulu, but also across our other entertainment and sports platforms. So, I think that just shows that the kind of advertising that's going through Hulu is certainly a growth driver. The IPL is coming back. It's scheduled to come back on September 19, and it will run through, I believe, the last final match is scheduled for mid-October, around October 15. When you think about Disney+ Hotstar, IPL is certainly a very, very important component of the offerings, but it's only one because we also have a very broad portfolio of general entertainment as well as other sports. It has a lot of original content, library content in it from all of the Disney+ brands and IP. And we added over 18,000 of original local programming every year. So, we feel really good about not only the IPL but also Star -- Hotstar+. In LatAm, we will be -- LatAm, the launch for LatAm is in later this quarter. But I don't have any updates to anything new on the sports side. Yes. I would just add that our parks -- our plan -- and once again, this is -- we'll monitor the trends with what's going on with the Delta variant. But, we're expecting to have our parks domestically be fully staffed up by the end of this calendar year, calendar 2021. And we're going to be increasing capacities as we have the demand, and we're also being able to train -- thoroughly train our employees as they come back in. And once again, this is an ever-changing landscape with COVID, but we're going to be particularly careful, and we're also going to bring our capacity online aggressively, but measured. We're not just going to open up the doors and flung them open. So, we're doing this in a measured fashion for the health and safety of not only our guests, but also our cast members in the parks. Yes. Jessica, we fully agree with your assessment of the market and the high degree of affinity that the Japanese market has for Disney IP. So, we're totally agreeing. We did, as Bob say, a soft launch with a partner last year, but it was only to a small part of the market, and we're really excited to do the full launch that will be in this coming October for Disney+. And we'll see how that goes, but we have been very cautiously optimistic as we always are, but we believe that that IP is going to resonate. We don't, as you know, break out ARPU by individual markets. So, we'll just be giving you the Disney+ ARPUs the way we currently are doing it. Sure. And I would just add one thing on the Disney+ core markets. In this third quarter, when you exclude Disney+ Hotstar, we saw solid sub growth quarter-over-quarter net adds consistent with what we saw in the previous quarter. So, we feel really good about the continued growth in our core markets. And on Hotstar, at Investor Day, we said that we anticipated Hotstar to be between 30% and 40% of total Disney+, and we're not updating that guidance at this point."

            "name": "Bob Chapek",
            "content": "Thanks, Lowell, and hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to start off by talking about our Company's priorities for the future. As has been the case for Disney's nearly 100-year history, it all begins with great storytelling, which is the foundation of our special connection to audiences and guests. And our foremost priority will continue to be to tell the world's most original and enduring stories brought to life by the world's most talented creators. As home to some of the most beloved franchises, we will maximize the synergy of our unique ecosystem to further deepen consumers' connection to our characters and stories. And we will use the power of our far-reaching platforms and emerging technologies to better anticipate what our consumers want and deliver them a more seamless and more personalized entertainment experience. We are executing against these priorities, and results clearly speak for themselves. Looking across the Company over the past quarter, we are pleased with the trajectory we are on as we continue to grow our businesses, despite the challenges presented by the ongoing everchanging COVID-19 pandemic. We ended the third fiscal quarter in a strong position, with adjusted EPS up tenfold to $0.80 compared to $0.08 last year. At our Parks, Experiences and Products business, we're encouraged by some of the positive trends we're seeing, and new developments we have been hard at work on, including the brand-new Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure, where guests can team up with their favorite superheroes in thrilling ways. At our international parks, Shanghai is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year with great fanfare, and we welcome the first guests to our reimagined Marvel themed hotel at Disneyland Paris. Meanwhile, work continues on a wide array of new experiences, including the one-of-a-kind Star Wars themed Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World. And as part of a multiyear transformation of EPCOT, we'll soon introduce our extraordinary new nighttime spectacular Harmonious. Last month, we completed our first cruise since the start of the pandemic with the Disney Magic, which is currently sailing short-term staycations for UK residents. And the Disney Dream set sail on its first U.S.-based cruise this week. Future bookings for all of our ships remain strong, with bookings in the third quarter in particular, having benefited from the announcement of our fall 2022 itineraries and the successful marketing launch of our fifth ship, the Disney Wish, which will set sail in summer of 2022. As our parks business continues its recovery and we see demand grow, we are now putting into action some of the amazing guest-centric services that we have been developing over the last few years. These include Magic Key, our recently announced new annual pass membership program at Disneyland. It provides great value and a variety of options for our guests, and will be available starting on August 25th. The reaction to the news from fans has been extremely positive. Additionally, we've made significant investments in sophisticated technology and tools, creating a revolutionary new multi-tiered service, we're calling Disney Genie, that will enable our guests to more easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer. We're very, very excited about this new service, and we'll be providing additional detail soon. The goal of Disney Genie, which will appear in a user-friendly app, is to create a better, more personalized and customized experience for guests, putting them in control and providing even greater flexibility and choice. They'll be able to spend less time waiting in line and figuring out what attractions or dining options are available, and more time having fun. On the direct-to-consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the continuing success of our portfolio of streaming services. Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu have performed incredibly well with 116 million 14.9 million and 42.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of nearly 174 million subscriptions. Numerous breakout hits from our beloved brands, including Pixar's Luca and Marvel's Loki and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier have contributed to strong engagement and new subscriber growth in core Disney+ markets. And we have continued to launch Disney+ in new markets around the world, including Disney+ Hotstar in Malaysia and Thailand in Q3. Disney+ is also currently available in a limited capacity in Japan and will expand to the full market in late October, followed by additional APAC markets, including South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in mid-November. The launch of Disney+ in Eastern Europe has moved from late 2021 to summer of 2022, primarily to allow for an expanded footprint that will include parts of the Middle East and South Africa. Additionally, we're excited about the launch of Star+ throughout Latin America later this month. As we've said, our direct-to-consumer business is the Company's top priority. And among our unique advantages in promoting and growing our DTC service are our powerhouse brands and the vast array of direct consumer touch points we have across our businesses, from our media networks to our theme parks to our consumer products. This synergy enables us to raise consumer awareness and further increase engagement with our streaming services. And the power of this synergy will be on full display on November 12 when we celebrate Disney+ Day with an unprecedented Company-wide cross-promotional campaign. Our robust pipeline of content continues to fuel growth, and we have an incredible lineup of new programming for Disney+. On Thanksgiving Day, we are thrilled to be premiering the first of Peter Jackson's highly anticipated six-episode Beatles documentary, Get Back. We also have exciting new series from Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic coming later this year, including Marvel's Hawkeye, starring Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld; The Mandalorian Spin-Off, The Book of Boba Fett and National Geographic's, Welcome to Earth with Will Smith. With respect to our current approach to distributing our feature-length films, last year, in light of the prolonged and unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we needed to find alternative ways to bring our movies to consumers while theaters were closed. And once they began to reopen, there was still widespread reluctance to return. Therefore, we adopted a three-pronged strategy for releasing our films that consisted of theatrical releases, direct to Disney+ and a hybrid of theatrical plus premier access as we did with Cruella, Jungle Cruise and Marvel's Black Widow, the top-performing film at the domestic box office since the start of the pandemic. Both, Bob Iger and I, along with the leaders of our creative and distribution teams, determined this was the right strategy because it would enable us to reach the broadest possible audience. And just to reiterate, distribution decisions are made on a phone by phone basis based on global marketplace conditions and consumer behavior. We will continue to utilize all available options going forward, learn from insights gained with each release and innovate accordingly, while always doing what we believe is in the best interest of the film and the best interest of our constituents. We have an incredible slate of upcoming theatrical films, starting with Free Guy which premiers tomorrow, followed by Marvel's newest action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings on September 3rd. The highly anticipated live-action musical, West Side Story from Steven Spielberg, is set for December as is the Kingsman, a prequel in the popular Kingsman series. We have Disney Animation Studios' Encanto, an incredibly heartwarming story set into magical town in Colombia and featuring music by the incomparable Lin-Manuel Miranda. Our Marvel slate includes four feature films in fiscal 2022, the all-new Eternals, alongside sequels to Doctor Strange, Thor and Black Panther. A brand new Indiana Jones Adventure starring Harrison Ford, is due in the summer, as is the origin story of another Intrepid Explorer in Lightyear, a spin-off of the beloved Toy Story franchise. It's a widely appealing slate with something for everybody. Our goal is always to provide guests and consumers with unparalleled entertainment, whether they're visiting one of our parks or watching one of our films in a theater or on our streaming platforms. And as we continue our recovery, we believe we are taking the right steps to further this goal while growing our businesses and increasing shareholder value. Personally, I am as optimistic as ever about the future of our Company. We have a robust and growing portfolio of DTC services powered by the world's best storytellers and greatest brands and franchises, and the parks business, which extend those stories and creates a place where magic comes to life in a more guest-friendly way than ever. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine and she'll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the way ahead. Michael, as you probably recognize, we live in a very uncertain world in terms of the recovery of some of our markets in the theatrical exhibition world. It's certainly part of that. We've said from the very beginning that we value flexibility in being able to make as last-minute calls as we can, given what we see in the marketplace. And certainly, when we planned our schedule that we're executing right now, we did not anticipate, nor did I think anybody, the resurgence of COVID with the Delta variant that would have such a significant impact on the marketplace. At the same time, when you work in an ecosystem, having a lot of partners, they need to be able to plan their business, too. And so, at some point, we have to put a stake in the ground and say, for example, Shang-Chi, that's going to be a title that we're going to put in the marketplace or Free Guy, that's going to be a title that we're going to put into the marketplace. Not knowing, again, three months earlier when you make that commitment, what exactly the marketplace is going to look like. But, what I do think that says, Michael, it says that we value flexibility and we value to follow where the consumer is going to go. And while some of that's uncertain, I think, in terms of relative to where the rest of the market is, you see that we've got more flexibility in terms of how we program. And nothing is in stone because the marketplace is rapidly changing. But at some point, you've got to put a stake in the ground and say, this is what we're going to do. And that's where we ended up on Shang-Chi and Free Guy, which are our next two titles out. Okay. Good questions. On Free Guy, obviously, this is a title that we acquired under a different distribution assumption and set of agreements. So, we don't have the degree of freedom to do that on Free Guy. On Shang-Chi, we think it's actually going to be an interesting experiment for us because it's got only a 45-day window for us. So, the prospect of being able to take a Marvel title to the service after going theatrical with 45 days will be yet another data point to inform our actions going forward on our titles. But once again, I'll refer back to my previous answer. When we planned Shang-Chi, that title was planned on being in a much more healthy theatrical environment. And at this point, unfortunately, due to distribution agreements that we have and due to just the practicalities of last-minute changes, it wouldn't be possible. Okay. In terms of impact of the Delta variant, we see strong demand for our parks continuing. And the primary noise that we're seeing right now are really around group or convention cancellations. In other words, large groups that are coming in relatively short-term. But on the whole, we see really strong demand for our parks. In fact, our park reservations now are above our Q3 attendance levels. And as you just saw with our earnings announcement, our Q3 attendance levels were pretty darn good. So, we're still bullish about our park business going forward. I may also suggest, as a bridge to the second question that we've implemented a reservation system that's going to enable us to spread our demand, increase our yield and improve our guest experience at the same time. And in terms of the long-lasting impacts that you mentioned, I think some of the cost implications that we need to do for hygienic purposes are going to be relatively short-lived. And frankly, in the grand scheme of operating our parks, not all that material. But what will be the long-lasting impact is the improvements that we're making with guest personalization and guest choice, therefore, affecting the tremendous yield benefits that we've been able to extract over the last few quarters. And that's only going to grow in the future with our ability to really do world-class yield management systems through our new reservation system. Okay. Ben, you used the correct word, transformational. MyMagic+ was us basically sticking our toe in the pond of this type of transformational work. Disney Genie though is that program on steroids. This is going to revolutionize our guest experience. Guests are going to spend less time waiting and more time having fun in our parks with a dramatically improved guest experience. That's going to make their navigation of their day and their planning of their day much easier. Essentially, what it's going to do is take the consumer preferences that we know from our consumers, given what we know from them, and blend that with basically industrial engineering data that we've got in terms of how our park is operating that day and meld those together to make suggestions on the fly that not only will lead to that improved guest experience, but at the same time lead to substantial commercial opportunities as the guest navigates their base. So, it certainly qualifies in my mind for both materiality and transformational impact on our business from a yield standpoint. Okay. In terms of the health of Disney+, we feel really great about our sub trajectory. We've got world-class content from the world's best storytellers, plus our international launches, plus the power of the Disney bundle. And you asked the question about churn. We're really pleased with churn. We've taken some price increases over the past few quarters. And what you're seeing is that our churn has declined, including in Latin America where we went up -- I mean by -- in Europe, sorry, by \u20ac2 when we added Star brand as a sixth brand tile. So, our retention is very healthy across the globe. We're really, really pleased with that. And I think, again, it really goes back to the price value that we're offering our guests. When you take out Luca, Loki, Falcon and the Winter Soldier. There's something essentially new each week. You blend that together with a tremendous local investment that we're making in our international territories. And it's really a price value proposition that is really great. So, the fact that our churn is so low, our engagement is so high, our retention is so high amongst the local corridors where we're taking price increases, I think, says everything about it. In terms of -- and I'll start this off, Christine, on the cost side and what we expect to see in terms of our parks profitability. But right now, you can use a lot of different metrics to look at our business. In California, we've got all three of our hotels open, for example. We've got 70% of our available rooms open in Walt Disney World. So, you can see that we're not quite 100% available at this point. But, I think that a lot of the costs from here on out are variable. Obviously, as we scale our business and we get up closer and closer to 100% capacity, our efficiencies and operating become much, much higher. So, I think you'll see disproportionate benefit as we go from here on. Christine, I don't know if you want to elaborate. Okay. Obviously, this world has been disrupted by COVID, and we're all reacting to a very fluid situation in terms of the marketplace. We're very grateful for the fact that we had the ability to take out a lot of titles, both not only in the theatrical marketplace for those that prefer to watch a film that way, but also at the same time through our Disney Premier Access, and that was a winning strategy for us to give consumers the choice for those that decided that going back to a theater was not for them at the same time. That said, these films, Jessica, were really conceived under a time when we did not know what was going to be happening with consumer behavior three, four years later and certainly didn't know about COVID at the time. So, we're dealing under a different sort of set of conditions than we thought. What I will say is that just like we've done many times before, as the business has evolved and transformed, we've figured out ways to fairly compensate our talent, so that no matter what the business model is that we have to go to market with, everybody feels satisfied. And I will say that since COVID has begun, we've entered into hundreds of talented arrangements with our talent. And by and large, they've gone very, very smoothly. So, we expect that, that would be the case going forward. Certainly, this is a time of anxiety the marketplace as a lot has changed recently. And again, these films that we're releasing right now were imagined under a completely different environment than unfortunately, the fate has delivered us. But, we're trying to do the best thing for all our constituents and make sure that everybody who's in the value chain, if you will, feels like they're having their contractual commitments honored, both from a distribution and a compensation standpoint. What I'll say before I turn it over to Christine on Japan is that remember that heretofore, as we've launched Disney+ around the world, in Japan, we've done it with a fairly limited distribution system and that's about the change going forward. But at the same time, that market is under, as they call it, a state of emergency. And that certainly has disrupted that marketplace as we go from a fairly limited distribution now to a much more broad distribution. Christine? Jason, I'd like to think of it like we're in the first inning of the first game of a very long season. We've not even been at this right now as Disney, at least for two full years. Despite that two full years, as you suggested, we've gone into 61 countries in 21 months. So, we're very proud of that and we're proud of the success that we've had. I would caution not to come to any conclusions about the size of the market. We've got a TAM of 1.1 billion households across the globe. And we've only just begun our journey. And as I think you see, what's really going to make the difference for Disney is our spectacular content told by the best storytellers against our powerhouse franchises. You put that in the context of also all the local investments that we're making. And I think we're going to have a bright future ahead. And I understand the benchmark that you're using, but I think this is a different marketplace. And I think we're charging forward to maximize the opportunity, given our unique combinations of not only distribution platforms, but intellectual property and storytelling. Okay. In terms of the bundle, you see that the majority are not -- maybe not the majority, but a good chunk of our marketing now is going towards a bundle. And that's because the -- while we enjoy extremely low churn rates on our individual services, the churn rates on the bundle are even lower, surprisingly low even for us. And I think what that says is that our customers enjoy the price value of the bundle that we offer and getting an incredible amount of content for a really good price. While I can't comment on some of the specific percentages that you're probably looking for, but I will make a comment on sort of going forward. You noticed that across the world, we've got different business models. We've got different business models for two reasons. Number one, the unique situation that we find ourselves in each market whether it's Europe or LatAm or Asia or North America tend to be different in terms of what rights we have and what the consumers are actually looking for. But that also gives us an opportunity to test out different propositions. Obviously, the proposition that we have in Europe with Star as a 6-brand title looks significantly different than our relatively unbundled approach that we have in North America. Again, we're in the first inning of the first game of all the long season, and we're taking all this into account. There may also be certain constraints that were under that could, at least from a short-term standpoint, limit our ability do what long-term we might feel was ideal. But frankly, we don't know what's ideal yet. I will say that we're extremely pleased in every market that we've launched our direct-to-consumer services. We've exceeded our expectations in every marketplace. So, in terms of the way that we've approached the market so far, it's worked really, really well. Is there an opportunity for improvement by considering something different going forward? Possibly. But, we're going to continue to learn. And as we learn, I'm sure we'll refine our offerings in the marketplace, as time goes on. Okay. Disney+ Day will be a balanced approach between global and local product. We're going to have a real exciting lineup, as you might guess, as we approach those consumers who have not yet signed up for Disney+ with a really attractive group of titles to be announced. But, I think it gives us an opportunity to provide a focal point for consumers that have not yet tripped over to Disney+. And I think it's going to give us a focal point of excitement and energy that will not only pay benefits in the U.S., but globally as well. In terms of the net add question and how that's going to improve, first half versus second half, again, we feel really great about our sub trajectory. As we learn, though, we're finding out there's tremendous seasonality in this business that we may not have known about before we really got into it, or at least in terms of above expectations. Also, I want to caveat that our sub adds aren't necessarily going to be linear. I think a lot of the marketplace expects these things to sort of be a straight-line math, and it's not really turning out that way. And as we've indicated before, we do believe our first half adds this fiscal year will be stronger than the second half adds. That said, we really feel great about our trajectory. Christine, do you want to take it from there?"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2021 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a transcript will be available on our website. We are once again hosting today\u2019s call remotely. So joining me remotely are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll be happy to your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, and we well get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS of 32% to $0.79, compared to $0.60 last year. And since then, we've continued to make progress across our businesses as we remain laser-focused on our ongoing recovery, while also fueling long-term growth. Our strategic focus continues in three key areas. First is direct-to-consumer. We successfully launched our streaming offerings, Disney+ and Star, in a number of markets internationally. And we've been pleased with the growth and engagement in those markets to date. Our steady cadence of new high-quality branded content, along with our robust collection of library titles, allows us to continually attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. At the same time, we are also closely monitoring the recovery of theatrical exhibition, as consumers begin to return to theatres, and I'll talk more about the specifics later. Finally, we are focused on the ongoing recovery of our parks business and the resumption of Disney Cruise Line. There have been some encouraging developments in recent months, particularly with the ongoing rollout of the vaccine and the gradual lifting of government mandated restrictions. And through this time, we've taken advantage of the opportunity to make improvements to our operating procedures to enhance the guest experience through the use of technology innovations, new ticketing strategies, and other offerings. We are especially excited that after being closed for 412 days, we welcomed our first guests back to Disneyland two weeks ago and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Bob and I stood on Main Street USA on opening day, and it was so wonderful to see the joy on our cast and guests' faces and feel the excitement in the air. It's been fantastic to see cast members back at work. Most recently at Disneyland, we were able to quickly recall more than 10,000 furloughed cast and retrain them to be able to operate to the State of California's new health and safety requirements. We continue to see strong growing demand from consumers as we are at or near our reduced capacity levels at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland for the current quarter. It's clear our guests are excited to get back to experiencing the magic of Disney and they also have extraordinary confidence in our safety protocols. At Shanghai Disney Resort, where they just kicked off their year-long 5th anniversary celebration, the park is operating at or above FY 2019 levels. We're also encouraged by what we're seeing at Hong Kong Disneyland, and we are hopeful we will be able to announce a reopening date for Disneyland Paris soon. Despite the pandemic, we continue to make progress on a number of highly anticipated projects at our parks around the world, including the all new Avengers Campus, which is set to open at Disney California Adventure on June 4. I had a chance to visit recently and the attractions and multiple state-of-the-art experiences are truly phenomenal. We recently unveiled our newest cruise ship, the Disney Wish to the public with a virtual live stream presentation that has been viewed nearly 1.2 million times. The ship is amazing and it includes the AquaMouse water ride, the first ever Disney attraction at sea. The Disney Wish will set sail on its maiden voyage in 2022 and bookings open to the general public on May 27. On the studio side, we are pleased to be nearing full production levels, and we are also significantly ramping up content creation at our studios consistent with the guidance we provided at Investor Day. An example of this is 20th Century and Searchlight Pictures, where they are gradually increasing output and will reach a steady state of 15 and 20 films, respectively, to fuel our general entertainment offerings across all of our distribution platforms. We're incredibly proud that Searchlight's Nomadland took home Oscars for best actress, best director, with Chlo\u00e9 Zhao becoming the first woman of color to win the award and best picture. That's five best picture wins since 2009 and 43 Academy Awards in total. Additionally, Pixar's stellar record of award-winning films continues with the Studio's animated masterpiece, Soul, which took home Oscars for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score. And I'm happy to say that now millions are able to enjoy Soul on Disney+ and Nomadland on Hulu. As we have consistently stated, flexibility is a key component of our distribution strategy. And we have outlined three approaches for distributing our films. Releases in theatres with a simultaneous offering via Disney+ Premier Access releases straight to Disney+ and traditional exclusive theatrical releases. Here's how this translates to our tremendous upcoming film slate. Cruella will be released in theatres and via Disney+ Premier Access on May 28, followed by Pixar's Luca, which will be released exclusively at Disney+ on June 18. The highly anticipated Black Widow will be in theatres and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 9, and Disney's Jungle Cruise, hilarious adventure filled expedition, will be available in theatres and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 30. I'm pleased to announce today that amidst recent signs of increased consumer confidence in movie going; two films, 20th Century's exciting comedy, Free Guy; and Marvel's action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, will be released with a 45-day exclusive theatrical window on August 13 and September 3, respectively. And of course, regardless of where they originate, all of our films and episodic series will end up as part of the robust library of content on our DTC platforms. Like our films, our Disney+ original series have become must-watch events. Starting with the success of The Mandalorian followed by Marvel's WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. These not only became immediate hits, but part of the cultural zeitgeist. And the anticipation for Marvel's newest series, Loki, which debuts on June 9 has been through the roof. The second season of High School Musical, The Musical, The Series, the all new The Mysterious Benedict Society based on the popular young adult book series, and the animated series Monsters at Work are also coming to Disney+ in the next couple of months, just to name a few. We are uniquely positioned with the most compelling brands and franchises in entertainment. And we continue to deliver the high-quality, one-of-a-kind content that consumers want. That's clearly reflected in the success of Disney+, which amassed nearly 104 million paid subscribers as of the end of the second fiscal quarter. We are on track to achieve our guidance of 230 million to 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. Looking at our entire portfolio streaming services, we expect that as full production levels resumed and we get to a more normalized cycle, the increased output will help fuel additional sub growth across Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Hotstar. Hulu and ESPN+ had 41.6 million and 13.8 million paid subscribers, respectively, at the end of the quarter. On Hulu, buzz-worthy content continues to boost performance, including the award-winning Hulu original film, the United States vs. Billie Holiday, and Season 4 of The Handmaid's Tale, which premiered to the biggest audience ever for a Hulu original. And there's lots more coming to Hulu, including Marvel's new animated series, M.O.D.O.K.; Season 2 of the hit series, Love, Victor; and Season 10 of the wildly popular anthology, American Horror Story on FX on Hulu. In March, we launched ESPN+ on Hulu and we are very pleased with its early progress. Viewers who subscribe to both Hulu and ESPN+, are able to watch and engage with the great content that's available on ESPN+ without leaving the Hulu environment. ESPN+ programming includes thousands of live sporting events, original shows, series and documentaries with the UFC lightweight Championship by airing live on ESPN+ pay-per-view on May 15. The final match of the FA Cup also on May 15, followed by the PGA Championship, Wimbledon, and the highly anticipated third UFC matchup between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor on pay-per-view, July 10. Not to mention the incredible additions to our lineup, including NHL and more college football in the fall. Live sports are a very important component of our content business. And even admits the challenges of the past year, we have continued to build our unrivalled portfolio of sports rights in a disciplined way. While our overall strategy is still very supportive of our linear business, given the important economic value address for the company, we're also building out our ESPN+ direct-to-consumer offering and with every deal we make, we are considering both the linear and DTC components. With this strategy in mind, we've reached a number of long-term accretive deals that each play a very specific role as part of our sports portfolio. Some are weighted more towards linear with a significant digital component, such as the NFL and SEC deals, others reflecting an emphasis on direct-to-consumer. These include agreements with the UFC, the PGA Tour, Bundesliga, and the NHL. For example, as part of a 7-year rights deal with the NHL, 75 of the leagues live National Games will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ will be the sole home for more than 1,000 out of market NHL games, further submitting the service as a must have for hockey fans. And today, I'm excited to announce two additional sports rights deals. We've reached a renewal deal through 2028 with Major League Baseball with 30 exclusive regular season games, which include 25 Sunday night baseball games, and opening night annually. Coverage of the highly anticipated potential expanded Wild Card Series and the option to simulcast all live MLB coverage from ESPN networks on ESPN+. We've also signed a historic rights agreement with the top division in Spanish club football, La Liga. La Liga is one of the world's best and most popular soccer leagues, including a number of the top clubs in the world, and one of the best players in the world, Lionel Messi. And this 8-year deal, covering both English and Spanish language rights, brings 380 La Liga matches and a host of La Liga two matches per season to ESPN+, beginning in August. And this deal bolsters ESPN+'s position as a top destination for soccer in the U.S., offering fans more than 2,900 matches per season. When you combine the unparalleled assets of the Walt Disney Company, ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, plus our highly engaging digital and social content, it's clear that Disney is the absolute leader when it comes to serving our sports fans in the most effective way possible. We believe in the power of live sports, and are confident our multi-platform rights deals we've made will provide us tremendous value now and into the future. Overall, we are pleased with the encouraging signs of recovery across our businesses, and we are confident we continue to move in the right direction for our future growth. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Christine and she'll talk more in depth about our results for the quarter.\nChristine McCarthy: Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter increased 32% versus the prior year to $0.79 per share. We are beginning to see progress in many of our businesses after more than a year of adverse impacts from the pandemic. While we are not out of the woods yet, we are pleased with our results this quarter at both our DMED and DPEP businesses. I will walk through our results by segments, starting with Media and Entertainment Distribution. Operating income at the segment increased by 74% in the second quarter versus the prior year, due to higher results across all of the segments lines of business. At Linear Networks, the increase was driven by growth at both our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income increased versus the prior year. Higher results at cable were driven by lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue partially offset by lower advertising revenue. ESPN's results were in line with the guidance we gave last quarter, and ESPN was the most significant contributor to cables growth this quarter. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. As we mentioned last quarter, fiscal Q2 included only one CFP Bowl game, the National Championship compared to four in the prior year quarter, three CFP Bowl games and the national championship game. Cable programming and production costs also benefited in the quarter from lower production costs for other live sporting events and lower programming costs at Freeform. Lower advertising revenue at cable was primarily due to lower average viewership. At ESPN, domestic advertising revenue decreased significantly in the quarter driven by lower ratings for key programming, in addition to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. Quarter to date, domestic advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing up significantly versus last year, benefiting from the prior year's lack of significant live sports programming due to COVID. At broadcasting, higher results were driven by growth at ABC, partially offset by a decrease at the owned television stations. At ABC, lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Programming and production costs were impacted by the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which took place in the third quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. Lower advertising revenue was primarily driven by lower average viewership and the timing of the Academy Awards partially offset by higher rates. On our Q1 earnings call, we said we expected the Academy Awards timing shift and lower political advertising at our own stations would negatively impact broadcasting results in the second quarter versus the prior year. While we did see those specific adverse impacts play out, overall broadcasting results were higher than we expected, driven by lower marketing spend due to timing shifts of some new series, in addition to a number of other smaller factors. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 5% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating results at international channels increased due to a decrease in programming and production costs and an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. Lower programming and production costs in the second quarter were driven by a higher percentage of content cost being allocated to our DTC business rather than our networks business as we continue the international expansion of Disney+ and Star, in addition to channel closures over the past year. Advertising revenue increased primarily due to the timing of BCCI cricket matches, which generally take place in the first quarter, but were in the second quarter this year due to COVID related timing shifts. Lower affiliate revenue at our international channels was due to channel closures as well as an unfavorable foreign currency impact. At our direct-to-consumer businesses, operating results in the quarter improved by over $500 million versus the prior year due to stronger results at Hulu, and ESPN+. The increase at Hulu was due to subscriber revenue growth and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs related to the Hulu Live TV service. Hulu ended the second quarter with 41.6 million paid subscribers, up from 39.4 million in Q1, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live declined modestly to 3.8 million from 4 million at the end of Q1, which we attribute primarily to the $10 price increase we took in December, in addition to a modest impact from seasonality. At ESPN+, improved year over year results were driven by subscriber growth and an increase from UFC pay-per-view events. ESPN+ had 13.8 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter. At Disney+, results were comparable to the prior year quarter, as an increase in subscribers was largely offset by higher content, marketing and technology costs. As Bob mentioned earlier, we had almost 104 million Disney+ paid subscribers at the end of the second quarter. At our Annual Meeting, we announced we have reached 100 million global paid subscribers. We reached that milestone in early March. So we added subs at a faster pace in the last month of the second quarter than we did in the first 2 months. And that was despite no major market launches, a price increase in EMEA and a domestic price increase towards the end of the quarter. We attribute this success to the strength of our overall content slate. The launch of the Star general entertainment offering in many markets and the continued growth of Disney+ Hotstar. Between Q1 and Q2, Disney+ Hotstar was the strongest contributor to net subscriber additions, making up approximately a third of the total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the second quarter. However, ARPU at Disney+ Hotstar was down significantly versus the first quarter due to lower advertising revenue as a result of the timing of IPL cricket matches and the impact of COVID in India. As a reminder, the majority of the prior IPL tournament took place in fiscal Q1 and there were no games in Q2. The current IPL tournament began on April 9, in fiscal Q3 and was suspended last week, given the COVID situation in India. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $3.99. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.61. As we move through the remainder of the year, we should start to see the benefit on Disney+ ARPU from price increases we've taken around the world. Last quarter, we guided to second quarter direct-to-consumer operating income improving modestly versus the prior year. Actual results came in significantly better versus the prior year, due to Hulu advertising sales upside, lower content and marketing expense at Hulu and Disney+ and better-than-expected ESPN+ pay-per-view results. Content sales licensing and other operating income at DMED increased in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher TV SVOD results and lower content impairments partially offset by lower home entertainment results. Higher TV SVOD results were primarily due to an increase in income from sales of episodic content, driven by sales of more profitable programs in the current period and lower write-offs. This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of film content. The decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in Q2. Moving on to our Parks Experiences and Products segment. DPEP's operating income in the second quarter decreased by $1.2 billion year-over-year as growth at consumer products was more than offset by lower results at Parks and Experiences due to the impacts of COVID-19. Our consumer products growth and operating income was due to increases at our merchandising games licensing businesses. The Parks and Experiences results were again adversely affected by COVID-19 related closures and reduced operating capacities versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris and our Cruise business were closed for all of the second quarter, whereas these businesses closed in mid-March of the prior year quarter. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for approximately 30 days during the second quarter, compared to approximately 25 days in the prior year quarter. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for all of Q2. In the prior year quarter, Disney World closed in mid-March and Shanghai closed in late January. Our parks and resorts that were opened during the quarter operated at significantly reduced capacities yet all achieved the objective of a net positive contribution, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. At Walt Disney World attendance trends continued to steadily improve throughout the second quarter, and guest spending per capita again grew by double-digit versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort reopened on April 30, and as Bob mentioned earlier, we are very encouraged by the initial guest response. Forward looking bookings for park reservations at both of our domestic parks are strong, demonstrating the strength of our brands as well as growing travel optimism as Case counts decline, vaccine distribution ramps and government restrictions loosen. Looking ahead, there are a couple of items I would like to mention. At Linear Networks, we expect a significant decline in operating income year-over-year in the third quarter, largely due to higher sports programming and production costs at ESPN, which we expect to increase by $1.2 billion versus prior year. This year's Q3 includes marquee events, such as the NBA, Major League Baseball, The Masters, Wimbledon, and the European Football Championship, which compares to Q3 of last year during which we had a limited slate of events due to COVID. At our direct-to-consumer business, we now plan to launch Star Plus, our standalone general entertainment and sports streaming service for Latin America on August 31. Moving the launch to late summer allows us to leverage a strong sports calendar, which includes the return of European soccer leagues, including La Liga, and the Premier League. Championship games for the Copa Libertadores, the prominent regional international soccer competition, along with Grand Slam tennis. As Bob mentioned earlier, we remain right on track to reach our fiscal 2024 guidance of 230 million to 260 million subs, powered by the addition of 30 million paid Disney+ subs in the first half of the year. And notwithstanding our expectation for fewer net sub adds in the second half of the year, given the COVID related suspension of the IPL season, and our decision to move the Star Plus Latin America launch to the fourth quarter. We remain very optimistic about our future. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Christine. And as we transition to the Q&A, let me note once again that since we are not all physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that, operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just starting on the direct-to-consumer side, for -- maybe for Bob, could you talk a little bit about how the price increases have landed relative to your expectations, both internationally with Star, but also in the U.S kind of the impact on churn and how that might inform your decision-making process going forward on price? And then I just wanted to ask, I think you guys generated maybe $700 million or so of free cash flow in the quarter. Normally, we don't talk a lot about quarterly free cash flow. But it's been a while, I\u2019m just wondering, Christine, if you think at this point, we're back in free cash flow positive mode going forward and expect to generate free cash flow for the year. Thank you both.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Ben. Thanks for the questions. Bob will take the first one on price response, and then Christine will take the cash flow question.\nBob Chapek: All right. Of course, these were our first price increase since we launched. I have to say that we're extremely pleased with how the market reacted to both. In the U.S., we've not observed any significantly higher churn rate since the price increased in EMEA. As we added Star as a six-brand title, we've actually seen an improvement in our churn rate. So we seem to be fairly resilient to those price increases. And as such, I think it makes us feel relatively bullish going forward that we still offer a tremendous price value relationship across the world for Disney+.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Ben, and thanks for the free cash flow question. We don't usually get those. But I would like to comment on it because it's something that we're tracking not only this year versus last year, we look at it actually weekly. But I'm also looking at it versus fiscal 2019, which I consider a more normalized year. I would say that the upside that we're really seeing and we're quite pleased with it is since we've reopened Walt Disney World, and we really don't have the impact of Disney Land yet, but we're seeing, as I mentioned, a strong per cap growth in the parks that's flowing through the parks cash numbers, and we're also seeing good strong cash flow from our direct-to-consumer businesses. So those two elements are kind of upside to what we had planned for. And I would also say that the -- there is some choppiness year-over-year, because of some of the shifts and sports rights expense timing from last year to this year. But we expect that to be more normalized this year as we get through the year. But we're looking at a more favorable free cash flow than we did when we started off the year.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks a lot.\nLowell Singer: Ben, thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. One on streaming as well and then one on the parks. How should we think about really Disney+ subscriber growth going forward? I know you gave a lot of great color in terms of how to think about the cadence for the balance of the year. And details on the growth we've seen so far -- on the impressive growth we've seen so far. But I'm wondering, if you look at what you see internally as major drivers for the step up, or step up until you get to your long-term target, is it really around certain content drops? Is it around eventually moving more into Eastern Europe or other markets in Asia? I guess what do you guys see is sort of the main drivers for sub growth? And then just a follow-up, if I can, on the parks. Any color you can provide on how we should think or how you're thinking about when it's okay to start raising capacity, attendance capacity, particularly at Walt Disney World.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Alexia. Thanks for both questions. Bob, do you want to take both of those?\nBob Chapek: Yes, I'll take them both. So on the first one, in terms of the drivers for sub growth going forward, we really see four different elements. First of all, is our content slate. As you know, we're spending a lot of money across our variety of franchises in order to create the content that's going to keep consumers coming back and keep not only our sub number growing, but also our engagement growing across all of our platforms. So the first one is content slate. The second one is our general entertainment international growth driven by our Star brand. And we think that's going to continue to fuel growth for international territories as well as Disney+. The third one is continued market expansion in markets where Disney+ has not yet been launched. And as you see, we're announcing in Malaysia today as June 1, and Thailand as June 30. So market expansion will continue to be a piece of it. But one thing that continues to impress us is the opportunity to have the bundle in the U.S be even larger. All the metrics that we see, all the performance factors are extraordinarily positive for that. So I would say those are the four components that continue to drive us and our bullishness in terms of our ability to continue to project that we're going to hit between 230 million and 260 million subs by the end of 2024. In terms of the parks, and when we're going to sort of be able to raise our capacity limits, we've actually already started that, given the guidance that just came today from the CDC, and earlier guidance that we got from the Governor of Florida, we've already started to increase our capacities. Those - obviously, today's guidance that we got from the CDC in terms of those that were vaccinated do not necessarily need to wear masks anymore, both outdoors and indoors, is very big news for us. Particularly, if anybody's been in Florida in the middle of summer with a mask on, that could be quite daunting. So we think that's going to make for an even more pleasant experience. And we believe that as we're now bringing back a lot of people back to work, that it's going to be an even bigger catalyst for growth in attendance. And we've been quite pleased to date. So I think you're going to see an immediate increase in the number of folks that were able to admit into our parks through our reservation systems that we recently implemented. So we're very, very excited about that.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Well, I have two. One is on the gross addition side of Disney+. We heard from Netflix that may have been a pull forward and maybe perhaps the reopening is impacted gross additions. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in some of the more mature or I guess develop markets on the gross addition side? And then you guys have consistently beat us OI profits, or lack of losses, I'd say, on DTC. Which of the platforms is providing the biggest surprise? And does it make you rethink maybe some of the guidance you gave around breakeven, given how strong the year has been so far on limitation of losses? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Bob, why don't you start and then we'll go over to Christine.\nBob Chapek: Okay, I'll take the first one. In terms of the additions, we've really seen it across our geographies. When you look at it from a mature versus new, every single market that we've launched in has exceeded our expectations so far in terms of the new. But in terms of mature, keep in mind that we added 30 million households in the first six months of the fiscal year, which is in line with our expectations, and domestic continues to contribute to that. The addition of the Marvel content and not only the Marvel content, but how strong it's been and the cadence of additions, and as you know, we'll soon be announcing our -- soon be launching Loki. That is a tremendous catalyst for growth for us. And in the future, as we get to more new content and serial content coming from Star Wars, we're really, really encouraged by what that's going to mean in terms of engagement, because as you know, engagement is sort of the precursor for net sub adds. And so we're very pleased with both our domestic as well as our, let's call, more mature markets, those that we've been in the marketplace for at least a year, but also our new markets as well.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. And I'll take the second part of your question, Michael, and nice to hear your voice. Look, the biggest drivers for direct-to-consumer were coming out of Hulu and Disney+. They're a little bit different. Disney+, we saw some lower content costs and that was due to some lower allocated costs for some of our own titles compared to what we had expected. And at Hulu, there was also some lower content costs, but for a different reason. It was from their third-party content that is coming -- that were delayed because of some COVID issues. So content coming in is not coming in as quickly as that they had thought, but the most important driver for Hulu is the addressable advertising strength. That continues to be a real upside. And it's going strong, and we expect that to continue. There's real demand for that addressable advertising.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks, Christine.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Michael \u2026\nMichael Nathanson: My other question was -- sorry, Lowell. Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Go ahead. Go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Nathanson: And does that make you rethink your guidance on breakeven timelines, given how strong Hulu has been?\nChristine McCarthy: No.\nMichael Nathanson: No.\nChristine McCarthy: The only guidance that we have reaffirmed was the 2024 total Disney+ global subs. Bob mentioned it, I mentioned it, that 230 million to 260 million. All the other guidance we have not reaffirmed or changed at this point. We're still going through our long-term planning cycle. So we're not making any changes now.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. Thank you, Christine.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. Your line is open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thanks. I\u2019ve just the same, parks and DTC. Some of the pictures from the parks look like it's totally full even with this reduced capacity. So now with capacity increasing, how does that relate to like kind of normal attendance? Even though you don't have international visitors, it still feels like from what we can see that it's fairly full. And you said demand strong. I just wonder if you can comment on that. And also, any update you can give us given the strong demand, how that overlays with some of the things you've talked about in the past and didn't really discuss today, but the yield management, some of the cost changes you've put in place. And then, sorry for such a longwinded question, but given the tight labor market, are there any issues that you're seeing there either on the cost side or in hiring? And then finally on DTC, I mean, this lower net adds in second half, sounds like it's coming from India, which of course is understandable, given IPL as well as COVID. But there's also likely to be an impact on ARPU, a positive impact on ARPU and I'm just wondering, how does it all translate into the operating results OI?\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jessica. So, Bob, why don't you take the parks questions? And then if you want to start on the Disney+ question, Christine, may want to jump in at the end.\nBob Chapek: Okay. So in terms of the parks demand domestically, our intent to visit at Walt Disney World is growing and is actually already flat with '19, which is obviously our last pre-COVID year. So that's really good news for us. And since we've opened up Disneyland Resort, intent to visit is actually growing as well. So we're thrilled with the guests response to that. So as capacity limits increased, we don't think we're going to have any problem at all, sort of increasing our attendance to match that capacity, that is not something that keeps any of us up at night. In terms of our yield management, as you know, we've been practicing yield management for a while. And it's really become an art form with this extraordinarily limited capacities that we've been operating yet. But you've seen the margins very healthy, our yield is growing up. From a very healthy standpoint, consumers are spending more, and we're doing it under some tremendous cost management parameters, because everything's become automated. And so we've sort of got the perfect positive storm, if you will, where we've got plenty of demand, we've got really great yield management gains and the cost management at the same time. And in terms of labor, we've had about 80% of our cast members return that we've asked to return. And obviously one of the gating factors for us to continue to increase capacity is to continue to get a more and more cast members back, it thrills us to be able to do that. But we've had no problems whatsoever in terms of trying to get our cast to come back and make some magic for our guests.\nLowell Singer: Christine? I think you\u2019re muted.\nChristine McCarthy: I'm going to talk about -- hi, Jessica. I'm going to talk about direct-to-consumer and the slower net adds expected for the second half of the year. That is, in fact the case. And it is largely due to the COVID related suspension of the IPO. And also that decision that we made to move the Star Plus Latin America launch into the fourth quarter. And once again, we did that because of the strength of the sports calendar that we would have upon launch. The other thing that's going to happen here is with the absence of the IPL games in India, that will also have an impact on advertising revenue. So you could see a decrease in the ARPU and the subs in India, if that plays out, like we just said. But the other thing is we did take price increases for domestic U.S as well as EMEA for Disney+, so our overall ARPU could benefit. So we just took the price increase in the U.S at the end of March. And we'll see how that plays out in our ARPU in the upcoming quarters.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Jessica. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Thanks for taking the question. So, Lowell, I would say sort of two areas of focus. The first you started touching on it a bit with the last series of questions, but I think one of the core thesis is that coming out of the pandemic, it's potential that the parks at Disney are more profitable than pre-pandemic. And you've talked about some of those drivers, one of them perhaps, when the parks returned to 100% of capacity, is that capacity different than it was pre-pandemic? Is it bigger? Are you smarter on pricing? Are margins structurally higher? So, one, I was just curious if you agree with that thesis at the parks could end up being more profitable coming out of the pandemic than it was going in? And then the second area, the NFL deal was obviously super interesting. And I'm curious under what circumstances would you consider doing what some peers are doing, simulcasting your football games, Friday Night football games from either ESPN or ABC onto ESPN+? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Doug, thank you. Thanks for the questions. I will turn both of them over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of park, and in terms of the relative profitability, as you know, we have -- there's a lot of negative impacts, of course, with COVID. But one of the things that it gave us a chance to do as we were forced to stop operation was to completely reexamine how we priced and programmed our tickets. And as you all know, we ended our current annual pass program at Disneyland. And that gives us a chance to sort of create a modern version of a park loyalty program and affinity program that isn't necessarily governed by legacy. And as you know the net contribution back to the company varies tremendously, and was one of the levers that we use to grow yield over the past several years, depending on what type of ticketing structure a particular guest came in. With the ability now for us to sort of completely reconsider how we go about our loyalty programs and our frequent visitor programs, we have the chance to make even more advancements, not only in terms of the guest experience and make sure that guests have a tremendous experience, no matter what day of the year they come, whether it's a high demand day, or a relatively low demand day, but also the ability to increase our per caps and our yields. And we've already seen tremendous growth in those as you're seeing over the last couple quarters. But I don't think we've even scratched the surface in terms of what we can do when we finally restart with some of our programs, in terms of making sure again, that not only do we improve the guest experience, but at the same time get an adequate return to our shareholders for the type of experience that we do give to our guests. So very positive on those factors. In terms of the ability to simulcast with ESPN+ and ESPN and ABC, that's actually been envisioned in the deals and we've gotten a lot of flexibility, not only in terms of our ability to take our programming to our DTC platforms, and things like Hulu and ABC. So that's actually been envisioned and we plan on being fairly aggressive in that way. I think that one of the advantages of The Walt Disney Company in sports is that we've got so many ways to reach our consumer base. And I think the league's understand that and we certainly do as well, and I think our guests do as well.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Doug. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So a couple, if I could. I mean, firstly, I guess, Bob, when you look at the vision for sports streaming, you now have digital rights across all the major sports that you carry on ESPN. And you've made some hard choices on the other businesses when it comes to licensing, and studios and so on in order to pivot -- make a hard pivot for streaming. But that choice with respect to sports streaming feels like it's still a couple of years off in terms of pivoting ESPN as a business completely towards streaming. So could you just talk about the longer-term vision now that your sports portfolios in place? How should we think about ESPN relative to ESPN+ and how you're thinking about the transition being accretive overall? And secondly, I guess, Christine, the guidance around the second half cadence for DTC subs. The IPL suspension, I guess could change. I think they're looking at other geographies to run the tournament. If that was to happen, would the outlook change for subscriber growth in the second half? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Kannan, thanks. Bob, I'll hand the sports question to you and then Christine, you can talk a little bit about IPL impact on subs.\nBob Chapek: We've talked a lot about -- excuse me, we talked a lot about flexibility when it comes to pivoting between linear and more traditional legacy platforms, and our digital rights direct-to-consumer platforms. And the reason we want that flexibility is because we know things are going to change. And as we've always said, when the right time comes for us to make a step function increase, as we've done with our entertainment platforms to our sports platforms and it's accretive to our shareholder proposition, we'll go ahead and do that. Our longer-term vision is to parallel path both ESPN and ESPN+, but if there's any indication of where we're going with this, I think our recent deals and the flexibility that we've negotiated in to go to these direct-to-consumer platforms and specifically ESPN+ or whatever follows ESPN+ in terms of the direct-to-consumer platform, I think that's 100% indicative of our bullishness of not only our capability of doing that, but the viability of doing that.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Kannan. And your question around if they move the IPL. About half of the 60 IPL matches that were expected to be played this season have already taken place. So you're looking at the back half 30 games to be played. So sure if they were able to successfully relocate the tournament, we would hopefully see an impact, especially on advertising. And so there would be a positive what we're expecting. It would be better than if there were no rescheduled. The big issue is going to be when in the quarter and if it overlaps into Q4, or if it goes into the first fiscal quarter, which starts for us and the beginning of October. So it would have a -- it would have an impact on it, it just depends on when it would come in. So let's hope they are able to relocate it.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Got it. Thank you, both.\nLowell Singer: Hey, Kannan, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thank you, guys. Maybe keeping with the sports rights question, it does look like you guys are sort of bulking up on sports rights. Would you say you still have demand for additional rights, if the economics made sense and I think thinking sort of Sunday Ticket or the EPL? Or is there sort of a level that you get to in terms of spending where you feel you need to cut it off? And then given all the rights and the digital platform, are -- is the sports gambling become a bigger opportunity for the company and something that you expect to go deeper into? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: John, thank you. Bob, do you want to take those?\nBob Chapek: Yes, thank you. In terms of the sports rights, we've just recently closed MLB, La Liga, NFL, NHL. So we certainly as you have suggested have a full complement of sports to please almost anybody. And you take that in addition to the NBA rights that we have and yes, we're -- we've got a full house there. In terms of our appetite for going further, in terms of what's really left, there's not much, you mentioned Sunday ticket and that's something that we're in conversations with and we're considering and we're thinking about it. Obviously, it's an attractive property, but we'll only do it just like our other rights, if it is something that adds shareholder value. And that's the filter that we'll continue to look for. And we're really happy with, frankly, the deals that we've got in terms of representing things that are accretive to our shareholders so far. And we'll take that same approach going forward. In terms of the gambling opportunity, as you know, we stuck our toe in this water in the last couple of years in terms of sports links with a few of the players out there. And I think going forward, we see this as an opportunity. We seized an opportunity, we know that it represents very little risk to the company and very little risk to ESPN. As a matter of fact, it's actually -- it builds the brand equity from the research that we've had in terms of some of the younger audience that follow sports because it's such an integral part of the experience. And so we think it's actually a growth vehicle for us, but we'll walk into it carefully and monitor it carefully, but we have a greater appetite to do more and more in that area.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Bob.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, John. Operator, we have time for one more question today.\nOperator: We have a question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned during your prepared remarks, the three primary ways you look to release theatrical content, whether it's in the theatres or on your direct-to-consumer platforms. And one of those methods is a simultaneous release in the theatres and Premier Access. And I can understand during COVID, when it was very unlikely that people would be in theatres, but that was a reasonably easy call. It seems like this could be a little trickier to make a decision around when a film has the right characteristics for that type of release model going forward. So I was hoping you can maybe give us an insight in terms of what you're weighing when you make that decision. And in particular, with your big franchises, for example, you'll be doing this with Black Widow. What gives you conviction that you can build and nurture and create a lot of enthusiasm around those mega franchises without at least some limited theatrical window. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Brett. Bob, do you want to take that?\nBob Chapek: Yes, I'm going to take the second one first. If there's any marker in terms of our ability to continue to build franchises, we know theatrical is a proven way to do that. But our merchandise sales on Mandalorian that never had a theatrical release is certainly one extraordinary marker in terms of the fact that while theatrical continues to be a great way for us to build franchises, our first big data point using our Disney+ platform to sell merchandise has been extraordinarily successful for us as well. In terms of the Premier Access, you're absolutely right. As we get into a situation where we're trying to monitor our consumers ready to go back into theatres, of course, 90%, let's say of the domestic marketplace is open right now. And we're encouraged in terms of polling in terms of that growing going forward. But if you look at last weekend's box office for an example, and you compare it versus an average over the last 3 years of pre-COVID box office, it was 85% below domestically and 63% below -- 67% below internationally. So we know the markets not quite there yet. So the Disney Premier Access strategy, one of the things that gives us right now, and we're grateful for this is the ability to go ahead and try to release things into the market and try to reprime the pump, if you will. But at the same time, know that for those consumers that are a little leery still about going into a packed theatre, that they can go ahead and watch it in the safety and convenience of their home. In terms of going beyond this fiscal year, we've not announced exactly what our strategy is going to be in terms of which titles will be theatrical plus Disney Premier Access, which ones will be direct to Disney+, or which ones will go into theatres. But know that we'll continue to watch the evolution of the recovery of the theatrical marketplace. And we'll use that flexibility to make the right call at the right time. But right now, we've only called those films that are in this fiscal year because of the relatively fluid nature of the recovery of exhibition.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Brett, thanks for the question.

            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter increased 32% versus the prior year to $0.79 per share. We are beginning to see progress in many of our businesses after more than a year of adverse impacts from the pandemic. While we are not out of the woods yet, we are pleased with our results this quarter at both our DMED and DPEP businesses. I will walk through our results by segments, starting with Media and Entertainment Distribution. Operating income at the segment increased by 74% in the second quarter versus the prior year, due to higher results across all of the segments lines of business. At Linear Networks, the increase was driven by growth at both our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income increased versus the prior year. Higher results at cable were driven by lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue partially offset by lower advertising revenue. ESPN's results were in line with the guidance we gave last quarter, and ESPN was the most significant contributor to cables growth this quarter. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. As we mentioned last quarter, fiscal Q2 included only one CFP Bowl game, the National Championship compared to four in the prior year quarter, three CFP Bowl games and the national championship game. Cable programming and production costs also benefited in the quarter from lower production costs for other live sporting events and lower programming costs at Freeform. Lower advertising revenue at cable was primarily due to lower average viewership. At ESPN, domestic advertising revenue decreased significantly in the quarter driven by lower ratings for key programming, in addition to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. Quarter to date, domestic advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing up significantly versus last year, benefiting from the prior year's lack of significant live sports programming due to COVID. At broadcasting, higher results were driven by growth at ABC, partially offset by a decrease at the owned television stations. At ABC, lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Programming and production costs were impacted by the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which took place in the third quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. Lower advertising revenue was primarily driven by lower average viewership and the timing of the Academy Awards partially offset by higher rates. On our Q1 earnings call, we said we expected the Academy Awards timing shift and lower political advertising at our own stations would negatively impact broadcasting results in the second quarter versus the prior year. While we did see those specific adverse impacts play out, overall broadcasting results were higher than we expected, driven by lower marketing spend due to timing shifts of some new series, in addition to a number of other smaller factors. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 5% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating results at international channels increased due to a decrease in programming and production costs and an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. Lower programming and production costs in the second quarter were driven by a higher percentage of content cost being allocated to our DTC business rather than our networks business as we continue the international expansion of Disney+ and Star, in addition to channel closures over the past year. Advertising revenue increased primarily due to the timing of BCCI cricket matches, which generally take place in the first quarter, but were in the second quarter this year due to COVID related timing shifts. Lower affiliate revenue at our international channels was due to channel closures as well as an unfavorable foreign currency impact. At our direct-to-consumer businesses, operating results in the quarter improved by over $500 million versus the prior year due to stronger results at Hulu, and ESPN+. The increase at Hulu was due to subscriber revenue growth and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs related to the Hulu Live TV service. Hulu ended the second quarter with 41.6 million paid subscribers, up from 39.4 million in Q1, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live declined modestly to 3.8 million from 4 million at the end of Q1, which we attribute primarily to the $10 price increase we took in December, in addition to a modest impact from seasonality. At ESPN+, improved year over year results were driven by subscriber growth and an increase from UFC pay-per-view events. ESPN+ had 13.8 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter. At Disney+, results were comparable to the prior year quarter, as an increase in subscribers was largely offset by higher content, marketing and technology costs. As Bob mentioned earlier, we had almost 104 million Disney+ paid subscribers at the end of the second quarter. At our Annual Meeting, we announced we have reached 100 million global paid subscribers. We reached that milestone in early March. So we added subs at a faster pace in the last month of the second quarter than we did in the first 2 months. And that was despite no major market launches, a price increase in EMEA and a domestic price increase towards the end of the quarter. We attribute this success to the strength of our overall content slate. The launch of the Star general entertainment offering in many markets and the continued growth of Disney+ Hotstar. Between Q1 and Q2, Disney+ Hotstar was the strongest contributor to net subscriber additions, making up approximately a third of the total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the second quarter. However, ARPU at Disney+ Hotstar was down significantly versus the first quarter due to lower advertising revenue as a result of the timing of IPL cricket matches and the impact of COVID in India. As a reminder, the majority of the prior IPL tournament took place in fiscal Q1 and there were no games in Q2. The current IPL tournament began on April 9, in fiscal Q3 and was suspended last week, given the COVID situation in India. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $3.99. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.61. As we move through the remainder of the year, we should start to see the benefit on Disney+ ARPU from price increases we've taken around the world. Last quarter, we guided to second quarter direct-to-consumer operating income improving modestly versus the prior year. Actual results came in significantly better versus the prior year, due to Hulu advertising sales upside, lower content and marketing expense at Hulu and Disney+ and better-than-expected ESPN+ pay-per-view results. Content sales licensing and other operating income at DMED increased in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher TV SVOD results and lower content impairments partially offset by lower home entertainment results. Higher TV SVOD results were primarily due to an increase in income from sales of episodic content, driven by sales of more profitable programs in the current period and lower write-offs. This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of film content. The decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in Q2. Moving on to our Parks Experiences and Products segment. DPEP's operating income in the second quarter decreased by $1.2 billion year-over-year as growth at consumer products was more than offset by lower results at Parks and Experiences due to the impacts of COVID-19. Our consumer products growth and operating income was due to increases at our merchandising games licensing businesses. The Parks and Experiences results were again adversely affected by COVID-19 related closures and reduced operating capacities versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris and our Cruise business were closed for all of the second quarter, whereas these businesses closed in mid-March of the prior year quarter. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for approximately 30 days during the second quarter, compared to approximately 25 days in the prior year quarter. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for all of Q2. In the prior year quarter, Disney World closed in mid-March and Shanghai closed in late January. Our parks and resorts that were opened during the quarter operated at significantly reduced capacities yet all achieved the objective of a net positive contribution, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. At Walt Disney World attendance trends continued to steadily improve throughout the second quarter, and guest spending per capita again grew by double-digit versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort reopened on April 30, and as Bob mentioned earlier, we are very encouraged by the initial guest response. Forward looking bookings for park reservations at both of our domestic parks are strong, demonstrating the strength of our brands as well as growing travel optimism as Case counts decline, vaccine distribution ramps and government restrictions loosen. Looking ahead, there are a couple of items I would like to mention. At Linear Networks, we expect a significant decline in operating income year-over-year in the third quarter, largely due to higher sports programming and production costs at ESPN, which we expect to increase by $1.2 billion versus prior year. This year's Q3 includes marquee events, such as the NBA, Major League Baseball, The Masters, Wimbledon, and the European Football Championship, which compares to Q3 of last year during which we had a limited slate of events due to COVID. At our direct-to-consumer business, we now plan to launch Star Plus, our standalone general entertainment and sports streaming service for Latin America on August 31. Moving the launch to late summer allows us to leverage a strong sports calendar, which includes the return of European soccer leagues, including La Liga, and the Premier League. Championship games for the Copa Libertadores, the prominent regional international soccer competition, along with Grand Slam tennis. As Bob mentioned earlier, we remain right on track to reach our fiscal 2024 guidance of 230 million to 260 million subs, powered by the addition of 30 million paid Disney+ subs in the first half of the year. And notwithstanding our expectation for fewer net sub adds in the second half of the year, given the COVID related suspension of the IPL season, and our decision to move the Star Plus Latin America launch to the fourth quarter. We remain very optimistic about our future. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions. Hi, Ben, and thanks for the free cash flow question. We don't usually get those. But I would like to comment on it because it's something that we're tracking not only this year versus last year, we look at it actually weekly. But I'm also looking at it versus fiscal 2019, which I consider a more normalized year. I would say that the upside that we're really seeing and we're quite pleased with it is since we've reopened Walt Disney World, and we really don't have the impact of Disney Land yet, but we're seeing, as I mentioned, a strong per cap growth in the parks that's flowing through the parks cash numbers, and we're also seeing good strong cash flow from our direct-to-consumer businesses. So those two elements are kind of upside to what we had planned for. And I would also say that the -- there is some choppiness year-over-year, because of some of the shifts and sports rights expense timing from last year to this year. But we expect that to be more normalized this year as we get through the year. But we're looking at a more favorable free cash flow than we did when we started off the year. Okay. And I'll take the second part of your question, Michael, and nice to hear your voice. Look, the biggest drivers for direct-to-consumer were coming out of Hulu and Disney+. They're a little bit different. Disney+, we saw some lower content costs and that was due to some lower allocated costs for some of our own titles compared to what we had expected. And at Hulu, there was also some lower content costs, but for a different reason. It was from their third-party content that is coming -- that were delayed because of some COVID issues. So content coming in is not coming in as quickly as that they had thought, but the most important driver for Hulu is the addressable advertising strength. That continues to be a real upside. And it's going strong, and we expect that to continue. There's real demand for that addressable advertising. No. The only guidance that we have reaffirmed was the 2024 total Disney+ global subs. Bob mentioned it, I mentioned it, that 230 million to 260 million. All the other guidance we have not reaffirmed or changed at this point. We're still going through our long-term planning cycle. So we're not making any changes now. I'm going to talk about -- hi, Jessica. I'm going to talk about direct-to-consumer and the slower net adds expected for the second half of the year. That is, in fact the case. And it is largely due to the COVID related suspension of the IPO. And also that decision that we made to move the Star Plus Latin America launch into the fourth quarter. And once again, we did that because of the strength of the sports calendar that we would have upon launch. The other thing that's going to happen here is with the absence of the IPL games in India, that will also have an impact on advertising revenue. So you could see a decrease in the ARPU and the subs in India, if that plays out, like we just said. But the other thing is we did take price increases for domestic U.S as well as EMEA for Disney+, so our overall ARPU could benefit. So we just took the price increase in the U.S at the end of March. And we'll see how that plays out in our ARPU in the upcoming quarters. Hi, Kannan. And your question around if they move the IPL. About half of the 60 IPL matches that were expected to be played this season have already taken place. So you're looking at the back half 30 games to be played. So sure if they were able to successfully relocate the tournament, we would hopefully see an impact, especially on advertising. And so there would be a positive what we're expecting. It would be better than if there were no rescheduled. The big issue is going to be when in the quarter and if it overlaps into Q4, or if it goes into the first fiscal quarter, which starts for us and the beginning of October. So it would have a -- it would have an impact on it, it just depends on when it would come in. So let's hope they are able to relocate it."

            "name": "Bob Chapek",
            "content": "Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS of 32% to $0.79, compared to $0.60 last year. And since then, we've continued to make progress across our businesses as we remain laser-focused on our ongoing recovery, while also fueling long-term growth. Our strategic focus continues in three key areas. First is direct-to-consumer. We successfully launched our streaming offerings, Disney+ and Star, in a number of markets internationally. And we've been pleased with the growth and engagement in those markets to date. Our steady cadence of new high-quality branded content, along with our robust collection of library titles, allows us to continually attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. At the same time, we are also closely monitoring the recovery of theatrical exhibition, as consumers begin to return to theatres, and I'll talk more about the specifics later. Finally, we are focused on the ongoing recovery of our parks business and the resumption of Disney Cruise Line. There have been some encouraging developments in recent months, particularly with the ongoing rollout of the vaccine and the gradual lifting of government mandated restrictions. And through this time, we've taken advantage of the opportunity to make improvements to our operating procedures to enhance the guest experience through the use of technology innovations, new ticketing strategies, and other offerings. We are especially excited that after being closed for 412 days, we welcomed our first guests back to Disneyland two weeks ago and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Bob and I stood on Main Street USA on opening day, and it was so wonderful to see the joy on our cast and guests' faces and feel the excitement in the air. It's been fantastic to see cast members back at work. Most recently at Disneyland, we were able to quickly recall more than 10,000 furloughed cast and retrain them to be able to operate to the State of California's new health and safety requirements. We continue to see strong growing demand from consumers as we are at or near our reduced capacity levels at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland for the current quarter. It's clear our guests are excited to get back to experiencing the magic of Disney and they also have extraordinary confidence in our safety protocols. At Shanghai Disney Resort, where they just kicked off their year-long 5th anniversary celebration, the park is operating at or above FY 2019 levels. We're also encouraged by what we're seeing at Hong Kong Disneyland, and we are hopeful we will be able to announce a reopening date for Disneyland Paris soon. Despite the pandemic, we continue to make progress on a number of highly anticipated projects at our parks around the world, including the all new Avengers Campus, which is set to open at Disney California Adventure on June 4. I had a chance to visit recently and the attractions and multiple state-of-the-art experiences are truly phenomenal. We recently unveiled our newest cruise ship, the Disney Wish to the public with a virtual live stream presentation that has been viewed nearly 1.2 million times. The ship is amazing and it includes the AquaMouse water ride, the first ever Disney attraction at sea. The Disney Wish will set sail on its maiden voyage in 2022 and bookings open to the general public on May 27. On the studio side, we are pleased to be nearing full production levels, and we are also significantly ramping up content creation at our studios consistent with the guidance we provided at Investor Day. An example of this is 20th Century and Searchlight Pictures, where they are gradually increasing output and will reach a steady state of 15 and 20 films, respectively, to fuel our general entertainment offerings across all of our distribution platforms. We're incredibly proud that Searchlight's Nomadland took home Oscars for best actress, best director, with Chloe\u0301 Zhao becoming the first woman of color to win the award and best picture. That's five best picture wins since 2009 and 43 Academy Awards in total. Additionally, Pixar's stellar record of award-winning films continues with the Studio's animated masterpiece, Soul, which took home Oscars for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score. And I'm happy to say that now millions are able to enjoy Soul on Disney+ and Nomadland on Hulu. As we have consistently stated, flexibility is a key component of our distribution strategy. And we have outlined three approaches for distributing our films. Releases in theatres with a simultaneous offering via Disney+ Premier Access releases straight to Disney+ and traditional exclusive theatrical releases. Here's how this translates to our tremendous upcoming film slate. Cruella will be released in theatres and via Disney+ Premier Access on May 28, followed by Pixar's Luca, which will be released exclusively at Disney+ on June 18. The highly anticipated Black Widow will be in theatres and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 9, and Disney's Jungle Cruise, hilarious adventure filled expedition, will be available in theatres and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 30. I'm pleased to announce today that amidst recent signs of increased consumer confidence in movie going; two films, 20th Century's exciting comedy, Free Guy; and Marvel's action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, will be released with a 45-day exclusive theatrical window on August 13 and September 3, respectively. And of course, regardless of where they originate, all of our films and episodic series will end up as part of the robust library of content on our DTC platforms. Like our films, our Disney+ original series have become must-watch events. Starting with the success of The Mandalorian followed by Marvel's WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. These not only became immediate hits, but part of the cultural zeitgeist. And the anticipation for Marvel's newest series, Loki, which debuts on June 9 has been through the roof. The second season of High School Musical, The Musical, The Series, the all new The Mysterious Benedict Society based on the popular young adult book series, and the animated series Monsters at Work are also coming to Disney+ in the next couple of months, just to name a few. We are uniquely positioned with the most compelling brands and franchises in entertainment. And we continue to deliver the high-quality, one-of-a-kind content that consumers want. That's clearly reflected in the success of Disney+, which amassed nearly 104 million paid subscribers as of the end of the second fiscal quarter. We are on track to achieve our guidance of 230 million to 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. Looking at our entire portfolio streaming services, we expect that as full production levels resumed and we get to a more normalized cycle, the increased output will help fuel additional sub growth across Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Hotstar. Hulu and ESPN+ had 41.6 million and 13.8 million paid subscribers, respectively, at the end of the quarter. On Hulu, buzz-worthy content continues to boost performance, including the award-winning Hulu original film, the United States vs. Billie Holiday, and Season 4 of The Handmaid's Tale, which premiered to the biggest audience ever for a Hulu original. And there's lots more coming to Hulu, including Marvel's new animated series, M.O.D.O.K.; Season 2 of the hit series, Love, Victor; and Season 10 of the wildly popular anthology, American Horror Story on FX on Hulu. In March, we launched ESPN+ on Hulu and we are very pleased with its early progress. Viewers who subscribe to both Hulu and ESPN+, are able to watch and engage with the great content that's available on ESPN+ without leaving the Hulu environment. ESPN+ programming includes thousands of live sporting events, original shows, series and documentaries with the UFC lightweight Championship by airing live on ESPN+ pay-per-view on May 15. The final match of the FA Cup also on May 15, followed by the PGA Championship, Wimbledon, and the highly anticipated third UFC matchup between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor on pay-per-view, July 10. Not to mention the incredible additions to our lineup, including NHL and more college football in the fall. Live sports are a very important component of our content business. And even admits the challenges of the past year, we have continued to build our unrivalled portfolio of sports rights in a disciplined way. While our overall strategy is still very supportive of our linear business, given the important economic value address for the company, we're also building out our ESPN+ direct-to-consumer offering and with every deal we make, we are considering both the linear and DTC components. With this strategy in mind, we've reached a number of long-term accretive deals that each play a very specific role as part of our sports portfolio. Some are weighted more towards linear with a significant digital component, such as the NFL and SEC deals, others reflecting an emphasis on direct-to-consumer. These include agreements with the UFC, the PGA Tour, Bundesliga, and the NHL. For example, as part of a 7-year rights deal with the NHL, 75 of the leagues live National Games will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ will be the sole home for more than 1,000 out of market NHL games, further submitting the service as a must have for hockey fans. And today, I'm excited to announce two additional sports rights deals. We've reached a renewal deal through 2028 with Major League Baseball with 30 exclusive regular season games, which include 25 Sunday night baseball games, and opening night annually. Coverage of the highly anticipated potential expanded Wild Card Series and the option to simulcast all live MLB coverage from ESPN networks on ESPN+. We've also signed a historic rights agreement with the top division in Spanish club football, La Liga. La Liga is one of the world's best and most popular soccer leagues, including a number of the top clubs in the world, and one of the best players in the world, Lionel Messi. And this 8-year deal, covering both English and Spanish language rights, brings 380 La Liga matches and a host of La Liga two matches per season to ESPN+, beginning in August. And this deal bolsters ESPN+'s position as a top destination for soccer in the U.S., offering fans more than 2,900 matches per season. When you combine the unparalleled assets of the Walt Disney Company, ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, plus our highly engaging digital and social content, it's clear that Disney is the absolute leader when it comes to serving our sports fans in the most effective way possible. We believe in the power of live sports, and are confident our multi-platform rights deals we've made will provide us tremendous value now and into the future. Overall, we are pleased with the encouraging signs of recovery across our businesses, and we are confident we continue to move in the right direction for our future growth. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Christine and she'll talk more in depth about our results for the quarter. All right. Of course, these were our first price increase since we launched. I have to say that we're extremely pleased with how the market reacted to both. In the U.S., we've not observed any significantly higher churn rate since the price increased in EMEA. As we added Star as a six-brand title, we've actually seen an improvement in our churn rate. So we seem to be fairly resilient to those price increases. And as such, I think it makes us feel relatively bullish going forward that we still offer a tremendous price value relationship across the world for Disney+. Yes, I'll take them both. So on the first one, in terms of the drivers for sub growth going forward, we really see four different elements. First of all, is our content slate. As you know, we're spending a lot of money across our variety of franchises in order to create the content that's going to keep consumers coming back and keep not only our sub number growing, but also our engagement growing across all of our platforms. So the first one is content slate. The second one is our general entertainment international growth driven by our Star brand. And we think that's going to continue to fuel growth for international territories as well as Disney+. The third one is continued market expansion in markets where Disney+ has not yet been launched. And as you see, we're announcing in Malaysia today as June 1, and Thailand as June 30. So market expansion will continue to be a piece of it. But one thing that continues to impress us is the opportunity to have the bundle in the U.S be even larger. All the metrics that we see, all the performance factors are extraordinarily positive for that. So I would say those are the four components that continue to drive us and our bullishness in terms of our ability to continue to project that we're going to hit between 230 million and 260 million subs by the end of 2024. In terms of the parks, and when we're going to sort of be able to raise our capacity limits, we've actually already started that, given the guidance that just came today from the CDC, and earlier guidance that we got from the Governor of Florida, we've already started to increase our capacities. Those - obviously, today's guidance that we got from the CDC in terms of those that were vaccinated do not necessarily need to wear masks anymore, both outdoors and indoors, is very big news for us. Particularly, if anybody's been in Florida in the middle of summer with a mask on, that could be quite daunting. So we think that's going to make for an even more pleasant experience. And we believe that as we're now bringing back a lot of people back to work, that it's going to be an even bigger catalyst for growth in attendance. And we've been quite pleased to date. So I think you're going to see an immediate increase in the number of folks that were able to admit into our parks through our reservation systems that we recently implemented. So we're very, very excited about that. Okay, I'll take the first one. In terms of the additions, we've really seen it across our geographies. When you look at it from a mature versus new, every single market that we've launched in has exceeded our expectations so far in terms of the new. But in terms of mature, keep in mind that we added 30 million households in the first six months of the fiscal year, which is in line with our expectations, and domestic continues to contribute to that. The addition of the Marvel content and not only the Marvel content, but how strong it's been and the cadence of additions, and as you know, we'll soon be announcing our -- soon be launching Loki. That is a tremendous catalyst for growth for us. And in the future, as we get to more new content and serial content coming from Star Wars, we're really, really encouraged by what that's going to mean in terms of engagement, because as you know, engagement is sort of the precursor for net sub adds. And so we're very pleased with both our domestic as well as our, let's call, more mature markets, those that we've been in the marketplace for at least a year, but also our new markets as well. Okay. So in terms of the parks demand domestically, our intent to visit at Walt Disney World is growing and is actually already flat with '19, which is obviously our last pre-COVID year. So that's really good news for us. And since we've opened up Disneyland Resort, intent to visit is actually growing as well. So we're thrilled with the guests response to that. So as capacity limits increased, we don't think we're going to have any problem at all, sort of increasing our attendance to match that capacity, that is not something that keeps any of us up at night. In terms of our yield management, as you know, we've been practicing yield management for a while. And it's really become an art form with this extraordinarily limited capacities that we've been operating yet. But you've seen the margins very healthy, our yield is growing up. From a very healthy standpoint, consumers are spending more, and we're doing it under some tremendous cost management parameters, because everything's become automated. And so we've sort of got the perfect positive storm, if you will, where we've got plenty of demand, we've got really great yield management gains and the cost management at the same time. And in terms of labor, we've had about 80% of our cast members return that we've asked to return. And obviously one of the gating factors for us to continue to increase capacity is to continue to get a more and more cast members back, it thrills us to be able to do that. But we've had no problems whatsoever in terms of trying to get our cast to come back and make some magic for our guests. Okay. In terms of park, and in terms of the relative profitability, as you know, we have -- there's a lot of negative impacts, of course, with COVID. But one of the things that it gave us a chance to do as we were forced to stop operation was to completely reexamine how we priced and programmed our tickets. And as you all know, we ended our current annual pass program at Disneyland. And that gives us a chance to sort of create a modern version of a park loyalty program and affinity program that isn't necessarily governed by legacy. And as you know the net contribution back to the company varies tremendously, and was one of the levers that we use to grow yield over the past several years, depending on what type of ticketing structure a particular guest came in. With the ability now for us to sort of completely reconsider how we go about our loyalty programs and our frequent visitor programs, we have the chance to make even more advancements, not only in terms of the guest experience and make sure that guests have a tremendous experience, no matter what day of the year they come, whether it's a high demand day, or a relatively low demand day, but also the ability to increase our per caps and our yields. And we've already seen tremendous growth in those as you're seeing over the last couple quarters. But I don't think we've even scratched the surface in terms of what we can do when we finally restart with some of our programs, in terms of making sure again, that not only do we improve the guest experience, but at the same time get an adequate return to our shareholders for the type of experience that we do give to our guests. So very positive on those factors. In terms of the ability to simulcast with ESPN+ and ESPN and ABC, that's actually been envisioned in the deals and we've gotten a lot of flexibility, not only in terms of our ability to take our programming to our DTC platforms, and things like Hulu and ABC. So that's actually been envisioned and we plan on being fairly aggressive in that way. I think that one of the advantages of The Walt Disney Company in sports is that we've got so many ways to reach our consumer base. And I think the league's understand that and we certainly do as well, and I think our guests do as well. We've talked a lot about -- excuse me, we talked a lot about flexibility when it comes to pivoting between linear and more traditional legacy platforms, and our digital rights direct-to-consumer platforms. And the reason we want that flexibility is because we know things are going to change. And as we've always said, when the right time comes for us to make a step function increase, as we've done with our entertainment platforms to our sports platforms and it's accretive to our shareholder proposition, we'll go ahead and do that. Our longer-term vision is to parallel path both ESPN and ESPN+, but if there's any indication of where we're going with this, I think our recent deals and the flexibility that we've negotiated in to go to these direct-to-consumer platforms and specifically ESPN+ or whatever follows ESPN+ in terms of the direct-to-consumer platform, I think that's 100% indicative of our bullishness of not only our capability of doing that, but the viability of doing that. Yes, thank you. In terms of the sports rights, we've just recently closed MLB, La Liga, NFL, NHL. So we certainly as you have suggested have a full complement of sports to please almost anybody. And you take that in addition to the NBA rights that we have and yes, we're -- we've got a full house there. In terms of our appetite for going further, in terms of what's really left, there's not much, you mentioned Sunday ticket and that's something that we're in conversations with and we're considering and we're thinking about it. Obviously, it's an attractive property, but we'll only do it just like our other rights, if it is something that adds shareholder value. And that's the filter that we'll continue to look for. And we're really happy with, frankly, the deals that we've got in terms of representing things that are accretive to our shareholders so far. And we'll take that same approach going forward. In terms of the gambling opportunity, as you know, we stuck our toe in this water in the last couple of years in terms of sports links with a few of the players out there. And I think going forward, we see this as an opportunity. We seized an opportunity, we know that it represents very little risk to the company and very little risk to ESPN. As a matter of fact, it's actually -- it builds the brand equity from the research that we've had in terms of some of the younger audience that follow sports because it's such an integral part of the experience. And so we think it's actually a growth vehicle for us, but we'll walk into it carefully and monitor it carefully, but we have a greater appetite to do more and more in that area. Yes, I'm going to take the second one first. If there's any marker in terms of our ability to continue to build franchises, we know theatrical is a proven way to do that. But our merchandise sales on Mandalorian that never had a theatrical release is certainly one extraordinary marker in terms of the fact that while theatrical continues to be a great way for us to build franchises, our first big data point using our Disney+ platform to sell merchandise has been extraordinarily successful for us as well. In terms of the Premier Access, you're absolutely right. As we get into a situation where we're trying to monitor our consumers ready to go back into theatres, of course, 90%, let's say of the domestic marketplace is open right now. And we're encouraged in terms of polling in terms of that growing going forward. But if you look at last weekend's box office for an example, and you compare it versus an average over the last 3 years of pre-COVID box office, it was 85% below domestically and 63% below -- 67% below internationally. So we know the markets not quite there yet. So the Disney Premier Access strategy, one of the things that gives us right now, and we're grateful for this is the ability to go ahead and try to release things into the market and try to reprime the pump, if you will. But at the same time, know that for those consumers that are a little leery still about going into a packed theatre, that they can go ahead and watch it in the safety and convenience of their home. In terms of going beyond this fiscal year, we've not announced exactly what our strategy is going to be in terms of which titles will be theatrical plus Disney Premier Access, which ones will be direct to Disney+, or which ones will go into theatres. But know that we'll continue to watch the evolution of the recovery of the theatrical marketplace. And we'll use that flexibility to make the right call at the right time. But right now, we've only called those films that are in this fiscal year because of the relatively fluid nature of the recovery of exhibition."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's first quarter 2021 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at, www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a transcript will also be posted to our website. We realize most of you are still joining us today from your homes. And we are once again hosting today's call remotely. So joining me from their homes are, Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Lowell, and hello everyone. I hope, you're all doing well and staying safe. Unfortunately, as you know, the COVID pandemic continues to present significant hurdles, for businesses and communities across the US and globally. And most important, it has taken a tragic toll, on way too many lives. Fortunately, there have been some encouraging developments, particularly with the availability of the vaccine. And we're pleased to be doing our part, by providing space at Disneyland for one of Southern California's major vaccine distribution sites. To-date more than 100,000 doses have been administered at our location. It's hard to believe nearly a year has passed since the start of the pandemic, which continues to negatively impact the operations of our company. For the first quarter, adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.32 a share, compared to $1.53 a share last year. Christine will talk more in-depth about our results for the quarter. During this difficult time we have made significant changes while finding new and innovative ways to conduct our businesses. But at the same time, we have chartered a course for an even more deliberate and aggressive DTC push for Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Star. I'm really proud of how well our team has performed, in the face of a multitude of ongoing challenges, both creatively and across our parks and experiences, and legacy and DTC distribution platforms. We've been especially pleased with the success of our direct-to-consumer business. And our recent strategic reorganization has enabled us to accelerate the company's pivot, towards a DTC-first business model and further grow our streaming services. Disney+ has exceeded even our highest expectations, in just over a year since its launch with 94.9 million subscribers, as of the end of the first fiscal quarter. ESPN+ and Hulu have also performed well, with 12.1 million and 39.4 million subscriptions, respectively. And on February 23rd, we will be launching our new international general entertainment offering Star, across Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. Star will offer thousands of hours of movies and television from the company's multiple studios, including content from our acquisition of 21st Century Fox, along with Star-branded exclusive originals and local programming, tailored to specific markets. Star will be integrated into Disney+, as a distinct sixth brand tile. And will offer easy to use, parental controls to manage access to the content available on Star. We're less than two weeks away from launch and we're seeing tremendous excitement amongst consumers. As you saw during our Investor Day presentation, we've got an amazing robust pipeline of original content in development and production, for our full portfolio of streaming services. We have some of the best creative teams in the business. And that's reflected in the tremendous appeal, of our unparalleled programming. In just the last two months, Disney+ has delivered a string of hit programs, including Marvel's incredibly original WandaVision, season two of The Mandalorian which ended with the surprise reveal that fan favorite Boba Fett will have his own Disney+ series starting this December; and Pixar's artistic triumph Soul, which debuted on the service and in theatres on Christmas Day to great acclaim and has since taken in nearly $100 million at the global box office. The wealth of IP from our unrivaled collection of brands and franchises provides us with an incredible breadth and depth of storylines and characters to mine for Disney+ and our other streaming services. We have the ability to interconnect these storylines and characters in unprecedented ways as we saw with The Mandalorian and WandaVision tying into the broader Star Wars and Marvel franchises. We're excited to continue exploring the endless possibilities that this unique ecosystem provides. The fan response was overwhelming when we announced last week that Ryan Coogler who's hard at work on Black Panther 2 will be developing a Black Panther inspired series based in the Kingdom of Wakanda for Disney+. We're also thrilled to be expanding the scope and reach of ESPN's, The Undefeated by creating a destination on Hulu devoted to black entertainment and culture, another example of our continuing commitment and investment in diversity and inclusion, and we can't wait for the award winning and critically acclaimed film, Nomadland, to be released in theatres and on Hulu on February 19th. And on March 5th, Disney Animation Studios Raya and the Last Dragon, an artistically beautiful film celebrating female empowerment will arrive in theatres and on Disney+ via our Premier Access. As we've said our goal is to increasingly put the consumer in charge and let them decide when and how they want to enjoy our one of a kind entertainment offerings. Turning to other parts of the company. We've made a number of changes in how we manage and operate our theme parks and consumer products businesses in light of the disruptions caused by the pandemic. And we believe these and other adjustments we'll continue to make will best position us to operate more effectively now and in a post-COVID environment. Where we have been able to reopen our theme parks with limited capacity, guests have consistently demonstrated a willingness and a desire to visit, which we believe is a testament to the fact that they feel confident in the health and safety protocols we put in place. Average daily attendance at Walt Disney World grew significantly from Q4 into Q1, helped in part by the increased capacity we've been able to achieve as a result of our successful protocols. It's clear that people want to reconnect with loved ones and spend time together doing things they enjoy. And given the demand we're seeing now, we're confident we'll only grow once the pandemic is behind us. Even under difficult circumstances, we've been able to continue expanding our parks. At Walt Disney World Resort we're hard at work on two brand-new attractions at Epcot, Remy's Ratatouille Adventure and the highly anticipated Marvel themed rollercoaster, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind. Work is also well-underway on the all-new spectacular nighttime show, Harmonious. This is all part of a much larger reimagining of Epcot to make it more Disney, more family friendly, more timeless and more magical. And I'm especially excited about the progress that's been made on the new Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser hotel at Walt Disney World. People are going to be blown away by the experience. It is truly unlike anything we've done before. At Disneyland Resort the exciting new Marvel themed land, Avengers Campus is currently scheduled to open later this year at Disney California Adventure. And crews are hard at work on the highly anticipated state-of-the-art attraction Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway coming to Disneyland in 2023. We're also moving forward on a number of new projects at our international parks. At Shanghai Disneyland, work continues on the first ever Zootopia themed land. This fully immersive area will seamlessly blend Disney storytelling with advanced technologies, creating a one of a kind experience for our guests. Throughout this challenging period we've consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver world-class programming on all of our platforms, digital and linear. On ABC, we continue to have the number one returning drama in the key demo of adults 18 to 49 with Grey's Anatomy as well as the top new drama of the fall Big Sky. Both Grey's and Big Sky also hold the top broadcast drama spots on Hulu. Also of note, ESPN's first ever NFL Wild Card MegaCast featured six networks including ABC, ESPN+ and ESPN Deportes. It was the most extensive multichannel offering to date for an NFL playoff game. In the following day, the team at ESPN pulled off an equally impressive seat with a MegaCast of the college football playoff national championship game with 14 different presentations on multiple platforms. During an extraordinarily difficult year, our amazing local and national ABC News teams have been doing an absolutely outstanding job. And Good Morning America and World News Tonight with David Muir continue to hold the top spot as the number one morning show and evening newscast. While these remain challenging times, we are more confident than ever that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position. We're proud of all that we've accomplished, especially as it relates to our top priority our DTC business and we believe that the strategic actions we're taking to transform our company will enable us to enhance the consumer and guest experience, grow and expand our businesses and increase shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn it over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter were $0.32. In spite of the challenging circumstances we have faced with COVID over the past year, these results reflect the strength of our brands and experiences as well as our ongoing commitment to operate our businesses efficiently. This is the first quarter in which we are reporting under our new organizational structure. We filed an 8-K last week with the summary recast segment financial information for fiscal 2020. Today's discussion of our financial results will be organized by two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution or DMED; and Disney Parks Experiences and Products or DPEP. I'll start with our newest segment DMED where operating income increased modestly in the first quarter versus the prior year. Our financial reporting structure for DMED includes three lines of business: Linear networks; direct-to-consumer; and content sales licensing and other. Operating income at linear networks, which now includes both domestic and international channels decreased versus the prior year quarter due to declines both domestically and internationally. At our domestic channels, the decline in operating income was due to lower results at our cable business partially offset by an increase at our broadcasting business. The decrease at cable was largely driven by ESPN where results in the first quarter were significantly impacted by higher rights costs. This was largely due to timing of College Football Playoff games relative to our fiscal periods as well as higher NBA programming costs. The first quarter included 6 CFP bowl games compared to 3 in the prior year quarter. Four NBA finals games were played in the first quarter due to COVID-related timing shifts whereas these games would have typically occurred in the prior fiscal year. ESPN domestic advertising revenue decreased 4% in the quarter due to lower average viewership and the cancellation of certain college sporting events partially offset by an increase in rates. Ad revenue at ESPN is currently pacing down quarter-to-date due in part to the timing of key events. At broadcasting, higher political advertising revenue at our owned television stations drove an increase in operating results versus the prior year, partially offset by a decrease at the ABC television network. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 3% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates offset by a 5-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. At our international channels, lower results in the quarter were driven by higher programming and production costs and lower affiliate revenue, partially offset by advertising revenue growth and a reduction in non-programming costs. Higher programming costs and higher advertising revenue reflected a shift in the timing of Indian Premier League cricket matches due to COVID. And the decrease in affiliate revenue was primarily due to channel closures.  However, our international channels results this past quarter were better than the guidance we gave in our last earnings call, primarily due to stronger-than-expected advertising revenue, COVID-related timing shifts of non-cricket programming and sports rights costs and expense savings.  Moving on to direct-to-consumer. Improved results at all three of our streaming services drove an improvement in direct-to-consumer operating results of nearly $650 million versus the prior year.  Last quarter, we guided to direct-to-consumer operating income declining by $100 million versus the prior year under our former segment structure. Our reported results are $750 million higher than that guidance.  While some of the outperformance reflects better-than-expected results from Hulu and Disney+ the majority of the variance relates to the elimination of intersegment pricing markups under our new financial reporting structure.  At Hulu, the improvement in the first quarter versus the prior year was due to both subscriber and advertising revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. Hulu ended the first quarter with 39.4 million paid subscribers including four million Hulu live digital MVPD subscribers.  Turning to Disney+, a lower loss in the first quarter compared to the prior year was driven by subscriber growth partially offset by higher costs due to the launch and expansion of Disney+. With 94.9 million paid subscribers at the end of Q1, Disney+'s global net additions were 21.2 million versus Q4.  Disney+ Hotstar subscriber additions continued their strong growth trend with Disney+ Hotstar subscribers making up approximately 30% of our global subscriber base. We also saw strong additions to our subscriber base from our November launch in Latin America.  Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.03. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar it was $5.37. Higher results at ESPN+ were driven by subscriber growth partially offset by higher sports programming costs driven by soccer rights. ESPN+ ended the quarter with 12.1 million paid subscribers.  Given that we are past the launch year of Disney+, we no longer intend to update our DTC subscriber numbers as of our earnings dates. But we will continue to provide you with quarter end subs. We may choose to make additional disclosures when we hit certain milestones.  Content, sales, licensing and other operating income at DMED decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year due to lower theatrical TV SVOD and home entertainment results all consistent with our prior guidance. The decrease in theatrical results reflects no significant worldwide releases in the quarter compared to Frozen 2 in the prior year quarter.  Lower TV SVOD distribution results were the result of a shift from licensing to third parties to exhibiting our content on our DTC services. A decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in the quarter compared to the performance of Toy Story 4, The Lion King and Aladdin in the prior year quarter.  I'll now turn to our Parks Experiences and Products segment. We continue to see significant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic across many of our businesses. While some operations have resumed our Parks Experiences and Products segment has undoubtedly been hard hit by COVID.  In the first fiscal quarter, we estimate the pandemic adversely impacted DPEP operating income by approximately $2.6 billion due to revenues lost as a result of closures and reduced operating capacities. Operating income at Parks Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of $119 million. As a reminder, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for all of the first quarter. Disneyland Resort was closed and our cruise business was suspended for the full quarter. Disneyland Paris was opened until the end of October or for about a third of the quarter and Hong Kong Disneyland was open until the beginning of December or for about two-thirds of the quarter. Our parks and resorts that were opened during the quarter all operated at significantly reduced capacities, yet all achieved a net incremental positive contribution for the periods during which they were open, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. At Walt Disney World, as Bob mentioned earlier, average daily attendance grew significantly from Q4 into Q1, benefiting from typical seasonality factors as well as solid underlying demand trends. At the same time, our operations team found innovative ways to responsibly increase capacity, while still maintaining rigorous COVID protocols. Per caps were also up double-digits year-over-year. We continue to be pleased with the rate of reservation bookings we are seeing in the current quarter and consumer sentiment around visiting our domestic theme parks over a longer period of time remains strong. At our consumer products business, we saw an increase in operating income in the first quarter, driven by an increase in games licensing revenue, which reflects the successful release of Marvel's latest licensed Spider-Man game. As we look ahead, despite continued limited visibility due to the challenges of the pandemic, we would like to give you some context around certain items that may impact our second quarter or full year results. First, at our domestic linear networks, we expect ESPN will benefit in the second quarter from the timing of college football and other sporting events with lower rights costs being partially offset by lower advertising revenue. In Q2, we had only one CFP game which was the National Championship game. This compares to four games in the prior year; three CFP Bowl games and the National Championship game. Our broadcasting business will be negatively impacted in the second quarter due to lower political advertising versus the prior year, in addition to the shift of The Academy Awards to the third quarter. We expect direct-to-consumer operating results in the second quarter to improve modestly versus the prior year quarter as improvement at Hulu and ESPN+ will be partially offset by increased content investment to support the expansion of Disney+. We expect that Walt Disney world attendance in the second quarter will be impacted by typical seasonality headwinds in addition to continued COVID-related headwinds and capacity constraints. Our current expectation is that Disneyland and Disneyland Paris will be closed for the entirety of the second quarter, but we are hopeful we will be able to reopen Hong Kong Disneyland during the quarter. We have refined our capital spending expectations and we now expect CapEx in fiscal year 2021 to be roughly comparable to fiscal 2020 spending. Compared to 2020 we still expect to see increased investment at DMED, in corporate, and reduced spending at DPEP. And with that, I'll now hand the call over to Lowell and we will be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Christine, thank you. And we're ready to transition to the Q&A. And as we do that, let me note that since we are once again not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the call by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. So, with that Liz, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. Bob can you -- I know visibility is limited, but can you tell us how you think about the parks through the rest of this year? In particular, Christine mentioned strong underlying demand. But do you expect to be able to increase capacity limits and fulfil that demand? And as you do, are there things that you've done on the technology or cost side that can help us think about the ramp back to breakeven? And then I was just wondering Christine, is there any way for you to help us think about the sports rights in fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020. There's been so much movement in a number of games between the two years. And obviously, these are big dollars for the company. I'm just wondering if there's any way you can help us think about that, maybe on an annual basis. Thank you, both.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Ben. Thank you. So Bob, why don't you take the first question about parks and then we'll go to Christine on sports rights.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the outlook for the parks for the rest of the year and the capacity, it's really going to be determined by the rate of vaccination of the public. That to us seems like the biggest lever that we can have in order to either take the parks that are currently under limited capacity and increase it or open up parks that are currently closed. So that is sort of the gating factor if you will. As Christine suggested, we have ample demand for our parks. Despite everything that's happening with that pandemic, I think we've made a pretty big impression on our consumer base and prospective guests in terms of the safety measures that we've undertaken at our parks to give assurances to people that they should come in and bring their families. And we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of future bookings. In terms of the cost savings and the technical side of things, not only has our industrial engineering team at Walt Disney World and some of our parks like Shanghai across the world figured out ways to have increased capacity with the same safety measures that we've had in place, which has enabled us to increase our, if you will, our attendance. But there we have been able to substantially manage our cost side at the same time to right-size, if you will, our -- not only our fixed cost base, but also our variable cost base to match what's happening. And I think that's evidenced by what Christine said that all of our parks, regardless of what conditions they're operating under, assuming they are operating, are in positive net contribution side. I would also add you didn't mention this, but I think it's important to add that given those per caps that Christine referenced in terms of the double-digit increase in per caps, this is sort of the ultimate situation where demand has exceeded supply. We've had that -- been fortunate enough to have that situation for the last couple of years and we've learned how to yield this business. And I think this is the ultimate situation where we've got supply greater than demand. So not only working on the cost side, but we're also working on the revenue side. And I think you see some of those results at play at Walt Disney World.\nBen Swinburne: Got it.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Hi, Ben. Now to address sports rights and the shifting between fiscal years, because of what happened with not only cancellations but delays of some of the sporting events, you will see some doubling up of some sports rights in this fiscal year. Things like you'll have two NBA finals, assuming the season for 2021 continues as we expect. You'll also have things like two Masters, two seasons of IPL games. And this all assumes that in fiscal 2021 nothing is drastically shifted out. But you can expect the sports rights overall to be up, because of the doubling and the shifting into fiscal 2021. And that's on linear. When we look at our ESPN+ rights costs, those are up also because we acquired some additional rights, most significantly in soccer that we announced earlier last year.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you, both.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Ben. Thanks for the question. Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I have two all. One is on DTC and the learnings from Soul being released directly versus what you experienced in Mulan. Any takeaways there? And maybe what's the right model for you? And then secondly on Hotstar, how important has cricket been to the growth in the adoption there? And is there a risk of churn when the IPL season comes to an end? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. So, Bob, do you want to take the Soul question? And then, Christine, you might want to take the Hotstar question.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the DTC business and Soul, as you remember, we took it out on Christmas Day, we thought that was a really nice thing to do for our consumer base and our subscriber base, given the holiday and given the fact that we have talked consistently about remaining flexible in terms of how we're going to go ahead and put our titles out into the marketplace. We were absolutely thrilled by what that brought to our business in terms of both acquisition and retention. And so, I would say, it was a big hit with our subscriber base. In terms of Mulan, I think the best thing I can say about Mulan is that it was successful to the extent that we're also using that strategy on Raya. So the individual decisions that we talked about in the future, in some films we'll take them theatrically and in some films we'll take them theatrically, plus Disney Premier Access as is the case with Raya and was the case with Mulan. And in some cases, we'll take it direct to service. It's going to be dependent, though, on what our slate of titles are and whether we think that we need to put something on the service for those particular guests, or whether this is something that we could use as another data point in our exploration of Premier Access [indiscernible] date with theatrical. So it's really about flexibility and we're going to steer our decision-making over time, given what information that we get from our guests and our subscriber base on what they prefer.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. And can I just follow-up for a quick second, on Black Widow, which is still I think a May release date? Anything you want to share on potential changes to that release date?\nBob Chapek: Right. So I'm going to go back to the word flexibility, because we had made a reference at the investor conference that Black Widow was going to be a theatrical release and we are still intending it to be a theatrical release. But, again, we are going to be watching very carefully the reopening of theatres and the consumer sentiment in terms of desire to go back to theatres, to see whether that strategy needs to be revisited. But as of now the strategy is to continue on with the theatrical release and we'll be watching very, very carefully. \nMichael Nathanson: Okay. Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. And I'm going to address the question regarding churn on Disney+ Hotstar, with the IPL season finishing up. So just to put it in context, cricket is a very important part of a diversified programming strategy at Disney+ Hotstar. It also has a lot of other local content that consumers like to view. So we did see a bump up when the IPL season started. But we've also made it economical for a consumer to sign up for a one-year subscription versus going month-to-month. So those are some of the things that we're looking at and utilizing to mitigate the churn that one could expect from IPL, but it's a more diversified offering in terms of programming than just cricket.\nMichael Nathanson: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: All right. Michael, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Just sort of following up on those comments. On Disney+, can you please discuss, maybe, in general, how you are thinking about local partnerships for content versus more traditional Disney content? I believe, in Indonesia, you leaned a lot more into local content partnerships and you saw outsized growth in that launch there. And I'm curious, sort of, maybe some broader commentary about that mix going forward? And then, my second question is, just sort of following up on your comments on churn. Not necessarily looking obviously for a number on churn, but maybe just some colour about churn in general for Disney+? And how we should think about it in front of the upcoming price increase?\nLowell Singer: Okay. Alexia, thanks. So, Bob, do you want to talk a little bit about local partnership? And then, Christine, you can talk a little bit about churn.\nBob Chapek: Okay. So in terms of the local partnership -- well, first, I'm going to talk about -- I'll talk about the content side, because there was a content side element of it as well. There's really two things that gate our amount of content that's local in any given market, including Indonesia. And in some cases there are local requirements for local content, as a percentage of the total. So that is one factor that plays into it. And then, second one is what we think we need from a portfolio standpoint of overall content. And as you might suspect, we're pretty aggressively ramping up all of our production for all our local territories. In terms of the partnerships, in Indonesia, we're partnering with Telkomsel and we have a lot of data plan and promotional bundling that we're doing with them which not only is, sort of, keeping the rates at a place that's respectable in the marketplace given the overall economy there and what the market will bear, but also is giving us exposure possibly from a marketing standpoint and promotional standpoint to particular audience segments that we may not otherwise be able to get. So -- and in terms of overall churn are you going to take that one Christine? \nLowell Singer: Yes. Christine will. \nChristine McCarthy: Yes. So in general, we are very pleased with what we've seen so far on the level of churn. And as our product offering matures and we put more content into the service and our subscriber base becomes more tenured, we expect to see our churn rates continue to decline. So in regard to the specific churn related to the anniversary of the Verizon launch promotion from last November 2020, we're really happy with the conversion numbers that we have seen there going from the promotion to become paid subscribers. We also have that price increase that consumers know about and they're expecting. But we're very comfortable with the price-value relationship that we're offering. So we think that the $1 increase will be well-received. And we believe that our current and future pricing offers attractive value to consumers. So we feel really good about where we are but we always want to improve. \nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Alexia. Thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. \nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks. Maybe first on the parks, I mean, given the cost reductions and the efficiencies, can we expect longer-term margins in that segment to be higher once we get back to full capacity? And then maybe a quick one on the CapEx guidance. It looks like I think you guys revised guidance for CapEx. It was I think about $0.5 billion higher on a year-over-year basis. Can you just run through the items that keep it flat on a year-over-year basis? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. John, sure. Thanks for those questions. Bob do you want to talk a little bit about parks? And then Christine you can talk a little bit about CapEx.\nBob Chapek: I would characterize this last year as being not only a year of challenge, but also a year of learning in terms of what we can do, in terms of sustained margin growth in our parks. I say that because there's nothing like a pandemic to challenge the status quo and make you be fairly introspective about a lot of things that you've maybe taken as fairly dogmatic. I think you've all seen several new announcements about things that we've done recently that may have been heresy prior to the pandemic like recasting of our annual pass program at Disneyland and reconsidering the overwhelming demand we have relative to supply. Everything we do the first lens we look at is to exceed guest expectations. And it's very tough when your park has more demand than supply, we have to put limits on it. Well as you know, we have a wide variety of margins depending on the nature of the guest and how they visit and when they visit. So with a lens towards maximizing the guest experience, we are now able to essentially reset many pieces of our business both on the cost and revenue side of the business in order to say, if we had a blank piece of paper how would we set up our parks business and be a little bit more aggressive than we typically might be able to be without the impetus of unfortunately a year-long closure. So we've had a lot of time to think particularly, at Disneyland about what could be and I think you're about to see some of those strategies be born. \nChristine McCarthy: Okay. And before I talk about CapEx, I just want to say from my perspective the Parks management team has done an outstanding job addressing cost structure. Of course, variable costs will come back in as we ramp-up operations, but they've really looked at the way they're doing business and it's really been quite impressive. So I just want to add that to what Bob has already said. As it relates to CapEx, last earnings call we had said that we expected CapEx to be up from last year. I think the number was $550 million. But now we're expecting it to be relatively flat. We have here is a couple of dynamics. We'll have increased spending at DMED and corporate, but we're going to have reduced spending at Parks. Some of the DMED spending is going to be on things like technology, in infrastructure investments related to the launch of Star and DPEP at our Parks business. Obviously, the reason that the CapEx is slowing is because some of the parks are closed and we've chosen to slow spending there.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nLowell Singer: John, thanks for the question. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. \nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Given the viewership of Super Bowl, this year on CBS was down and it's fairly low for the last 10 years and streaming was up a lot. Can you talk about how you think about that in light of ESPN+? Like how does that factor into your conversations with the NFL? And then maybe kind of related, but how much of a factor is sports betting in these conversations? And in general how will you leverage both ESPN and ABC to capitalize on the growing legalization and adoption of sports betting. And then just back to Parks for one second, can you talk about how attendance relates to capacity? I mean you only add capacity a few days a year. So is there any way you can frame that relationship. If you allow 35% capacity is that I don't know 70% of attendance?\nLowell Singer: Okay. So Jessica I'm going to let Bob take the sports question and maybe Christine will start with the Parks question. But Bob I'll turn it over to you.\nBob Chapek: Okay. So I'll take the sports. ESPN is always a consideration whenever we look at rights going forward. In terms of the Super Bowl being down and as we're going into rights conversations with them that's obviously, something we're considering but more important than any one Super Bowl we're looking at the long-term trends of sports viewership, the MVPD universe and our own prospects of potentially a more true ESPN DTC service. So there's a lot of moving parts and a lot of elements in that mix but it's all taking into account the trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. What I will say is that we've had a long relationship with the NFL and if we have a deal, if there is a deal that will be accretive to shareholder value, we will certainly entertain that and look at that. But our first filter will be whether it makes sense for our shareholder standpoint going forward. In terms of sports betting. As you probably know we already have some programming on ESPN around the subject of sports betting. It particularly is attractive to the younger, very passionate sports audience that we find. So it's an important piece of what we're doing. We've got relationships with DraftKings and Caesars. We've got sports links with -- sports betting links with both of those, not branded Disney or ESPN obviously. But branded through their own offerings. We've got a studio in Las Vegas with Caesars that we're working on. And we've also got a variety of different things that we're entertaining for the future. So sports betting we do realize the value in that. We've obviously got some bumpers in terms of our own brand and what we think our own elasticity is in terms of us participating in such endeavors. But we're highly interested in taking the relationships that we have with both parties and taking them to the next level if that makes sense.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Jessica. I'll address your question about capacity at the parks. You're absolutely right, there are days. Especially holiday periods where we have to shut our parks for additional entries. Those tend to be days that the park fills up quickly and we just can't accommodate more people. But that being said. We are currently operating at 35% of that full capacity. And the teams in the park, especially at Walt Disney World have really figured out a way to be as efficient as possible in operating the park that allows us to get up to that 35% and still maintain all of the protocols for social distancing for COVID. The -- I think you'll remember, when we started opening, we started at a level less than 35% but it was the -- as Bob has already mentioned, industrial engineering that we utilize and just moving people around. The other thing I'd say is, when you think about the parks, it's a combination of attendance and per caps when you're looking at revenue. As we've -- as I said in my comments and I think Bob's alluded to it on the Q&A that we've had really nice growth in per caps. It was double digits not only on a linked-quarter basis from fourth quarter to first quarter, but also double digits year-over-year. So when you think about per caps and the yield management we want to have people have a great time when they're in our parks. And when they have a good time, they tend to spend more money. So this is something that we're refining as we go along.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Great. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Jessica thanks for the question. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Good afternoon. So back to streaming, I think at your first Disney+ Analyst Day you indicated that you'd be launched to the full world by about the end of this fiscal year or calendar year. I think it was fiscal year. So I'm just curious, if the timing for rest of world launches for Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar is on track to be completed over the next few quarters? And I'm also interested, if you have any comments on engagement for Disney+. And I'm thinking, just how customers that have been on the service a little bit longer do they still use the service as much as when they first joined? How was Mandalorian and WandaVision in terms of being watched in as many homes as you hoped? And I guess, a third piece of that would be any comments on cadence around the content slate going forward? I know, at the Analyst Day, you talked about getting to 100 shows a year, should we think about content continuing to ramp aggressively in the coming months or coming quarters? How should we think about that? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: So, Bob why don't you take these -- the streaming rollout question? And then Christine maybe you could take the engagement question and Bob will go back to you on cadence of content cycle.\nBob Chapek: Okay. Yes, we are still on schedule, where we will get to the great majority of our rollout markets by the end of the year. It's all green lights in terms of our launch not only in terms of preparation of the service itself and being able to handle it from a delivery standpoint, but also from a content curation standpoint both creation and acquisition again on the local content when we need that. As you know, we've got quite a slew of new content coming and great library of content, which really rounds out our offering and we'll add to that our local offerings in order to make it a fully robust offering for each particular market given the idiosyncrasies of what each market requires. So, it's all as planned.\nChristine McCarthy: So Doug on engagement, as we said at the Investor Day, with Disney+ originals along with the theatrical releases and the library titles, we'll be adding something new to the service every week. And in general, I would say, we are very pleased with the engagement overall, especially when we put something like WandaVision on the service. So once again, these -- any time we put a new piece of content on the engagement for people, who know what the schedule of releases is it's quite encouraging. So we believe we're going to reach that cadence of getting content on the service every week within the next few years. We've also set that target for 100-plus new titles per year. And that's across Disney Animation, Disney Live Action, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Nat Geo. And of course, we'll continue to add more to our library as we go through time as well.\nDoug Mitchelson: Great. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Christine. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: Thanks. I just have a question on parks. Since the vaccine came out last year, the buy side has this soft expectation that anyone that saw a revenue downturn because of COVID will get back to 2019 revenues by 2022, once we have herd immunity and the vaccines distributed. And every once in a while, I read some article that suggests that social distancing will still have to be in place even when herd immunity is around and people will still have to wear masks. So, do you guys have any counsel or insight in terms of how you're thinking about sort of how the parks will operate by the time we get to 2022? And any reason, not to believe that we won't sort of get back to 2019 revenues assuming that the economy is fine and all that? \nLowell Singer: Thanks Jason. I'm going to turn that over to Bob. \nBob Chapek: Yes. I won't specifically comment on whether we anticipate getting to 2019 revenues by 2022, but I will tell you what our expectations are in terms of the state of the world by then. We have no doubt that when we reopen up in parks that were closed or increase the capacity that we'll have some level of social distancing and mask wearing for the remainder of this year. That's our expectation. But I believe that Dr. Fauci said earlier today that, he hopes that there's vaccines for everyone who wants them by April this year. If that happens that is a game changer. And that could accelerate our expectations and give people the confidence that they need to come back to the parks. Will there be some overlap until we know that we've hit herd immunity? Sure there will. But do we also believe that we'll be in the same state of 6-foot social distancing and mask wearing in '22? Absolutely not. \nJason Bazinet: Thank you.\nBob Chapek: Hey thanks Jason. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. \nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. So if I go back to the December Analyst Day, you had outlined an expectation that Disney+ would see peak operating losses in this fiscal year and achieve profitability by fiscal year '24. When we look at the DTC P&L in the quarter you just reported in your outlook, it seems like you're trending much better than that for this fiscal year. So I'm curious do we need to revisit any of this guidance either because of accounting changes related to the resegmentation or maybe just underlying operating trends that are perhaps better than you had expected? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Brett thank you for the question. I'm going to turn that one over to Christine. \nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Thanks Brett. You're absolutely right. Peak losses we expect in this fiscal year. We said at our Investor Day which wasn't too long ago that we expected to reach profitability in fiscal 2024. We're not going to change that at this point although we are very pleased with the results that we just announced. But we are also -- given the value of growing our sub base, we are continuing to invest in high-quality content. We believe that content is the single biggest driver to not only acquiring subs, but retaining them. We're also going to have some other cost drivers that we just have to factor into our timing for profitability and that includes marketing, technology, customer service and just other expenses of running a new business. So we're sticking to that 2024 -- fiscal 2024 profitability. But once again we're very pleased with where we are today.\nBrett Feldman: If you wouldn't mind if I guess ask a quick follow-up question. You've gotten the question about whether you see any churn risk around the rate adjustments that are going to be coming this year. Are you expecting maybe to spend a bit more around engagement or awareness or marketing or anything just to make sure that as you transition out of the launch phase and promotional period phases and into your first ever rate adjustment that your customer base feels connected with you and that you don't experience that speed bump? \nChristine McCarthy: We believe that keeping subscribers informed about what's on the service is extremely important. So the awareness that we'll create through targeted marketing and marketing of the brand will basically mitigate what we believe is a very reasonable price increase given the amount of content and the value to subscribers. \nRob Chapek: Yes Christine if I can just jump in here as well. We believe that we've got a great price-value relationship. I mean think about it from a Star Wars franchise, we moved from Mando 2 to Boba Fett later on this year to Mandalorian 3. And on a Marvel standpoint we go from WandaVision to Falcon and the Winter Soldier and to Loki. So I think the best insulation we've got is to keep the price-value relationship very high and there's no better way to do it than powerhouse franchises cranking out regular new releases on a monthly basis. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Operator we have time for one more question. \nOperator: This question comes from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim.\nMichael Morris: Thank you, guys. Good afternoon. A couple of questions on streaming. First, I want to ask you about Hulu, the SVOD service on Hulu. Hoping you can maybe share a little bit about the dynamic that's going on there, what the mix of sort of ad-supported versus ad-free subscriber base looks like. And there are a number of these now free ad-supported streaming services that have been growing and being more aggressively populated. I'm curious, how you see that competitive dynamic playing out? And I want to ask one question about sports. Bob, you mentioned the MegaCast approach to a couple of your big events. And I'm curious, as you look at your ability to provide that, what's the economic benefit to you? Do you -- is this primarily about putting it in front of more people, and therefore being able to monetize better? Or, is there an element of your ability to deliver a MegaCast, when you were negotiating for content rights, sports rights, with the leagues or teams, the owners there that you have a somewhat stronger negotiating position relative to your peers? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay Mike. It's good to hear from you. I'm going to let, Christine take the Hulu SVOD question. And then, I'll ask Bob to address the MegaCast question.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Mike. So on Hulu SVOD, when you look at the relative mix of ad-supported versus ad-free more of the subscribers are in the ad-free -- ad-supported. And that is where we have seen the really nice growth of our addressable advertising. So, that -- we're very comfortable and we actually -- we like the mix that we have, but it is more ad-supported, so we enjoy that relative increase of advertising. But it's pretty much been the track record that Hulu has of having that relationship of ad-supported versus ad-free has been relatively consistent, over their 10-year tenure.\nBob Chapek: Yes. And on a multicast question, I think it's both, both elements. So I think there's a consumer benefit to the fact that nobody else, could do what ESPN does in terms of the multicast. And I think we've proven that in several different ways, over the last few months with big football events being broadcast. But I think there's also an element that, that then, is obvious not only to us and obvious to our consumers, but obvious to our prospective partners, as we go into negotiations of new deals. I think there's probably a, mentality that well the more times we divide this up, the better off we're going to be, from the prospective rights owners. And I think what we're doing is throwing a wrench into that thinking. And suggesting that, maybe by taking a consumer-first approach and saying, boy, consumer choice is really a good thing for everybody, let's go ahead and maximize the number of touch points we have, not only do we get a benefit from our subscriber base for those folks that have ESPN, but I think it's also very apparent to the leagues who hold the rights.\nMichael Morris: Great. Thank you, Bob.\nLowell Singer: Mike, thank you. And thanks again everyone for joining us today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter were $0.32. In spite of the challenging circumstances we have faced with COVID over the past year, these results reflect the strength of our brands and experiences as well as our ongoing commitment to operate our businesses efficiently. This is the first quarter in which we are reporting under our new organizational structure. We filed an 8-K last week with the summary recast segment financial information for fiscal 2020. Today's discussion of our financial results will be organized by two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution or DMED; and Disney Parks Experiences and Products or DPEP. I'll start with our newest segment DMED where operating income increased modestly in the first quarter versus the prior year. Our financial reporting structure for DMED includes three lines of business: Linear networks; direct-to-consumer; and content sales licensing and other. Operating income at linear networks, which now includes both domestic and international channels decreased versus the prior year quarter due to declines both domestically and internationally. At our domestic channels, the decline in operating income was due to lower results at our cable business partially offset by an increase at our broadcasting business. The decrease at cable was largely driven by ESPN where results in the first quarter were significantly impacted by higher rights costs. This was largely due to timing of College Football Playoff games relative to our fiscal periods as well as higher NBA programming costs. The first quarter included 6 CFP bowl games compared to 3 in the prior year quarter. Four NBA finals games were played in the first quarter due to COVID-related timing shifts whereas these games would have typically occurred in the prior fiscal year. ESPN domestic advertising revenue decreased 4% in the quarter due to lower average viewership and the cancellation of certain college sporting events partially offset by an increase in rates. Ad revenue at ESPN is currently pacing down quarter-to-date due in part to the timing of key events. At broadcasting, higher political advertising revenue at our owned television stations drove an increase in operating results versus the prior year, partially offset by a decrease at the ABC television network. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 3% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates offset by a 5-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. At our international channels, lower results in the quarter were driven by higher programming and production costs and lower affiliate revenue, partially offset by advertising revenue growth and a reduction in non-programming costs. Higher programming costs and higher advertising revenue reflected a shift in the timing of Indian Premier League cricket matches due to COVID. And the decrease in affiliate revenue was primarily due to channel closures.  However, our international channels results this past quarter were better than the guidance we gave in our last earnings call, primarily due to stronger-than-expected advertising revenue, COVID-related timing shifts of non-cricket programming and sports rights costs and expense savings.  Moving on to direct-to-consumer. Improved results at all three of our streaming services drove an improvement in direct-to-consumer operating results of nearly $650 million versus the prior year.  Last quarter, we guided to direct-to-consumer operating income declining by $100 million versus the prior year under our former segment structure. Our reported results are $750 million higher than that guidance.  While some of the outperformance reflects better-than-expected results from Hulu and Disney+ the majority of the variance relates to the elimination of intersegment pricing markups under our new financial reporting structure.  At Hulu, the improvement in the first quarter versus the prior year was due to both subscriber and advertising revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. Hulu ended the first quarter with 39.4 million paid subscribers including four million Hulu live digital MVPD subscribers.  Turning to Disney+, a lower loss in the first quarter compared to the prior year was driven by subscriber growth partially offset by higher costs due to the launch and expansion of Disney+. With 94.9 million paid subscribers at the end of Q1, Disney+'s global net additions were 21.2 million versus Q4.  Disney+ Hotstar subscriber additions continued their strong growth trend with Disney+ Hotstar subscribers making up approximately 30% of our global subscriber base. We also saw strong additions to our subscriber base from our November launch in Latin America.  Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.03. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar it was $5.37. Higher results at ESPN+ were driven by subscriber growth partially offset by higher sports programming costs driven by soccer rights. ESPN+ ended the quarter with 12.1 million paid subscribers.  Given that we are past the launch year of Disney+, we no longer intend to update our DTC subscriber numbers as of our earnings dates. But we will continue to provide you with quarter end subs. We may choose to make additional disclosures when we hit certain milestones.  Content, sales, licensing and other operating income at DMED decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year due to lower theatrical TV SVOD and home entertainment results all consistent with our prior guidance. The decrease in theatrical results reflects no significant worldwide releases in the quarter compared to Frozen 2 in the prior year quarter.  Lower TV SVOD distribution results were the result of a shift from licensing to third parties to exhibiting our content on our DTC services. A decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in the quarter compared to the performance of Toy Story 4, The Lion King and Aladdin in the prior year quarter.  I'll now turn to our Parks Experiences and Products segment. We continue to see significant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic across many of our businesses. While some operations have resumed our Parks Experiences and Products segment has undoubtedly been hard hit by COVID.  In the first fiscal quarter, we estimate the pandemic adversely impacted DPEP operating income by approximately $2.6 billion due to revenues lost as a result of closures and reduced operating capacities. Operating income at Parks Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of $119 million. As a reminder, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for all of the first quarter. Disneyland Resort was closed and our cruise business was suspended for the full quarter. Disneyland Paris was opened until the end of October or for about a third of the quarter and Hong Kong Disneyland was open until the beginning of December or for about two-thirds of the quarter. Our parks and resorts that were opened during the quarter all operated at significantly reduced capacities, yet all achieved a net incremental positive contribution for the periods during which they were open, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. At Walt Disney World, as Bob mentioned earlier, average daily attendance grew significantly from Q4 into Q1, benefiting from typical seasonality factors as well as solid underlying demand trends. At the same time, our operations team found innovative ways to responsibly increase capacity, while still maintaining rigorous COVID protocols. Per caps were also up double-digits year-over-year. We continue to be pleased with the rate of reservation bookings we are seeing in the current quarter and consumer sentiment around visiting our domestic theme parks over a longer period of time remains strong. At our consumer products business, we saw an increase in operating income in the first quarter, driven by an increase in games licensing revenue, which reflects the successful release of Marvel's latest licensed Spider-Man game. As we look ahead, despite continued limited visibility due to the challenges of the pandemic, we would like to give you some context around certain items that may impact our second quarter or full year results. First, at our domestic linear networks, we expect ESPN will benefit in the second quarter from the timing of college football and other sporting events with lower rights costs being partially offset by lower advertising revenue. In Q2, we had only one CFP game which was the National Championship game. This compares to four games in the prior year; three CFP Bowl games and the National Championship game. Our broadcasting business will be negatively impacted in the second quarter due to lower political advertising versus the prior year, in addition to the shift of The Academy Awards to the third quarter. We expect direct-to-consumer operating results in the second quarter to improve modestly versus the prior year quarter as improvement at Hulu and ESPN+ will be partially offset by increased content investment to support the expansion of Disney+. We expect that Walt Disney world attendance in the second quarter will be impacted by typical seasonality headwinds in addition to continued COVID-related headwinds and capacity constraints. Our current expectation is that Disneyland and Disneyland Paris will be closed for the entirety of the second quarter, but we are hopeful we will be able to reopen Hong Kong Disneyland during the quarter. We have refined our capital spending expectations and we now expect CapEx in fiscal year 2021 to be roughly comparable to fiscal 2020 spending. Compared to 2020 we still expect to see increased investment at DMED, in corporate, and reduced spending at DPEP. And with that, I'll now hand the call over to Lowell and we will be happy to take your questions. Okay. Hi, Ben. Now to address sports rights and the shifting between fiscal years, because of what happened with not only cancellations but delays of some of the sporting events, you will see some doubling up of some sports rights in this fiscal year. Things like you'll have two NBA finals, assuming the season for 2021 continues as we expect. You'll also have things like two Masters, two seasons of IPL games. And this all assumes that in fiscal 2021 nothing is drastically shifted out. But you can expect the sports rights overall to be up, because of the doubling and the shifting into fiscal 2021. And that's on linear. When we look at our ESPN+ rights costs, those are up also because we acquired some additional rights, most significantly in soccer that we announced earlier last year. Okay. And I'm going to address the question regarding churn on Disney+ Hotstar, with the IPL season finishing up. So just to put it in context, cricket is a very important part of a diversified programming strategy at Disney+ Hotstar. It also has a lot of other local content that consumers like to view. So we did see a bump up when the IPL season started. But we've also made it economical for a consumer to sign up for a one-year subscription versus going month-to-month. So those are some of the things that we're looking at and utilizing to mitigate the churn that one could expect from IPL, but it's a more diversified offering in terms of programming than just cricket. Yes. So in general, we are very pleased with what we've seen so far on the level of churn. And as our product offering matures and we put more content into the service and our subscriber base becomes more tenured, we expect to see our churn rates continue to decline. So in regard to the specific churn related to the anniversary of the Verizon launch promotion from last November 2020, we're really happy with the conversion numbers that we have seen there going from the promotion to become paid subscribers. We also have that price increase that consumers know about and they're expecting. But we're very comfortable with the price-value relationship that we're offering. So we think that the $1 increase will be well-received. And we believe that our current and future pricing offers attractive value to consumers. So we feel really good about where we are but we always want to improve. Okay. And before I talk about CapEx, I just want to say from my perspective the Parks management team has done an outstanding job addressing cost structure. Of course, variable costs will come back in as we ramp-up operations, but they've really looked at the way they're doing business and it's really been quite impressive. So I just want to add that to what Bob has already said. As it relates to CapEx, last earnings call we had said that we expected CapEx to be up from last year. I think the number was $550 million. But now we're expecting it to be relatively flat. We have here is a couple of dynamics. We'll have increased spending at DMED and corporate, but we're going to have reduced spending at Parks. Some of the DMED spending is going to be on things like technology, in infrastructure investments related to the launch of Star and DPEP at our Parks business. Obviously, the reason that the CapEx is slowing is because some of the parks are closed and we've chosen to slow spending there. Okay. Jessica. I'll address your question about capacity at the parks. You're absolutely right, there are days. Especially holiday periods where we have to shut our parks for additional entries. Those tend to be days that the park fills up quickly and we just can't accommodate more people. But that being said. We are currently operating at 35% of that full capacity. And the teams in the park, especially at Walt Disney World have really figured out a way to be as efficient as possible in operating the park that allows us to get up to that 35% and still maintain all of the protocols for social distancing for COVID. The -- I think you'll remember, when we started opening, we started at a level less than 35% but it was the -- as Bob has already mentioned, industrial engineering that we utilize and just moving people around. The other thing I'd say is, when you think about the parks, it's a combination of attendance and per caps when you're looking at revenue. As we've -- as I said in my comments and I think Bob's alluded to it on the Q&A that we've had really nice growth in per caps. It was double digits not only on a linked-quarter basis from fourth quarter to first quarter, but also double digits year-over-year. So when you think about per caps and the yield management we want to have people have a great time when they're in our parks. And when they have a good time, they tend to spend more money. So this is something that we're refining as we go along. So Doug on engagement, as we said at the Investor Day, with Disney+ originals along with the theatrical releases and the library titles, we'll be adding something new to the service every week. And in general, I would say, we are very pleased with the engagement overall, especially when we put something like WandaVision on the service. So once again, these -- any time we put a new piece of content on the engagement for people, who know what the schedule of releases is it's quite encouraging. So we believe we're going to reach that cadence of getting content on the service every week within the next few years. We've also set that target for 100-plus new titles per year. And that's across Disney Animation, Disney Live Action, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Nat Geo. And of course, we'll continue to add more to our library as we go through time as well. Okay. Thanks Brett. You're absolutely right. Peak losses we expect in this fiscal year. We said at our Investor Day which wasn't too long ago that we expected to reach profitability in fiscal 2024. We're not going to change that at this point although we are very pleased with the results that we just announced. But we are also -- given the value of growing our sub base, we are continuing to invest in high-quality content. We believe that content is the single biggest driver to not only acquiring subs, but retaining them. We're also going to have some other cost drivers that we just have to factor into our timing for profitability and that includes marketing, technology, customer service and just other expenses of running a new business. So we're sticking to that 2024 -- fiscal 2024 profitability. But once again we're very pleased with where we are today. We believe that keeping subscribers informed about what's on the service is extremely important. So the awareness that we'll create through targeted marketing and marketing of the brand will basically mitigate what we believe is a very reasonable price increase given the amount of content and the value to subscribers. Hi, Mike. So on Hulu SVOD, when you look at the relative mix of ad-supported versus ad-free more of the subscribers are in the ad-free -- ad-supported. And that is where we have seen the really nice growth of our addressable advertising. So, that -- we're very comfortable and we actually -- we like the mix that we have, but it is more ad-supported, so we enjoy that relative increase of advertising. But it's pretty much been the track record that Hulu has of having that relationship of ad-supported versus ad-free has been relatively consistent, over their 10-year tenure."

            "content": "Thanks, Lowell, and hello everyone. I hope, you're all doing well and staying safe. Unfortunately, as you know, the COVID pandemic continues to present significant hurdles, for businesses and communities across the US and globally. And most important, it has taken a tragic toll, on way too many lives. Fortunately, there have been some encouraging developments, particularly with the availability of the vaccine. And we're pleased to be doing our part, by providing space at Disneyland for one of Southern California's major vaccine distribution sites. To-date more than 100,000 doses have been administered at our location. It's hard to believe nearly a year has passed since the start of the pandemic, which continues to negatively impact the operations of our company. For the first quarter, adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.32 a share, compared to $1.53 a share last year. Christine will talk more in-depth about our results for the quarter. During this difficult time we have made significant changes while finding new and innovative ways to conduct our businesses. But at the same time, we have chartered a course for an even more deliberate and aggressive DTC push for Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Star. I'm really proud of how well our team has performed, in the face of a multitude of ongoing challenges, both creatively and across our parks and experiences, and legacy and DTC distribution platforms. We've been especially pleased with the success of our direct-to-consumer business. And our recent strategic reorganization has enabled us to accelerate the company's pivot, towards a DTC-first business model and further grow our streaming services. Disney+ has exceeded even our highest expectations, in just over a year since its launch with 94.9 million subscribers, as of the end of the first fiscal quarter. ESPN+ and Hulu have also performed well, with 12.1 million and 39.4 million subscriptions, respectively. And on February 23rd, we will be launching our new international general entertainment offering Star, across Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. Star will offer thousands of hours of movies and television from the company's multiple studios, including content from our acquisition of 21st Century Fox, along with Star-branded exclusive originals and local programming, tailored to specific markets. Star will be integrated into Disney+, as a distinct sixth brand tile. And will offer easy to use, parental controls to manage access to the content available on Star. We're less than two weeks away from launch and we're seeing tremendous excitement amongst consumers. As you saw during our Investor Day presentation, we've got an amazing robust pipeline of original content in development and production, for our full portfolio of streaming services. We have some of the best creative teams in the business. And that's reflected in the tremendous appeal, of our unparalleled programming. In just the last two months, Disney+ has delivered a string of hit programs, including Marvel's incredibly original WandaVision, season two of The Mandalorian which ended with the surprise reveal that fan favorite Boba Fett will have his own Disney+ series starting this December; and Pixar's artistic triumph Soul, which debuted on the service and in theatres on Christmas Day to great acclaim and has since taken in nearly $100 million at the global box office. The wealth of IP from our unrivaled collection of brands and franchises provides us with an incredible breadth and depth of storylines and characters to mine for Disney+ and our other streaming services. We have the ability to interconnect these storylines and characters in unprecedented ways as we saw with The Mandalorian and WandaVision tying into the broader Star Wars and Marvel franchises. We're excited to continue exploring the endless possibilities that this unique ecosystem provides. The fan response was overwhelming when we announced last week that Ryan Coogler who's hard at work on Black Panther 2 will be developing a Black Panther inspired series based in the Kingdom of Wakanda for Disney+. We're also thrilled to be expanding the scope and reach of ESPN's, The Undefeated by creating a destination on Hulu devoted to black entertainment and culture, another example of our continuing commitment and investment in diversity and inclusion, and we can't wait for the award winning and critically acclaimed film, Nomadland, to be released in theatres and on Hulu on February 19th. And on March 5th, Disney Animation Studios Raya and the Last Dragon, an artistically beautiful film celebrating female empowerment will arrive in theatres and on Disney+ via our Premier Access. As we've said our goal is to increasingly put the consumer in charge and let them decide when and how they want to enjoy our one of a kind entertainment offerings. Turning to other parts of the company. We've made a number of changes in how we manage and operate our theme parks and consumer products businesses in light of the disruptions caused by the pandemic. And we believe these and other adjustments we'll continue to make will best position us to operate more effectively now and in a post-COVID environment. Where we have been able to reopen our theme parks with limited capacity, guests have consistently demonstrated a willingness and a desire to visit, which we believe is a testament to the fact that they feel confident in the health and safety protocols we put in place. Average daily attendance at Walt Disney World grew significantly from Q4 into Q1, helped in part by the increased capacity we've been able to achieve as a result of our successful protocols. It's clear that people want to reconnect with loved ones and spend time together doing things they enjoy. And given the demand we're seeing now, we're confident we'll only grow once the pandemic is behind us. Even under difficult circumstances, we've been able to continue expanding our parks. At Walt Disney World Resort we're hard at work on two brand-new attractions at Epcot, Remy's Ratatouille Adventure and the highly anticipated Marvel themed rollercoaster, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind. Work is also well-underway on the all-new spectacular nighttime show, Harmonious. This is all part of a much larger reimagining of Epcot to make it more Disney, more family friendly, more timeless and more magical. And I'm especially excited about the progress that's been made on the new Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser hotel at Walt Disney World. People are going to be blown away by the experience. It is truly unlike anything we've done before. At Disneyland Resort the exciting new Marvel themed land, Avengers Campus is currently scheduled to open later this year at Disney California Adventure. And crews are hard at work on the highly anticipated state-of-the-art attraction Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway coming to Disneyland in 2023. We're also moving forward on a number of new projects at our international parks. At Shanghai Disneyland, work continues on the first ever Zootopia themed land. This fully immersive area will seamlessly blend Disney storytelling with advanced technologies, creating a one of a kind experience for our guests. Throughout this challenging period we've consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver world-class programming on all of our platforms, digital and linear. On ABC, we continue to have the number one returning drama in the key demo of adults 18 to 49 with Grey's Anatomy as well as the top new drama of the fall Big Sky. Both Grey's and Big Sky also hold the top broadcast drama spots on Hulu. Also of note, ESPN's first ever NFL Wild Card MegaCast featured six networks including ABC, ESPN+ and ESPN Deportes. It was the most extensive multichannel offering to date for an NFL playoff game. In the following day, the team at ESPN pulled off an equally impressive seat with a MegaCast of the college football playoff national championship game with 14 different presentations on multiple platforms. During an extraordinarily difficult year, our amazing local and national ABC News teams have been doing an absolutely outstanding job. And Good Morning America and World News Tonight with David Muir continue to hold the top spot as the number one morning show and evening newscast. While these remain challenging times, we are more confident than ever that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position. We're proud of all that we've accomplished, especially as it relates to our top priority our DTC business and we believe that the strategic actions we're taking to transform our company will enable us to enhance the consumer and guest experience, grow and expand our businesses and increase shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn it over to Christine. Okay. In terms of the outlook for the parks for the rest of the year and the capacity, it's really going to be determined by the rate of vaccination of the public. That to us seems like the biggest lever that we can have in order to either take the parks that are currently under limited capacity and increase it or open up parks that are currently closed. So that is sort of the gating factor if you will. As Christine suggested, we have ample demand for our parks. Despite everything that's happening with that pandemic, I think we've made a pretty big impression on our consumer base and prospective guests in terms of the safety measures that we've undertaken at our parks to give assurances to people that they should come in and bring their families. And we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of future bookings. In terms of the cost savings and the technical side of things, not only has our industrial engineering team at Walt Disney World and some of our parks like Shanghai across the world figured out ways to have increased capacity with the same safety measures that we've had in place, which has enabled us to increase our, if you will, our attendance. But there we have been able to substantially manage our cost side at the same time to right-size, if you will, our -- not only our fixed cost base, but also our variable cost base to match what's happening. And I think that's evidenced by what Christine said that all of our parks, regardless of what conditions they're operating under, assuming they are operating, are in positive net contribution side. I would also add you didn't mention this, but I think it's important to add that given those per caps that Christine referenced in terms of the double-digit increase in per caps, this is sort of the ultimate situation where demand has exceeded supply. We've had that -- been fortunate enough to have that situation for the last couple of years and we've learned how to yield this business. And I think this is the ultimate situation where we've got supply greater than demand. So not only working on the cost side, but we're also working on the revenue side. And I think you see some of those results at play at Walt Disney World. Okay. In terms of the DTC business and Soul, as you remember, we took it out on Christmas Day, we thought that was a really nice thing to do for our consumer base and our subscriber base, given the holiday and given the fact that we have talked consistently about remaining flexible in terms of how we're going to go ahead and put our titles out into the marketplace. We were absolutely thrilled by what that brought to our business in terms of both acquisition and retention. And so, I would say, it was a big hit with our subscriber base. In terms of Mulan, I think the best thing I can say about Mulan is that it was successful to the extent that we're also using that strategy on Raya. So the individual decisions that we talked about in the future, in some films we'll take them theatrically and in some films we'll take them theatrically, plus Disney Premier Access as is the case with Raya and was the case with Mulan. And in some cases, we'll take it direct to service. It's going to be dependent, though, on what our slate of titles are and whether we think that we need to put something on the service for those particular guests, or whether this is something that we could use as another data point in our exploration of Premier Access [indiscernible] date with theatrical. So it's really about flexibility and we're going to steer our decision-making over time, given what information that we get from our guests and our subscriber base on what they prefer. Right. So I'm going to go back to the word flexibility, because we had made a reference at the investor conference that Black Widow was going to be a theatrical release and we are still intending it to be a theatrical release. But, again, we are going to be watching very carefully the reopening of theatres and the consumer sentiment in terms of desire to go back to theatres, to see whether that strategy needs to be revisited. But as of now the strategy is to continue on with the theatrical release and we'll be watching very, very carefully. Okay. So in terms of the local partnership -- well, first, I'm going to talk about -- I'll talk about the content side, because there was a content side element of it as well. There's really two things that gate our amount of content that's local in any given market, including Indonesia. And in some cases there are local requirements for local content, as a percentage of the total. So that is one factor that plays into it. And then, second one is what we think we need from a portfolio standpoint of overall content. And as you might suspect, we're pretty aggressively ramping up all of our production for all our local territories. In terms of the partnerships, in Indonesia, we're partnering with Telkomsel and we have a lot of data plan and promotional bundling that we're doing with them which not only is, sort of, keeping the rates at a place that's respectable in the marketplace given the overall economy there and what the market will bear, but also is giving us exposure possibly from a marketing standpoint and promotional standpoint to particular audience segments that we may not otherwise be able to get. So -- and in terms of overall churn are you going to take that one Christine? I would characterize this last year as being not only a year of challenge, but also a year of learning in terms of what we can do, in terms of sustained margin growth in our parks. I say that because there's nothing like a pandemic to challenge the status quo and make you be fairly introspective about a lot of things that you've maybe taken as fairly dogmatic. I think you've all seen several new announcements about things that we've done recently that may have been heresy prior to the pandemic like recasting of our annual pass program at Disneyland and reconsidering the overwhelming demand we have relative to supply. Everything we do the first lens we look at is to exceed guest expectations. And it's very tough when your park has more demand than supply, we have to put limits on it. Well as you know, we have a wide variety of margins depending on the nature of the guest and how they visit and when they visit. So with a lens towards maximizing the guest experience, we are now able to essentially reset many pieces of our business both on the cost and revenue side of the business in order to say, if we had a blank piece of paper how would we set up our parks business and be a little bit more aggressive than we typically might be able to be without the impetus of unfortunately a year-long closure. So we've had a lot of time to think particularly, at Disneyland about what could be and I think you're about to see some of those strategies be born. Okay. So I'll take the sports. ESPN is always a consideration whenever we look at rights going forward. In terms of the Super Bowl being down and as we're going into rights conversations with them that's obviously, something we're considering but more important than any one Super Bowl we're looking at the long-term trends of sports viewership, the MVPD universe and our own prospects of potentially a more true ESPN DTC service. So there's a lot of moving parts and a lot of elements in that mix but it's all taking into account the trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. What I will say is that we've had a long relationship with the NFL and if we have a deal, if there is a deal that will be accretive to shareholder value, we will certainly entertain that and look at that. But our first filter will be whether it makes sense for our shareholder standpoint going forward. In terms of sports betting. As you probably know we already have some programming on ESPN around the subject of sports betting. It particularly is attractive to the younger, very passionate sports audience that we find. So it's an important piece of what we're doing. We've got relationships with DraftKings and Caesars. We've got sports links with -- sports betting links with both of those, not branded Disney or ESPN obviously. But branded through their own offerings. We've got a studio in Las Vegas with Caesars that we're working on. And we've also got a variety of different things that we're entertaining for the future. So sports betting we do realize the value in that. We've obviously got some bumpers in terms of our own brand and what we think our own elasticity is in terms of us participating in such endeavors. But we're highly interested in taking the relationships that we have with both parties and taking them to the next level if that makes sense. Okay. Yes, we are still on schedule, where we will get to the great majority of our rollout markets by the end of the year. It's all green lights in terms of our launch not only in terms of preparation of the service itself and being able to handle it from a delivery standpoint, but also from a content curation standpoint both creation and acquisition again on the local content when we need that. As you know, we've got quite a slew of new content coming and great library of content, which really rounds out our offering and we'll add to that our local offerings in order to make it a fully robust offering for each particular market given the idiosyncrasies of what each market requires. So, it's all as planned. Yes. I won't specifically comment on whether we anticipate getting to 2019 revenues by 2022, but I will tell you what our expectations are in terms of the state of the world by then. We have no doubt that when we reopen up in parks that were closed or increase the capacity that we'll have some level of social distancing and mask wearing for the remainder of this year. That's our expectation. But I believe that Dr. Fauci said earlier today that, he hopes that there's vaccines for everyone who wants them by April this year. If that happens that is a game changer. And that could accelerate our expectations and give people the confidence that they need to come back to the parks. Will there be some overlap until we know that we've hit herd immunity? Sure there will. But do we also believe that we'll be in the same state of 6-foot social distancing and mask wearing in '22? Absolutely not. Hey thanks Jason. Operator, next question please. Yes. And on a multicast question, I think it's both, both elements. So I think there's a consumer benefit to the fact that nobody else, could do what ESPN does in terms of the multicast. And I think we've proven that in several different ways, over the last few months with big football events being broadcast. But I think there's also an element that, that then, is obvious not only to us and obvious to our consumers, but obvious to our prospective partners, as we go into negotiations of new deals. I think there's probably a, mentality that well the more times we divide this up, the better off we're going to be, from the prospective rights owners. And I think what we're doing is throwing a wrench into that thinking. And suggesting that, maybe by taking a consumer-first approach and saying, boy, consumer choice is really a good thing for everybody, let's go ahead and maximize the number of touch points we have, not only do we get a benefit from our subscriber base for those folks that have ESPN, but I think it's also very apparent to the leagues who hold the rights."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Walt Disney Company, Alexia Quadrani. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Bob Chapek, Disney\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thank you, Alexia and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal 2022 was a strong year for our company as we continued our journey of telling the incredible Disney stories, utilizing ground-breaking technology in order to further develop our brands and franchises while customizing and personalizing experiences to make magical memories that last a lifetime. Those efforts resulted in truly phenomenal storytelling, record annual results at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, and outstanding growth at our direct-to-consumer services, which added nearly 57 million subscriptions this year to reach a total of more than 235 million. We are particularly pleased with growth in the fourth quarter, which saw the addition of 14.6 million subscriptions across our suite of services including 12 million Disney+ subscriptions, over 9 million of which were core Disney+. It has taken just 3 short years for Disney+ to transform from a nascent business to an industry leader. That transformation is the direct result of the strategic decision we made at launch to heavily invest in our Direct-to-Consumer offering, a decision made knowing that achieving rapid growth would result in short-term losses. Building a streaming powerhouse has required significant investment. And now with its scale, incredible content pipeline and global reach, Disney+ is well situated to leverage our position for long-term profitability and success. Our financial results this quarter represent a turning point as we reached peak DTC operating losses, which we expect to decline going forward. That expectation is based on three factors: first, the benefit of both price increases and the launch of the Disney+ ad tier next month; second, a realignment of our cost, including meaningful rationalization of our marketing spend; and third, leveraging our learnings and experience in direct-to-consumer to optimize our content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement and subscriber acquisition. With these factors, we believe we are on a path to profitable streaming business that generates shareholder value long into the future. And assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate, we still expect Disney+ to achieve profitability in fiscal 2024 as losses begin to shrink in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Christine will go into more detail on the drivers of our direct-to-consumer operating performance and provide more insight into our expectations going forward and some of our key assumptions. But first, I\u2019d like to share a few highlights from the quarter. Q4 was another strong period for Parks, Experiences and Products, which continue to deliver phenomenal results despite the impact of Hurricane Ian. I want to thank the amazing cast members in Orlando who went above and beyond to help keep our guests safe and entertained during the storm. From protecting the many animals at Disney Animal Kingdom to packing thousands of meal kits to donating and delivering emergency supplies to the community, I am so proud of how our team came together to support our guests, our neighbors and each other. Our Parks team is laser focused on enhancing the guest experience in creating those magical memories I mentioned at the outset. This focus, along with the investments we made to bringing new attractions and experiences to our domestic parks, is generating consistently strong demand, which, on many days, exceeds our current capacity. And we continue to manage attendance levels with a focus on providing guests with the highest quality experience and enhancing our Parks\u2019 overall financial performance. One of the things our guests love most is the opportunity to celebrate at our parks as evidenced by the post-pandemic return and sell-out of special ticketed events like Boogie Boogie Bash and Mickey\u2019s Not So Scary Halloween Party. I visited Disneyland with my family just before Halloween and the celebration was phenomenal. Tickets for Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party at Walt Disney World has now officially gone on sale and over half of all dates have already sold out. As you know, we are about to embark on the company\u2019s 100th anniversary celebration. The fun kicks off at our parks on January 27 at Disneyland, where we will unveil new platinum infused decor, Premier 2, all new night-time spectaculars and opened a highly anticipated Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway attraction. This is only one part of what will be the largest cross-company celebration in Disney\u2019s history with activations around the world and we are so excited for fans and families to join us. At our international parks, Disneyland Paris is enjoying a great resurgence. Our fantastic new Marvel Avengers Campus opened on July 20 and guests love the highly immersive and dynamic environment of the first-ever Marvel-themed land in Europe. Prior to the recent closure of Shanghai Disney Resort, we are seeing positive momentum there and at Hong Kong Disneyland. We are hopeful that the situation will improve and are thinking of all of our employees there as we manage through the challenging COVID environment. Our Disney Cruise Line is showing strong signs of recovery. The new Disney Wish is in high demand, and we have seen a ramp-up in bookings for our base fleet. This quarter was also exceptionally strong in terms of creative excellence across our content engines. Our teams received 57 Emmy Awards spread across a remarkable 37 different titles emanating from a wide range of brands, franchises and distribution channels. ABC ended the season as number one in entertainment programming for the third consecutive year and ABC News continues to be the most trusted source in news with number one positions across all day parts. Theatrically, Thor: Love and Thunder, the character\u2019s fourth standalone film, earned over $760 million worldwide. This is our first time we released a fourth film based on a single Marvel character and Thor\u2019s longevity is a great sign for Marvel and our ability to tell stories based on its characters long into the future. The fourth quarter was also the first time in Disney history that we released tentpole original content from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and National Geographic, an indication that we are now at full cadence of new releases as we hit our steady state. As evidenced, Hocus Focus 2 was a smash hit, becoming not only the most watched premier on Disney+, but also a Nielsen record-setting streaming movie with 2.7 billion minutes viewed in its first weekend. And Marvel Studios, Ms. Marvel completed its run in July and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, debuted in August, contributing to subscriber growth and driving substantial engagement. Lucasfilm\u2019s Andor, a spy thriller that explores the back story of Cassian Andor, a popular character from Rogue One, earned great reviews and showcases our ability to extend stories from the big screen to our streaming services. Turning to general entertainment, the critically acclaimed Prey from 20th Century Studios was Hulu\u2019s biggest premier ever across all films and series and was the most watched film premier on Star+ in Latin America and Disney+ under the Star banner in all other territories. Looking ahead, we are thrilled that audiences are returning to the box office for blockbuster films and we have big plans for the big screen in the fiscal year 2023. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever opens this Friday and Ryan Coogler has delivered yet another culture-defining powerful film. The reaction to this film\u2019s premier a few weeks ago was incredible and fan anticipation is very high, as indicated by the strength of advanced ticket sales. Up next is Strange World from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which opens in theaters this Thanksgiving. The highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water opens on December 16 and is the sequel to the highest grossing film of all time. James Cameron and his team have once again created something truly magical using ground-breaking technology. Audiences are as excited as we are to return to Pandora. And given the strong performance of September\u2019s re-release of the original Avatar, we can\u2019t wait for the film to hit screens. Our Searchlight Studio continues to deliver critically acclaimed films and three fantastic titles will be in theaters this quarter: The Banshees of Inisherin, which has earned critical acclaim since its Venice premier; The Menu starting Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy; and the Empire of Light from Academy Award winner, Sam Mendes. Looking even further to 2023, we will see theatrical releases of three highly anticipated Marvel films: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, and The Marvels. And we could not be more excited about Disney live actions, the Little Mermaid, a re-imagining of one of the most popular animated films of all time, starring Halle Bailey, whose rendition A Part of Your World has already lit up the Internet. We are also bringing 999 Happy Haunts to Life with the hilarious new live action Haunted Mansion featuring an all-star cast. Pixar will debut an all new original feature, Elemental and Harrison Ford is back in the eagerly awaited fifth Indiana Jones film, which is going to be spectacular. Of course, all of our theatrical titles will eventually make their way on to our streaming platforms, complementing a robust slate of original content. Utopia+, a new series from Disney Animation debuts tomorrow, along with Save Our Squad, an original series from the UK that sees soccer superstar David Beckham return home to mentor a grassroots team of young boys struggling to survive in their league. On November 18, Disney+ will release Disenchanted, based on the successful Enchanted that came out 15 years ago. Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special will follow right after and Willow, another long-awaited sequel from Lucasfilm, will premiere the following week. We are so fortunate to have an abundance of content from all of our creative engines paired with the wealth of knowledge and insight into what resonates with our fans. As we move forward, we will increasingly leverage that knowledge to refine our distribution decisions in order to best serve our audience and maximize the return on our content investments. Turning to sports, ESPN was the number one cable network in total day and prime viewing amongst audiences aged 18 to 49 in Q4 and The Walt Disney Company was responsible for 40% of sports hours watched amongst that age bracket, the biggest share of any family of networks. ESPN continues to lead with its multi-platform sports ecosystem with reach across linear streaming, digital and social media serving fans at massive scale. With the power and support of The Walt Disney Company behind it, ESPN is an unequaled reach machine. And the business is well positioned through our strategic portfolio of long-term rights agreements with an eye to remaining disciplined in our approach. We recently announced an extension with Formula 1 through 2025, which is one of the fastest growing sports properties and is on pace to surpass last year\u2019s record audience on ESPN. The 2022 College Football season is off to its best 9-week start in 5 years across our networks. And thanks to our incoming SEC agreement in 2024, we will remain the leading college football platform with over 60% of the college football market. And our new long-term NFL agreement includes Super Bowls and annual ESPN+ exclusive match-up and more regular season and playoff games and better scheduling. On October 30, we marked another milestone moment in our DTC streaming services and the growth of ESPN+ when the Broncos versus Jaguars NFL game from London became our most viewed ESPN+ event ever. Finally, we are exactly 1 month from the U.S. launch of Disney+\u2019s ad-supported subscription offering, which is a win for audiences, advertisers and shareholders. The launch will bring fans a new slate of subscription plans across Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and the Disney bundle giving viewers flexibility in choosing an option that suits their needs. The offering also adds a key component to our total company advertising portfolio and advertiser interest has been strong. We have been a leader in streaming advertising for some time and are bringing our years of experience, leading ad tech and relationships to this important opportunity. Disney+ has secured more than 100 advertisers for our domestic launch window, spanning a wide range of categories and our company has over 8,000 existing relationships with advertisers who will have the opportunity to advertise on Disney+. Strong base pricing reflects the value advertisers put on our audience, our brand safe environment for their messages, and our sales experience. We also have proven technology to deliver a great advertising experience on day 1. And importantly, we have the ability to scale and innovate for audiences and advertisers alike. We are incredibly excited about the launch of our new ad-supported subscription offering for Disney+, which rolls out on December 8. 2022 was an important year of recovery coming out of the pandemic as we made foundational investments in our long-term success. As we celebrate the 3-year anniversary of Disney+ this week, I can\u2019t help but reflect upon how our commitment to and substantial investment in our DTC business has helped create the world\u2019s most powerful suite of streaming services with the ability to reach hundreds of millions of viewers around the world with must-see content. Services, which aren\u2019t just content delivery systems, but platforms that bring us closer to audiences than ever before and enable consumers to access more of The Walt Disney Company\u2019s total offering. With our unmatched brands and franchises, robust pipeline of content capable of filling all of our distribution channels, unique experiences and strong connections to audiences around the world, I believe we are well positioned for future long-term growth and I am confident in the path forward. With that, I will turn it over to Christine to talk in greater detail about our quarter and the year ahead.\nChristine McCarthy: Good afternoon, everyone. We have wrapped up another dynamic fiscal year. And as we enter into fiscal 2023, I will be diving a bit deeper than usual today into the results of our businesses and we will give some additional color on where we expect to go from here, especially given the inflection point that we believe we have now reached in our direct-to-consumer business. Excluding certain items, our company\u2019s diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.30 and for the full fiscal 2022 year, diluted EPS, excluding certain items, was $3.53. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment had another stellar quarter with DPEP operating income in the fourth quarter, more than doubling versus the prior year to $1.5 billion. Our domestic parks delivered significant year-over-year revenue and operating income growth despite an adverse impact of approximately $65 million to segment operating income from Hurricane Ian. And per capita spending remained strong, increasing 6% versus Q4 of fiscal 2021 and nearly 40% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the continued popularity of premium offerings, including Genie+ and Lightning Lane. We are also making meaningful progress on the return of international visitors to our domestic parks, particularly at Walt Disney World, where the mix of international attendance in the fourth quarter was roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels. Looking towards fiscal 2023, while we continue to monitor our booking trends for any macroeconomic impacts, we are still seeing robust demand at our domestic parks and are anticipating a strong holiday season in Q1. Disney Cruise Line was also a meaningful contributor to the year-over-year increase in domestic parks and experiences\u2019 operating income in Q4, reflecting the successful launch of the Disney Wish in July and continued recovery of the existing fleet coming out of the pandemic. Quarter-to-date, occupancy for the Wish continues to exceed 90%, while we have also seen a meaningful pickup in the rest of our fleet with booked revenue up versus pre-pandemic levels. At International Parks, fourth quarter results also improved significantly year-over-year, driven by continued strength at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a decrease at Shanghai Disney Resort. As Bob mentioned, the situation in Shanghai has recently been challenging. The park is currently closed, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date. Q4 results at Consumer Products also increased versus the prior year, driven by higher merchandise licensing results across several of our key franchises, including Mickey and Friends, Encanto and Toy Story. Moving on to Media and Entertainment Distribution. Operating income in the fourth quarter decreased by $864 million versus the prior year as a modest increase at linear networks was more than offset by wider losses at direct-to-consumer and to a lesser extent, at content, sales, licensing and other. At Linear Networks, operating income in the fourth quarter increased 6% to $1.7 billion, driven primarily by growth at domestic channels. The increase at domestic channels primarily reflects higher results at cable driven by lower programming and production costs, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, cable programming and production costs benefited from the timing of the NBA finals which were in Q4 of fiscal 2021 versus Q3 of fiscal 2022 as well as from lower costs for Major League Baseball programming due to fewer games under our new contract. These impacts were partially offset by higher NFL programming costs as a result of one additional game aired versus the prior year quarter. The decrease in cable advertising revenue versus the prior year fourth quarter also reflects the timing impact of the NBA Finals. ESPN advertising revenue in Q4 was down 23% year-over-year. However, adjusting for the timing impact of the NBA Finals, it was down roughly 2%. Note that in Q1 of fiscal 2023, we also expect to see a timing impact versus the prior year from two college football playoff games that are shifting into the second fiscal quarter this year versus the first quarter last year. Quarter-to-date, ESPN domestic cash advertising sales are pacing down, reflecting in part the absence of these two CFP games. The advertising landscape remains fluid. The sports marketplace, in particular, is delivering strong audiences across our platforms with marketers looking to take advantage of live events and several categories, including political, pharma, insurance and restaurants, have continued to show relatively stable demand while others remain cautious in anticipation of potential economic softness. Total domestic affiliate revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 2% from the prior year, driven by 5 points of growth from contractual rate increases, partially offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Looking ahead, we expect to see linear subscriber declines accelerate more in line with industry trends. International channels operating income decreased by $25 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, reflecting lower results from our ongoing channels and operation partially offset by a benefit from channel closures. At content sales, licensing and other, results decreased versus the prior year by a little over $100 million, in line with guidance due to lower TV/SVOD and home entertainment results, partially offset by higher theatrical results and an increase at our stage play business. While difficult comparisons may persist in the intermediate term at our TV/SVOD and home entertainment businesses, results will vary quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect content sales, licensing and other operating results to improve slightly in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. Finally, I\u2019d like to spend some time talking about our fourth quarter results at Direct-to-Consumer, where our losses peaked in the fourth quarter at approximately $1.5 billion. Hulu and ESPN+ added approximately 1 million and 1.5 million subscribers, respectively, during the quarter, while Disney+ added over 12 million global subscribers, of which a little less than 3 million were at Disney+ Hotstar. Core Disney+ added over 9 million subs in Q4, accelerating as expected versus the $6 million net adds we saw in the third quarter, reflecting the success of Disney+ Day and our Tempo content releases in addition to continued growth from third quarter market launches. Nearly $2 million of this net adds were from the U.S. and Canada and a little over 7 million were international core additions. At the same time, core Disney+ ARPU decreased by 5% between Q3 and Q4, reflecting an adverse foreign exchange impact and to a lesser extent, a slightly higher mix of subscribers from lower-priced international markets. ARPU at each streaming service is also impacted by the mix of subscribers to the bundle. Our bundled and multiproduct offerings now account for over 40% of our fiscal year-end domestic Disney+ subscriber count. This shift has been purposeful as the bundle drives higher total company subscription revenue and higher long-term subscriber value due to notably lower churn. Lower pay-per-view revenue at ESPN+ and slightly lower advertising revenue at Hulu and Disney+ Hotstar also impacted Direct-to-Consumer revenue in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. With our expectation that peak losses are now behind us, DTC operating results should improve going forward as we lay the foundation for a sustainably profitable business model. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect direct-to-consumer operating results to improve by at least $200 million versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, with larger improvement expected in Q2, reflecting a couple of key factors. First, our recently announced price increases across our Direct-to-Consumer offerings in the U.S. should begin to modestly benefit ARPU and subscription revenue in the first quarter. However, given that the Disney+ price increase will not go into effect until towards the end of Q1, this benefit will be realized more fully in the second quarter. Similarly, we do not expect the launch of the advertising-supported tier of Disney+ in December to provide a more meaningful financial impact until later this fiscal year. Additionally, our commitment to cost rationalization will allow us to scale effectively against our investments. In particular, while DTC programming and production costs will increase from Q4 to Q1 over the course of the year, content expense and OpEx growth should slow as we approach steady state and marketing costs should decline as we continue to focus on aligning our costs with our dynamic business models. As it relates to subscribers, we expect ESPN+ and Hulu will continue to add new subscribers in Q1, and we expect core Disney+ subscribers to increase only slightly in the quarter, reflecting tougher comparisons against Disney+ Day performance. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, subscriber growth will not be linear each and every quarter, and the trend is driven by several factors, including content releases and promotions. We expect Disney+ core subscriber growth to then accelerate in the fiscal second quarter, largely driven by international markets. And at Disney+ Hotstar, we are currently expecting that subscribers will decline in Q1 due to the absence of the IPL, but we do expect to see some stabilization in Q2. I\u2019ll note that our Direct-to-Consumer expectations are built on certain assumptions around subscriber additions based on the attractiveness of our future content, churn expectations for our upcoming price increases, the financial impact of the Disney+ ad tier and price increases and our ability to quickly execute on cost rationalization while preserving revenue, all of which, while based on extensive internal analysis as well as recent experience provides a layer of uncertainty in our outlook. Before we conclude, there are a couple of other items I would like to mention around our fiscal 2023 expectations. Cash content spend totaled $30 billion in fiscal 2022, and we continue to expect it to be in the low $30 billion range for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures totaled nearly $5 billion in fiscal 2022, in line with our expectations, and we currently expect that CapEx will increase in fiscal 2023 to a total of $6.7 billion, driven by higher spend across the enterprise. Putting this all together, assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the macroeconomic climate, we currently expect total company\u2019s fiscal 2023 revenue and segment operating income to both grow at a high single-digit percentage rate versus fiscal 2022. We are confident about the opportunities we see to continue to transform our business for the next 100 years and look forward to sharing our progress with you all throughout 2023. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Christine. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we\u2019re ready for your first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. It\u2019s good afternoon, sorry. Two questions, Bob. Can you talk a little bit about how \u2013 what\u2019s the consumer experience going to be like as you roll out this price increase here in a month? You\u2019ve got customers on lots of different plans, different distributors. Can you talk a little bit about your confidence that it\u2019s going to be seamless and that consumers will have the ability to choose the plan that works best for them? And then, Christine, on the Parks margins, U.S. margins this quarter. I think through the first three quarters of fiscal \u201822, margins were up pretty nicely versus \u201819, and they were actually down, I think, this quarter. It didn\u2019t sound like there was anything in your prepared remarks that sort of commented on that. There was a mention of cost inflation in the release. But just wondering if you could spend a little bit of time talking about some of the cost drivers in the U.S. Parks business in the quarter, anything unusual that you would want to call out and how we might want to think about that heading into \u201823? Thank you.\nBob Chapek: Alright. Thank you, Ben. In terms of trying to communicate to consumers the multitude of options we\u2019re getting them, we believe that more choice is actually good. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s predicated upon our ability to communicate the options to the consumer but we\u2019ve got so many years of history with Hulu, where we\u2019ve given them options between advertising and non-advertising Hulu+ Live TV, without Hulu+ Live TV that we believe that we\u2019ve got a pretty good formula for how we could communicate and that formulas* work very well domestically. And so we believe it will work as well internationally as well as across both Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that we\u2019ve got unmatched brands. And as we continue to go ahead and extend our reach and there are different business models, different pricing models to consumers that, that choice itself will really enable us to have maximum penetration regardless of the brand under which the option is given to consumers, but also at the same time, as our platforms become just that, more and more platforms and less and less just distribution options we\u2019ve got a pretty good formula, I think, for making that simple for the consumer, but also enabling for the consumer to go ahead and subscribe in the way that suits them best.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Ben, on your question about the Parks margins. So DPEP\u2019s segment margin came in around 20.4% for this quarter, and that is lower than previous quarters this year. Let\u2019s remember that Q4 is historically the lowest quarter of the year for margins. And there is two things going on here, both is on the revenue and the expense side. On the revenue side, it is primarily driven by traditional seasonality, back-to-school time and to a lesser extent, as I called out in my comments, the impact of Hurricane Ian, that was a $65 million drag on the quarter. We have been using 2019 as our base for comparison, pre-pandemic. So when you compare it to fiscal \u201819 Q4 the lower margin is driven by international park performance. And then if you flip to the expense side, the increase in quarter-over-quarter expenses is the continued effect of bringing on some more guest offerings. Those are things like night-time spectaculars. We also have hard ticket events, and they have a lot of cost just in terms of setup and breakdown. We also remember, have a new ship, the Wish that just started operations, and there are some other smaller one-time items, but those are the real drivers of that lower margin this quarter.\nAlexia Quadrani: Alright. Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi. Thank you. Turning to the DTC, I guess let\u2019s focus on the profit in \u201824 guidance. We have talked in the past that this means for probably a quarter or two in \u201824, not for the full year. Is that still the way to think about it? And I did notice the comment about assuming the economy maybe doesn\u2019t get worse or something like that. Can you just talk about what drove you to add that language?\nChristine McCarthy: Well, I will take that, Phil. So, direct-to-consumer for \u201824 profitability, you should be thinking about it as a quarter, not a year basis. And then on some of the profitability drivers that we talked about that I think answered the question about the economy. We do have things like the steady state of content on the service, that\u2019s independent of the economy. We are focusing on bundled offerings as we refine our value proposition. There is also increasing international core market penetration. Once again, that is somewhat reliant on a stable economy. And increasing ARPU through the pricing increases would also, I think be something that could be sensitive to the economic environment. We do have the Disney+ ad tier launch and ad monetization growth. And the indications that we have so far is that those are very strong. So, we really are looking at sort of the puts and takes on what\u2019s going to be economically sensitive. But we just think in abundance of caution, we really have to keep the health of the consumer in mind when we think about achieving all of our goals this upcoming year.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nPhilip Cusick: Thank you. If I can follow-up\u2026\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Go ahead, Phil.\nPhilip Cusick: I was just going to say you called out a few \u2013 both you and Bob called out G&A and marketing savings on the call. How is Disney thinking about just cost in general? Is there a process going on today to cut costs across the board? And what might the timing of that be? Thanks again.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. Thanks for that question and follow-up, Phil. We are actively evaluating our cost base currently, and we are looking for meaningful efficiencies. Some of those are going to provide some near-term savings and others are going to drive longer term structural benefits. I just would point to what we did in the parks during the pandemic. We did some structural changes and the parks is better off because of that. But those were structural benefits that did not flow back into their cost base. We will update you with more information as our plan evolves.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nPhilip Cusick: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I have two. One is on the parks in \u201823. I was trying to understand what levers can you pull do you think if there is a slow U.S. consumer, what can you do to kind of maintain the revenue growth or I guess the revenue that we have seen? So, in other words, what can be different this time versus previous downturns? And then Christine, I just want to* come back to that operating profit guide, which you never give. So, I appreciate the fact you did it. I am just trying to get the piece parts, right. DTC is going to get better, parks is showing the weakness. But can you hone in a bit on the outlook for the rest of DMED in \u201923? Is that what you see as kind of the slower of a lot of growth next year? Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. So, talking about parks, Michael, what is different is compared to the last time we had a slowdown in the economy for managing our parks business, we have more commercial tools and levers available to us. One of the ones that\u2019s quite obvious is discounting. That\u2019s something that we have used in the past, and we will continue to use it because it is an effective lever for managing your yield, but we are not going to use it to the extent to which we used it during the last recession. Some of the other things that are new would be the reservation system. So, we manage attendance now. We can track it real time. On many days, we are fully booked now, but we can adjust that and be very flexible and real time on adjusting it if we so choose. The other thing is we have a tiered pricing structure that gives us a lot of flexibility. And we also have re-imagined our annual pass business model, and we could also have some more flexibility in using our annual pass program. We also have technology advancements, and this is more on the expense side. That provides us opportunities for cost flexibility. So, we have things like mobile ordering, contactless check-in, so those kinds of things give us levers on the expense side. But we do feel that we have, once again, harkening back to the opportunity we took during the pandemic. We did permanently remove a significant amount of operating expense at the parks, and that better positions us right now as we go into an uncertain economic environment.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay.\nAlexia Quadrani: Michael, do you have a second question?\nMichael Nathanson: Well, it was on the OI guide, right, which you don\u2019t usually give. Just trying and dig into the DMED outlook given what you have said about the other businesses at this point.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. We gave the outlook that was more for the company as a whole, but we are still looking at DPEP being a strong \u2013 continuing its strong growth. DMED, we are looking at it in three components. The direct-to-consumer, we are looking at improving profitability, as we have mentioned. We believe that this quarter that we are reporting is the low point, and it will improve for here. CLS&O, that will have some challenges, as we said, so that will be variable quarter-to-quarter. And then we have to look at our linear business. And we do have sub declines that are in line with the industry, and that\u2019s one that is just an industry issue that we are all going to be managing through.\nAlexia Quadrani: Alright. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Maybe I guess \u2013 if you look at the streaming business as a whole, and if you step back and look at the strategy going forward, you will see a price increase next quarter. And of course, there is also the ad-supported tier that could help manage some of the churn. But as an offset, it seems like some of your marketing expense will be optimized along with some content spending. So, Bob, if you look at the guidance right now, your subscriber growth needs to accelerate going forward in order to get to the guidance, but a lot of the levers like pricing may actually force churn to be higher and marketing costs naturally trend a little bit lower. So, when we think about this, how do we reconcile the subscriber guidance with the financial model of the business? And does it make sense to maybe focus more on profitability rather than some growth from our perspective going forward?\nBob Chapek: Our approach going forward is going to be focused largely on profitability, keeping in mind though, that the revenue growth that we have is also going to be a key component towards the overall profitability. If we look at the content that\u2019s going to actually fuel our subscriber growth and our engagement, we are obviously managing that very carefully. Christine talked about some cost management initiatives. That\u2019s not only across marketing, but also on the content spending itself as well. But we have also got an opportunity, I believe to manage that profitability through that pricing power that we believe we have. We launched these services at tremendous values to the consumer. And everything that we have got shows us that we still have some opportunity for continued price value exploration on all of our services. So, we believe that \u2013 and our history shows that when we have taken price increases across our streaming businesses that we don\u2019t meaningfully increase churn or cancellations. So, we believe we have still got some headroom there. So, whether it\u2019s cost management or attention to revenue growth through sub ads through our great content additions or through ARPU, we believe that we have got a formula that gives us great confidence that we are going to achieve the guidance that we communicated.\nAlexia Quadrani: Great. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. So Bob, I think you called ESPN, a reach machine, and Christine talked about the cord-cutting and how that\u2019s something that everybody is going to be managing through. So, as you look to expand the reach of ESPN, I know we have had this question before, but how do you think about starting to make a lot of the marquee streaming rights \u2013 or sorry, marquee sports rights also available on the streaming services whether that\u2019s ESPN+ or others? And how do you think about monetizing in a streaming world with a lot more of those expensive rights available? And then, Christine, just on the CapEx, it\u2019s moving up $1.5 billion or so this year. I know some of that is maybe a shift of about $500 million from last year, but it\u2019s still a little more elevated than history. You said it was enterprise-wide. So, I am wondering if the increase is more capital projects on the park side or if it\u2019s other things like technology or studio expansions. Thank you\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of ESPN growth, I think we all have to keep in mind that, number one, ESPN is that powerhouse brand. And we certainly, over time, have been able to enjoy the benefits of that brand in a linear world. However, going forward, we have got the ability not only to continue to enjoy those benefits in the linear world, but also began to grow our opportunities in the digital realm and leverage that brand\u2019s growth into other avenues that therefore we have not been able to necessarily tap into. I think it\u2019s also important to look at ESPN in terms of an important part of the overall Disney portfolio or synergy machine. It is an integral part of the bundle itself. So, when you take the fact that it\u2019s a great brand, we have the opportunity to grow it into different avenues. And as I have said before, sort of one foot on the dock, one foot on the boat and be flexible in terms of our speed of evolution, I think it\u2019s going to be an important part of our business going forward. Live advertising continues to be a really important benefit that we sell into our advertising community. We have got multiple platforms, and I believe that it\u2019s going to be a very robust part of our company going forward, whether or not it\u2019s linear or whether it\u2019s digital or somewhere in between.\nChristine McCarthy: So, on CapEx, Steve, yes, you are right. It is up. That was in my comments. As you \u2013 for those who have followed the company for a while, we usually give you a CapEx number for the beginning of the year and by the end of the year, we haven\u2019t spent it all. So, there is some slippage that goes from 1 year into the next. And also just with supply chain and labor shortages in various parts of the world where we are having projects, that slippage is probably a little more amplified. We do have some technology spend both at the enterprise level as well as in DMED. Some of it is consumer-facing. Some of it is more internal to once again deliver longer term efficiencies. And we have DPEP projects pretty much everywhere around the globe. So, we are continuing to build out those projects either on schedule or with some slippage that is slipping into \u201823.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Alright. Thank you. Operator, I think we have time one more question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Morris from Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Morris: Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon guys. Two for me. One, Christine, I am hoping you can give us a little more detail on the sequential revenue decline at the DTC segment. You talked about foreign exchange. Could you quantify how much of it came from foreign exchange, because as I am looking at the ARPUs on the domestic business, domestic Disney+ in particular, they have sequentially come in as well. So, maybe how much was FX? And a little bit more detail on kind of at the core, what\u2019s driving that Disney+ ARPU compression. My second question is on sports rights. There was an article out today about Netflix potentially looking at some sports rights. Amazon seems to have had success with Thursday night football package. So, Bob, I am curious how you see the landscape changing as these new entrants come in, if you see it changing at all and how it impacts the environment? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. I will take the first one, Mike, on the revenue decline. So, there are a couple of things. One is that on the ARPU, the impact of foreign exchange on ARPU was about half of the decline. And we do hedge and we have very successfully managed through this year\u2019s strong dollar for the most part. However, as you know, we are in markets all over the globe and some of the markets in which we have launched their currency, we do not hedge for either extraordinarily high costs or illiquidity. So, that foreign exchange impact was about half of the impact. And the other one is lower pay-per-view and this was at ESPN+. We have UFC, but we had a different game sched \u2013 different match schedules. You can tell I am not a UFC fan when I call them games, but a different match schedule and the omission of a key personality in MacGregor. So, that actually were the two primary factors lowering that year-over-year revenue.\nAlexia Quadrani: Bob, do you want to take the second?\nBob Chapek: Okay. Yes, in terms of the sort of the landscape changing with new entrants, we really like our strong position that we have got going forward, not only in terms of the breadth of the sports that we are engaged in, but also the terms of the deals that we have. So, we have exercised with discipline. I think the college conferences in terms of our negotiation, making sure that we recognize that we don\u2019t need everything. We just need the right things. But also making sure that as we go forward, we are looking at multi-platform rights. We will not do deals where we don\u2019t get multi-platform rights to give us that very flexibility that we talked about toggling between sort of the more linear traditional legacy distribution channels and that of the more digital forward-looking platforms. The big one that\u2019s coming up, obviously, for us would be the NBA. We would love to be in business with the NBA. But again, we are going to do it in a fiscally responsible way and seeking multi-platform rights. So, we feel really good about our position going forward with the rights that we have already got and the one or two that are still in play.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nMichael Morris: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: I think with that, we will conclude the call. I think we are out of time.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thanks. Note that \u2013 I have to read a statement here, for those of you that are still on.

            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. We have wrapped up another dynamic fiscal year. And as we enter into fiscal 2023, I will be diving a bit deeper than usual today into the results of our businesses and we will give some additional color on where we expect to go from here, especially given the inflection point that we believe we have now reached in our direct-to-consumer business. Excluding certain items, our company's diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.30 and for the full fiscal 2022 year, diluted EPS, excluding certain items, was $3.53. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment had another stellar quarter with DPEP operating income in the fourth quarter, more than doubling versus the prior year to $1.5 billion. Our domestic parks delivered significant year-over-year revenue and operating income growth despite an adverse impact of approximately $65 million to segment operating income from Hurricane Ian. And per capita spending remained strong, increasing 6% versus Q4 of fiscal 2021 and nearly 40% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the continued popularity of premium offerings, including Genie+ and Lightning Lane. We are also making meaningful progress on the return of international visitors to our domestic parks, particularly at Walt Disney World, where the mix of international attendance in the fourth quarter was roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels. Looking towards fiscal 2023, while we continue to monitor our booking trends for any macroeconomic impacts, we are still seeing robust demand at our domestic parks and are anticipating a strong holiday season in Q1. Disney Cruise Line was also a meaningful contributor to the year-over-year increase in domestic parks and experiences' operating income in Q4, reflecting the successful launch of the Disney Wish in July and continued recovery of the existing fleet coming out of the pandemic. Quarter-to-date, occupancy for the Wish continues to exceed 90%, while we have also seen a meaningful pickup in the rest of our fleet with booked revenue up versus pre-pandemic levels. At International Parks, fourth quarter results also improved significantly year-over-year, driven by continued strength at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a decrease at Shanghai Disney Resort. As Bob mentioned, the situation in Shanghai has recently been challenging. The park is currently closed, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date. Q4 results at Consumer Products also increased versus the prior year, driven by higher merchandise licensing results across several of our key franchises, including Mickey and Friends, Encanto and Toy Story. Moving on to Media and Entertainment Distribution. Operating income in the fourth quarter decreased by $864 million versus the prior year as a modest increase at linear networks was more than offset by wider losses at direct-to-consumer and to a lesser extent, at content, sales, licensing and other. At Linear Networks, operating income in the fourth quarter increased 6% to $1.7 billion, driven primarily by growth at domestic channels. The increase at domestic channels primarily reflects higher results at cable driven by lower programming and production costs, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, cable programming and production costs benefited from the timing of the NBA finals which were in Q4 of fiscal 2021 versus Q3 of fiscal 2022 as well as from lower costs for Major League Baseball programming due to fewer games under our new contract. These impacts were partially offset by higher NFL programming costs as a result of one additional game aired versus the prior year quarter. The decrease in cable advertising revenue versus the prior year fourth quarter also reflects the timing impact of the NBA Finals. ESPN advertising revenue in Q4 was down 23% year-over-year. However, adjusting for the timing impact of the NBA Finals, it was down roughly 2%. Note that in Q1 of fiscal 2023, we also expect to see a timing impact versus the prior year from two college football playoff games that are shifting into the second fiscal quarter this year versus the first quarter last year. Quarter-to-date, ESPN domestic cash advertising sales are pacing down, reflecting in part the absence of these two CFP games. The advertising landscape remains fluid. The sports marketplace, in particular, is delivering strong audiences across our platforms with marketers looking to take advantage of live events and several categories, including political, pharma, insurance and restaurants, have continued to show relatively stable demand while others remain cautious in anticipation of potential economic softness. Total domestic affiliate revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 2% from the prior year, driven by 5 points of growth from contractual rate increases, partially offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Looking ahead, we expect to see linear subscriber declines accelerate more in line with industry trends. International channels operating income decreased by $25 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, reflecting lower results from our ongoing channels and operation partially offset by a benefit from channel closures. At content sales, licensing and other, results decreased versus the prior year by a little over $100 million, in line with guidance due to lower TV/SVOD and home entertainment results, partially offset by higher theatrical results and an increase at our stage play business. While difficult comparisons may persist in the intermediate term at our TV/SVOD and home entertainment businesses, results will vary quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect content sales, licensing and other operating results to improve slightly in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. Finally, I'd like to spend some time talking about our fourth quarter results at Direct-to-Consumer, where our losses peaked in the fourth quarter at approximately $1.5 billion. Hulu and ESPN+ added approximately 1 million and 1.5 million subscribers, respectively, during the quarter, while Disney+ added over 12 million global subscribers, of which a little less than 3 million were at Disney+ Hotstar. Core Disney+ added over 9 million subs in Q4, accelerating as expected versus the $6 million net adds we saw in the third quarter, reflecting the success of Disney+ Day and our Tempo content releases in addition to continued growth from third quarter market launches. Nearly $2 million of this net adds were from the U.S. and Canada and a little over 7 million were international core additions. At the same time, core Disney+ ARPU decreased by 5% between Q3 and Q4, reflecting an adverse foreign exchange impact and to a lesser extent, a slightly higher mix of subscribers from lower-priced international markets. ARPU at each streaming service is also impacted by the mix of subscribers to the bundle. Our bundled and multiproduct offerings now account for over 40% of our fiscal year-end domestic Disney+ subscriber count. This shift has been purposeful as the bundle drives higher total company subscription revenue and higher long-term subscriber value due to notably lower churn. Lower pay-per-view revenue at ESPN+ and slightly lower advertising revenue at Hulu and Disney+ Hotstar also impacted Direct-to-Consumer revenue in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. With our expectation that peak losses are now behind us, DTC operating results should improve going forward as we lay the foundation for a sustainably profitable business model. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect direct-to-consumer operating results to improve by at least $200 million versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, with larger improvement expected in Q2, reflecting a couple of key factors. First, our recently announced price increases across our Direct-to-Consumer offerings in the U.S. should begin to modestly benefit ARPU and subscription revenue in the first quarter. However, given that the Disney+ price increase will not go into effect until towards the end of Q1, this benefit will be realized more fully in the second quarter. Similarly, we do not expect the launch of the advertising-supported tier of Disney+ in December to provide a more meaningful financial impact until later this fiscal year. Additionally, our commitment to cost rationalization will allow us to scale effectively against our investments. In particular, while DTC programming and production costs will increase from Q4 to Q1 over the course of the year, content expense and OpEx growth should slow as we approach steady state and marketing costs should decline as we continue to focus on aligning our costs with our dynamic business models. As it relates to subscribers, we expect ESPN+ and Hulu will continue to add new subscribers in Q1, and we expect core Disney+ subscribers to increase only slightly in the quarter, reflecting tougher comparisons against Disney+ Day performance. As we've mentioned before, subscriber growth will not be linear each and every quarter, and the trend is driven by several factors, including content releases and promotions. We expect Disney+ core subscriber growth to then accelerate in the fiscal second quarter, largely driven by international markets. And at Disney+ Hotstar, we are currently expecting that subscribers will decline in Q1 due to the absence of the IPL, but we do expect to see some stabilization in Q2. I'll note that our Direct-to-Consumer expectations are built on certain assumptions around subscriber additions based on the attractiveness of our future content, churn expectations for our upcoming price increases, the financial impact of the Disney+ ad tier and price increases and our ability to quickly execute on cost rationalization while preserving revenue, all of which, while based on extensive internal analysis as well as recent experience provides a layer of uncertainty in our outlook. Before we conclude, there are a couple of other items I would like to mention around our fiscal 2023 expectations. Cash content spend totaled $30 billion in fiscal 2022, and we continue to expect it to be in the low $30 billion range for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures totaled nearly $5 billion in fiscal 2022, in line with our expectations, and we currently expect that CapEx will increase in fiscal 2023 to a total of $6.7 billion, driven by higher spend across the enterprise. Putting this all together, assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the macroeconomic climate, we currently expect total company's fiscal 2023 revenue and segment operating income to both grow at a high single-digit percentage rate versus fiscal 2022. We are confident about the opportunities we see to continue to transform our business for the next 100 years and look forward to sharing our progress with you all throughout 2023. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions. Okay. Ben, on your question about the Parks margins. So DPEP's segment margin came in around 20.4% for this quarter, and that is lower than previous quarters this year. Let's remember that Q4 is historically the lowest quarter of the year for margins. And there is two things going on here, both is on the revenue and the expense side. On the revenue side, it is primarily driven by traditional seasonality, back-to-school time and to a lesser extent, as I called out in my comments, the impact of Hurricane Ian, that was a $65 million drag on the quarter. We have been using 2019 as our base for comparison, pre-pandemic. So when you compare it to fiscal \u201819 Q4 the lower margin is driven by international park performance. And then if you flip to the expense side, the increase in quarter-over-quarter expenses is the continued effect of bringing on some more guest offerings. Those are things like night-time spectaculars. We also have hard ticket events, and they have a lot of cost just in terms of setup and breakdown. We also remember, have a new ship, the Wish that just started operations, and there are some other smaller one-time items, but those are the real drivers of that lower margin this quarter. Well, I will take that, Phil. So, direct-to-consumer for \u201824 profitability, you should be thinking about it as a quarter, not a year basis. And then on some of the profitability drivers that we talked about that I think answered the question about the economy. We do have things like the steady state of content on the service, that's independent of the economy. We are focusing on bundled offerings as we refine our value proposition. There is also increasing international core market penetration. Once again, that is somewhat reliant on a stable economy. And increasing ARPU through the pricing increases would also, I think be something that could be sensitive to the economic environment. We do have the Disney+ ad tier launch and ad monetization growth. And the indications that we have so far is that those are very strong. So, we really are looking at sort of the puts and takes on what's going to be economically sensitive. But we just think in abundance of caution, we really have to keep the health of the consumer in mind when we think about achieving all of our goals this upcoming year. Yes. Thanks for that question and follow-up, Phil. We are actively evaluating our cost base currently, and we are looking for meaningful efficiencies. Some of those are going to provide some near-term savings and others are going to drive longer term structural benefits. I just would point to what we did in the parks during the pandemic. We did some structural changes and the parks is better off because of that. But those were structural benefits that did not flow back into their cost base. We will update you with more information as our plan evolves. Yes. So, talking about parks, Michael, what is different is compared to the last time we had a slowdown in the economy for managing our parks business, we have more commercial tools and levers available to us. One of the ones that's quite obvious is discounting. That's something that we have used in the past, and we will continue to use it because it is an effective lever for managing your yield, but we are not going to use it to the extent to which we used it during the last recession. Some of the other things that are new would be the reservation system. So, we manage attendance now. We can track it real time. On many days, we are fully booked now, but we can adjust that and be very flexible and real time on adjusting it if we so choose. The other thing is we have a tiered pricing structure that gives us a lot of flexibility. And we also have re-imagined our annual pass business model, and we could also have some more flexibility in using our annual pass program. We also have technology advancements, and this is more on the expense side. That provides us opportunities for cost flexibility. So, we have things like mobile ordering, contactless check-in, so those kinds of things give us levers on the expense side. But we do feel that we have, once again, harkening back to the opportunity we took during the pandemic. We did permanently remove a significant amount of operating expense at the parks, and that better positions us right now as we go into an uncertain economic environment. Yes. We gave the outlook that was more for the company as a whole, but we are still looking at DPEP being a strong \u2013 continuing its strong growth. DMED, we are looking at it in three components. The direct-to-consumer, we are looking at improving profitability, as we have mentioned. We believe that this quarter that we are reporting is the low point, and it will improve for here. CLS&O, that will have some challenges, as we said, so that will be variable quarter-to-quarter. And then we have to look at our linear business. And we do have sub declines that are in line with the industry, and that's one that is just an industry issue that we are all going to be managing through. So, on CapEx, Steve, yes, you are right. It is up. That was in my comments. As you \u2013 for those who have followed the company for a while, we usually give you a CapEx number for the beginning of the year and by the end of the year, we haven't spent it all. So, there is some slippage that goes from 1 year into the next. And also just with supply chain and labor shortages in various parts of the world where we are having projects, that slippage is probably a little more amplified. We do have some technology spend both at the enterprise level as well as in DMED. Some of it is consumer-facing. Some of it is more internal to once again deliver longer term efficiencies. And we have DPEP projects pretty much everywhere around the globe. So, we are continuing to build out those projects either on schedule or with some slippage that is slipping into \u201823. Yes. I will take the first one, Mike, on the revenue decline. So, there are a couple of things. One is that on the ARPU, the impact of foreign exchange on ARPU was about half of the decline. And we do hedge and we have very successfully managed through this year's strong dollar for the most part. However, as you know, we are in markets all over the globe and some of the markets in which we have launched their currency, we do not hedge for either extraordinarily high costs or illiquidity. So, that foreign exchange impact was about half of the impact. And the other one is lower pay-per-view and this was at ESPN+. We have UFC, but we had a different game sched \u2013 different match schedules. You can tell I am not a UFC fan when I call them games, but a different match schedule and the omission of a key personality in MacGregor. So, that actually were the two primary factors lowering that year-over-year revenue."

            "name": "Bob Chapek",
            "content": "Thank you, Alexia and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal 2022 was a strong year for our company as we continued our journey of telling the incredible Disney stories, utilizing ground-breaking technology in order to further develop our brands and franchises while customizing and personalizing experiences to make magical memories that last a lifetime. Those efforts resulted in truly phenomenal storytelling, record annual results at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, and outstanding growth at our direct-to-consumer services, which added nearly 57 million subscriptions this year to reach a total of more than 235 million. We are particularly pleased with growth in the fourth quarter, which saw the addition of 14.6 million subscriptions across our suite of services including 12 million Disney+ subscriptions, over 9 million of which were core Disney+. It has taken just 3 short years for Disney+ to transform from a nascent business to an industry leader. That transformation is the direct result of the strategic decision we made at launch to heavily invest in our Direct-to-Consumer offering, a decision made knowing that achieving rapid growth would result in short-term losses. Building a streaming powerhouse has required significant investment. And now with its scale, incredible content pipeline and global reach, Disney+ is well situated to leverage our position for long-term profitability and success. Our financial results this quarter represent a turning point as we reached peak DTC operating losses, which we expect to decline going forward. That expectation is based on three factors: first, the benefit of both price increases and the launch of the Disney+ ad tier next month; second, a realignment of our cost, including meaningful rationalization of our marketing spend; and third, leveraging our learnings and experience in direct-to-consumer to optimize our content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement and subscriber acquisition. With these factors, we believe we are on a path to profitable streaming business that generates shareholder value long into the future. And assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate, we still expect Disney+ to achieve profitability in fiscal 2024 as losses begin to shrink in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Christine will go into more detail on the drivers of our direct-to-consumer operating performance and provide more insight into our expectations going forward and some of our key assumptions. But first, I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter. Q4 was another strong period for Parks, Experiences and Products, which continue to deliver phenomenal results despite the impact of Hurricane Ian. I want to thank the amazing cast members in Orlando who went above and beyond to help keep our guests safe and entertained during the storm. From protecting the many animals at Disney Animal Kingdom to packing thousands of meal kits to donating and delivering emergency supplies to the community, I am so proud of how our team came together to support our guests, our neighbors and each other. Our Parks team is laser focused on enhancing the guest experience in creating those magical memories I mentioned at the outset. This focus, along with the investments we made to bringing new attractions and experiences to our domestic parks, is generating consistently strong demand, which, on many days, exceeds our current capacity. And we continue to manage attendance levels with a focus on providing guests with the highest quality experience and enhancing our Parks' overall financial performance. One of the things our guests love most is the opportunity to celebrate at our parks as evidenced by the post-pandemic return and sell-out of special ticketed events like Boogie Boogie Bash and Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party. I visited Disneyland with my family just before Halloween and the celebration was phenomenal. Tickets for Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party at Walt Disney World has now officially gone on sale and over half of all dates have already sold out. As you know, we are about to embark on the company's 100th anniversary celebration. The fun kicks off at our parks on January 27 at Disneyland, where we will unveil new platinum infused decor, Premier 2, all new night-time spectaculars and opened a highly anticipated Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway attraction. This is only one part of what will be the largest cross-company celebration in Disney's history with activations around the world and we are so excited for fans and families to join us. At our international parks, Disneyland Paris is enjoying a great resurgence. Our fantastic new Marvel Avengers Campus opened on July 20 and guests love the highly immersive and dynamic environment of the first-ever Marvel-themed land in Europe. Prior to the recent closure of Shanghai Disney Resort, we are seeing positive momentum there and at Hong Kong Disneyland. We are hopeful that the situation will improve and are thinking of all of our employees there as we manage through the challenging COVID environment. Our Disney Cruise Line is showing strong signs of recovery. The new Disney Wish is in high demand, and we have seen a ramp-up in bookings for our base fleet. This quarter was also exceptionally strong in terms of creative excellence across our content engines. Our teams received 57 Emmy Awards spread across a remarkable 37 different titles emanating from a wide range of brands, franchises and distribution channels. ABC ended the season as number one in entertainment programming for the third consecutive year and ABC News continues to be the most trusted source in news with number one positions across all day parts. Theatrically, Thor: Love and Thunder, the character's fourth standalone film, earned over $760 million worldwide. This is our first time we released a fourth film based on a single Marvel character and Thor's longevity is a great sign for Marvel and our ability to tell stories based on its characters long into the future. The fourth quarter was also the first time in Disney history that we released tentpole original content from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and National Geographic, an indication that we are now at full cadence of new releases as we hit our steady state. As evidenced, Hocus Focus 2 was a smash hit, becoming not only the most watched premier on Disney+, but also a Nielsen record-setting streaming movie with 2.7 billion minutes viewed in its first weekend. And Marvel Studios, Ms. Marvel completed its run in July and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, debuted in August, contributing to subscriber growth and driving substantial engagement. Lucasfilm's Andor, a spy thriller that explores the back story of Cassian Andor, a popular character from Rogue One, earned great reviews and showcases our ability to extend stories from the big screen to our streaming services. Turning to general entertainment, the critically acclaimed Prey from 20th Century Studios was Hulu's biggest premier ever across all films and series and was the most watched film premier on Star+ in Latin America and Disney+ under the Star banner in all other territories. Looking ahead, we are thrilled that audiences are returning to the box office for blockbuster films and we have big plans for the big screen in the fiscal year 2023. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever opens this Friday and Ryan Coogler has delivered yet another culture-defining powerful film. The reaction to this film's premier a few weeks ago was incredible and fan anticipation is very high, as indicated by the strength of advanced ticket sales. Up next is Strange World from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which opens in theaters this Thanksgiving. The highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water opens on December 16 and is the sequel to the highest grossing film of all time. James Cameron and his team have once again created something truly magical using ground-breaking technology. Audiences are as excited as we are to return to Pandora. And given the strong performance of September's re-release of the original Avatar, we can't wait for the film to hit screens. Our Searchlight Studio continues to deliver critically acclaimed films and three fantastic titles will be in theaters this quarter: The Banshees of Inisherin, which has earned critical acclaim since its Venice premier; The Menu starting Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy; and the Empire of Light from Academy Award winner, Sam Mendes. Looking even further to 2023, we will see theatrical releases of three highly anticipated Marvel films: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, and The Marvels. And we could not be more excited about Disney live actions, the Little Mermaid, a re-imagining of one of the most popular animated films of all time, starring Halle Bailey, whose rendition A Part of Your World has already lit up the Internet. We are also bringing 999 Happy Haunts to Life with the hilarious new live action Haunted Mansion featuring an all-star cast. Pixar will debut an all new original feature, Elemental and Harrison Ford is back in the eagerly awaited fifth Indiana Jones film, which is going to be spectacular. Of course, all of our theatrical titles will eventually make their way on to our streaming platforms, complementing a robust slate of original content. Utopia+, a new series from Disney Animation debuts tomorrow, along with Save Our Squad, an original series from the UK that sees soccer superstar David Beckham return home to mentor a grassroots team of young boys struggling to survive in their league. On November 18, Disney+ will release Disenchanted, based on the successful Enchanted that came out 15 years ago. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special will follow right after and Willow, another long-awaited sequel from Lucasfilm, will premiere the following week. We are so fortunate to have an abundance of content from all of our creative engines paired with the wealth of knowledge and insight into what resonates with our fans. As we move forward, we will increasingly leverage that knowledge to refine our distribution decisions in order to best serve our audience and maximize the return on our content investments. Turning to sports, ESPN was the number one cable network in total day and prime viewing amongst audiences aged 18 to 49 in Q4 and The Walt Disney Company was responsible for 40% of sports hours watched amongst that age bracket, the biggest share of any family of networks. ESPN continues to lead with its multi-platform sports ecosystem with reach across linear streaming, digital and social media serving fans at massive scale. With the power and support of The Walt Disney Company behind it, ESPN is an unequaled reach machine. And the business is well positioned through our strategic portfolio of long-term rights agreements with an eye to remaining disciplined in our approach. We recently announced an extension with Formula 1 through 2025, which is one of the fastest growing sports properties and is on pace to surpass last year's record audience on ESPN. The 2022 College Football season is off to its best 9-week start in 5 years across our networks. And thanks to our incoming SEC agreement in 2024, we will remain the leading college football platform with over 60% of the college football market. And our new long-term NFL agreement includes Super Bowls and annual ESPN+ exclusive match-up and more regular season and playoff games and better scheduling. On October 30, we marked another milestone moment in our DTC streaming services and the growth of ESPN+ when the Broncos versus Jaguars NFL game from London became our most viewed ESPN+ event ever. Finally, we are exactly 1 month from the U.S. launch of Disney+'s ad-supported subscription offering, which is a win for audiences, advertisers and shareholders. The launch will bring fans a new slate of subscription plans across Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and the Disney bundle giving viewers flexibility in choosing an option that suits their needs. The offering also adds a key component to our total company advertising portfolio and advertiser interest has been strong. We have been a leader in streaming advertising for some time and are bringing our years of experience, leading ad tech and relationships to this important opportunity. Disney+ has secured more than 100 advertisers for our domestic launch window, spanning a wide range of categories and our company has over 8,000 existing relationships with advertisers who will have the opportunity to advertise on Disney+. Strong base pricing reflects the value advertisers put on our audience, our brand safe environment for their messages, and our sales experience. We also have proven technology to deliver a great advertising experience on day 1. And importantly, we have the ability to scale and innovate for audiences and advertisers alike. We are incredibly excited about the launch of our new ad-supported subscription offering for Disney+, which rolls out on December 8. 2022 was an important year of recovery coming out of the pandemic as we made foundational investments in our long-term success. As we celebrate the 3-year anniversary of Disney+ this week, I can't help but reflect upon how our commitment to and substantial investment in our DTC business has helped create the world's most powerful suite of streaming services with the ability to reach hundreds of millions of viewers around the world with must-see content. Services, which aren't just content delivery systems, but platforms that bring us closer to audiences than ever before and enable consumers to access more of The Walt Disney Company's total offering. With our unmatched brands and franchises, robust pipeline of content capable of filling all of our distribution channels, unique experiences and strong connections to audiences around the world, I believe we are well positioned for future long-term growth and I am confident in the path forward. With that, I will turn it over to Christine to talk in greater detail about our quarter and the year ahead. Alright. Thank you, Ben. In terms of trying to communicate to consumers the multitude of options we're getting them, we believe that more choice is actually good. And you're right, it's predicated upon our ability to communicate the options to the consumer but we've got so many years of history with Hulu, where we've given them options between advertising and non-advertising Hulu+ Live TV, without Hulu+ Live TV that we believe that we've got a pretty good formula for how we could communicate and that formulas* work very well domestically. And so we believe it will work as well internationally as well as across both Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. I think it's important to keep in mind that we've got unmatched brands. And as we continue to go ahead and extend our reach and there are different business models, different pricing models to consumers that, that choice itself will really enable us to have maximum penetration regardless of the brand under which the option is given to consumers, but also at the same time, as our platforms become just that, more and more platforms and less and less just distribution options we've got a pretty good formula, I think, for making that simple for the consumer, but also enabling for the consumer to go ahead and subscribe in the way that suits them best. Our approach going forward is going to be focused largely on profitability, keeping in mind though, that the revenue growth that we have is also going to be a key component towards the overall profitability. If we look at the content that's going to actually fuel our subscriber growth and our engagement, we are obviously managing that very carefully. Christine talked about some cost management initiatives. That's not only across marketing, but also on the content spending itself as well. But we have also got an opportunity, I believe to manage that profitability through that pricing power that we believe we have. We launched these services at tremendous values to the consumer. And everything that we have got shows us that we still have some opportunity for continued price value exploration on all of our services. So, we believe that \u2013 and our history shows that when we have taken price increases across our streaming businesses that we don't meaningfully increase churn or cancellations. So, we believe we have still got some headroom there. So, whether it's cost management or attention to revenue growth through sub ads through our great content additions or through ARPU, we believe that we have got a formula that gives us great confidence that we are going to achieve the guidance that we communicated. Okay. In terms of ESPN growth, I think we all have to keep in mind that, number one, ESPN is that powerhouse brand. And we certainly, over time, have been able to enjoy the benefits of that brand in a linear world. However, going forward, we have got the ability not only to continue to enjoy those benefits in the linear world, but also began to grow our opportunities in the digital realm and leverage that brand's growth into other avenues that therefore we have not been able to necessarily tap into. I think it's also important to look at ESPN in terms of an important part of the overall Disney portfolio or synergy machine. It is an integral part of the bundle itself. So, when you take the fact that it's a great brand, we have the opportunity to grow it into different avenues. And as I have said before, sort of one foot on the dock, one foot on the boat and be flexible in terms of our speed of evolution, I think it's going to be an important part of our business going forward. Live advertising continues to be a really important benefit that we sell into our advertising community. We have got multiple platforms, and I believe that it's going to be a very robust part of our company going forward, whether or not it's linear or whether it's digital or somewhere in between. Okay. Yes, in terms of the sort of the landscape changing with new entrants, we really like our strong position that we have got going forward, not only in terms of the breadth of the sports that we are engaged in, but also the terms of the deals that we have. So, we have exercised with discipline. I think the college conferences in terms of our negotiation, making sure that we recognize that we don't need everything. We just need the right things. But also making sure that as we go forward, we are looking at multi-platform rights. We will not do deals where we don't get multi-platform rights to give us that very flexibility that we talked about toggling between sort of the more linear traditional legacy distribution channels and that of the more digital forward-looking platforms. The big one that's coming up, obviously, for us would be the NBA. We would love to be in business with the NBA. But again, we are going to do it in a fiscally responsible way and seeking multi-platform rights. So, we feel really good about our position going forward with the rights that we have already got and the one or two that are still in play."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's third quarter 2022 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thank you, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. We had an excellent quarter powered by world-class storytelling, outstanding performance at our domestic theme parks, increases in live sports viewership across our linear channels and ESPN+ and significant subscriber growth at our streaming services which added 15.5 million subscriptions in the quarter, including 14.4 million Disney+ subscribers, of which 6 million were core Disney+ and 8 million were Hotstar. As of the close of Q3, we now have 221 million total subscriptions across our streaming offerings. Our results showcase the ability of The Walt Disney Company\u2019s uniquely diversified business to power our ecosystems and explore growth opportunities across industries and distributions channels. I\u2019ll expand on all this and more and then Christine will go through the details of our results and provide additional insight into our fiscal 2024 expectations for Disney+. Creative excellence in storytelling that builds deep emotional connections with audiences is at the root of our success. And I am pleased to say that our creative engines are firing on all cylinders across franchise, general entertainment and sports. In a testament to the depth, breadth and quality of our creative teams, we received 147 Primetime Emmy award nominations this year, including 92 for our streaming platforms and 21 for best program in a genre, recognition across formats and distribution channels with 47 different shows receiving nominations, including titles like Only Murders in the Building. Abbott Elementary, What We Do in the Shadows and The Dropout, right alongside shows from Disney, Marvel and Star Wars. And most recently, we received an additional 71 news and documentary Emmy nominations across ABC News, National Geographic, FX, Hulu and ESPN. In addition to critical and industry recognition, we are thrilled by the audience response to our general entertainment offerings, response that is enhanced by a distribution strategy that maximizes reach by taking advantage of the strength of both our linear and streaming channels. Given the multiple ways, we bring our content to audiences, we take a thoughtful approach to each distribution decision to determine the best strategy for each of our many high-quality titles and platforms. Some like the Buzz-Generating Candy, the Kardashians and The Bear may be best served as Hulu originals. Others like Abbott Elementary and The Old Man have become multiplatform hits by reaching different audience demographics, across both linear and streaming. And when it comes to our key franchise content, I could not be more proud of the teams at Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. The hugely successful, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has earned nearly $1 billion at the global box office. And Thor: Love and Thunder, which premiered on July 8 has grossed over $700 million at the global box office and is the highest domestic grossing film of the Thor franchise. Pixar's Lightyear, marked the studios return to the big screen and the film debuted on Disney+ last week. Speaking of Disney+, which is now available in 155 markets after recently launching in 53 new territories, we released content with appeal across demographic groups including Obi-wan Kenobi and Ms. Marvel, as well as feature films like Disney's Chip n' Dale: Rescue Rangers and Disney Nature's: Polar Bear. As you know Disney+ is still a young business and we are learning more every day about the services ability to attract new fans to our powerhouse franchises. For example, in addition to driving engagement amongst tens of millions of existing Marvel fans, we have seen each new Disney+ original Marvel series, attract incremental viewership and new subscribers that hadn't previously engaged with Marvel content on the service, thanks to the episodic format that enables us to explore new characters and genres. The value of expanding the fan base is tremendous, and this new audience can then experience Marvel across our other offerings from consumer products to games to theme parks. Looking ahead Q4, will feature a fantastic Disney+ content slate, with the steady flow of key releases including Marvel's, She-Hulk, Attorney at Law, Lucas Films' Andor and Disney's Hocus Pocus 2 and we look forward to celebrating the second annual Disney+ Day on September 8 with activations across our synergy machine. Given the global nature of Disney+, we are thrilled to bring international music sensation BTS to the service, with an exclusive cinematic concert film and docuseries following the band's incredible journey. BTS and the K-Pop genre at large, carry massive global appeal and affinity, which will further extend our reach into that global fan base.  And we continue to step up our investment in international local originals, across formats including bringing the seventh season of Coffee With Karan, one of India's most popular talk shows exclusively to Disney+ Hotstar. On the theatrical side, we have a robust slate debuting later this year, including the highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water, our newest animated film Strange World and the final film in Marvel's Phase 4, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Excitement for this film is amazing and the trailer received more than 170 million views in its first 24 hours.  Turning to sports. Our industry-leading run of rights acquisitions positions us extremely well for the future. We will continue to focus on audience expansion and long-term profitability by being disciplined in our acquisition approach and making deliberate distribution decisions for each sport in the portfolio. The results of this approach were fantastic last quarter, as the Walt Disney Company was responsible for 47% of sports hours watched by the 18 to 49 demo in fiscal Q3. Our innovative NHL deal has been a difference-maker across platforms with the Stanley Cup playoff viewership up 60% over 2021 across cable and broadcast including significant year-over-year increases in younger demos and female viewers. We also secured exclusive TV rights for the upcoming 2023 to 2027 IPL season following a competitive process where we make disciplined bids with a focus on long-term value.  We are excited to continue offering IPL to our linear customers in India where growth potential exists for our portfolio of more than 70 channels that reaches 90% of pay cable and satellite TV homes in the region. Pay TV distribution in India continues to be a robust business with projected GDP growth expected to drive advertising and consumer spending. In fact, India is one of the only markets in which we are launching new linear channels.  Finally given the results of our recently completed Upfront, it is clear that our unmatched portfolio continues to be highly sought after by advertisers. Combined with our deep expertise in ad tech we are in a position of strength with record Upfront advertiser commitment leading into the launch of our ad-supported Disney+ tier. Since the launch of Disney+ advertisers have been asking for the opportunity to connect with audiences alongside the most premium brands in content and streaming.  As we shared earlier today, the Disney+ ad tier goes live on December 8 and we are taking a thoughtful approach by launching with a lower ad load and frequency to ensure a great experience for viewers. This approach coupled with strong advertiser demand translated into Disney+ earning industry-leading CPM rates at the most recent upfront.  Turning to our parks. This quarter featured new magic around the world and strong operating performance. All of our theme parks are now open and we continue to bring back more of the great experience that guests love that includes Character Meet and Greet, Nighttime Spectacular at Disneyland and Theatrical Performances. These offerings are not only big hits with guests, but also enable us to welcome more people into our parks each day. We continue to see strong revenue and profit growth at our Domestic Parks and Experience businesses. Even as our cruise ships and international visitation have yet to fully recover domestic demand at our theme parks continues to be strong and we are seeing continued progress in those businesses still recovering from the pandemic. At the same time the business model transformation we have achieved over the past few years have driven substantial increases in per capita spending and give us the flexibility to adapt should economic conditions change. We celebrated three major milestones for our Parks and Experience business this quarter each of which were priorities I said when I had the opportunity to lead our Parks team. First, the innovative and immersive new roller coaster, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind opened an Epcot as part of the park's ongoing transformation to a place that is more family more timeless and more Disney. Second, we expanded the Disney Cruise Line fleet with a Disney Wish, which sailed its maiden voyage on July 14. This is the first of three new ships and is infused with Disney storytelling one-of-a-kind entertainment and a modern interior aesthetic. It is powered by liquefied natural gas one of the cleanest burning fuels available. And finally, Disneyland Paris opened Avengers Campus on July 20 completing the first phase of our ambitious expansion plan. The new immersive area features two new attractions, five action stunts encounters with Marvel superhero and theme restaurants. I had the opportunity to help open this new land with stars from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and our cast and I could not be more proud of the resort's ongoing transformation. Guests are responding in a big way to our enhanced offering at Disneyland Paris' per capita spending in Q3 was up over 30% versus 2019 a great sign of the site's potential for growth. I am incredibly pleased with our performance this quarter, our competitive position and the unique collection of assets and capabilities that sets us apart. Going forward, The Walt Disney Company's incredible employees cast members and creative teams will continue to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine. \nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong financial results this quarter with diluted earnings per share excluding certain items increasing to $1.09 versus $0.80 in the prior year quarter. At Parks, Experiences and Products, third quarter revenues increased by more than $3 billion and operating income increased by $1.8 billion versus the prior year reflecting improvements across both domestic and international parks and experiences. Demand at our domestic parks continues to exceed expectations with attendance on many days tracking ahead of 2019 levels. And our continued focus on improving the guest experience through the use of our reservation system to purposely manage capacity versus simply increasing volume has the added benefit of improving yield and optimizing overall economics. So even while the average daily attendance at our domestic parks across the first three quarters of this fiscal year was slightly below 2019, we have delivered significantly higher revenue and operating income over that same time period. This approach also provides flexibility with levers we can adjust if demand were to shift. Per capita spending at our domestic parks also remained strong increasing 10% versus Q3 of fiscal 2021 and over 40% versus fiscal 2019. And in another sign of the robust demand we have seen at our parks and resorts, occupancy at our domestic hotels in the third quarter was 90%. Looking ahead, domestic demand at our theme parks continues to look robust with current forward-looking hotel bookings and intent to visit roughly in line with pre-pandemic trends. Improvement at our international parks in the third quarter was driven by Disneyland Paris where both revenue and operating income exceeded 2019 levels. And we are seeing the same momentum well into Q4, as we continue to celebrate the 30th anniversary and the opening of Avengers Campus in July. Disneyland Paris' strong performance in the third quarter was partially offset by closure-related impacts at Shanghai Disney Resort, where the theme park was closed for all, but the last three days of the quarter. At the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, third quarter revenues increased by over $1.4 billion versus the prior year, and operating income decreased by $645 million, as an increase at linear networks was more than offset by declines at direct-to-consumer and content sales licensing and other. Linear Networks operating income in the quarter increased 13% to approximately $2.5 billion, driven primarily by growth at our Domestic Channels. The increase at Domestic Channels reflects double-digit percentage operating income growth, at both Cable and Broadcasting. Growth at Cable was largely driven by higher advertising revenue and to a lesser extent a decrease in marketing costs and an increase in affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at Cable benefited from the timing of the NBA Finals, which represented six of the top seven telecasts among the coveted P18 to 49 demo, across all networks this quarter. Note that the final aired in the third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. This timing impact in addition to the benefit of adding the NHL to our portfolio and strong pricing, from the continued strength of Live Sports, drove ESPN advertising revenue growth of nearly 40% year-over-year. Demand for Live Sports remains strong. However, due to the NBA Finals timing impact fourth quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing down. Moving on to Broadcasting. Operating income increased versus the prior year due to higher results at both ABC, and our owned television stations. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was driven by six points of growth from higher rates, partially offset by a three point decrease from fewer subscribers. International Channels' operating income was comparable to the prior year, reflecting increased sports programming costs, partially offset by advertising revenue growth. Both of these trends were driven by the airing of 35 additional IPL cricket matches in the third quarter versus the prior year. Note that, results also benefited from the closure of certain channels over the past year. At Direct-to-Consumer, lower operating results across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, reflect increased programming and production costs, in line with the guidance we gave last quarter, as we continue to strategically invest in our streaming businesses. At Disney+, we crossed the 150 million subscriber milestone and ended the third quarter with more than 152 million global paid subscribers a net addition of more than 14 million subs versus Q2. Strong Disney+ core net subscriber additions of six million reflect growth in existing markets as well as launches in over 50 new markets during the quarter, and we currently expect Disney+ core net additions in the fourth quarter to accelerate modestly versus Q3 and particularly in the domestic market. At Disney+ Hotstar subscribers increased by over eight million as the IPO concluded its 15th season in the quarter. Hulu added more than 600,000 subs during the quarter and ended the third quarter with 46.2 million paid subscribers and ESPN+ ended Q3 with 22.8 million paid subscribers, a net increase of about 0.5 million versus Q2. At content sales, licensing and other, operating results decreased in line with our expectations by about $160 million versus the prior year quarter, reflecting an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and lower TV, SVOD and home entertainment distribution results, partially offset by higher stage play and theatrical results. As it relates to foreign exchange, note that the overall impact to the company's segment operating income was only modestly negative in the quarter, as our FX hedging program continued to be effective in mitigating the impact that changes in exchange rates have on our businesses. As we continue to scale back on third party content licensing, we believe content sales, licensing and other results will continue to face headwinds and expect fourth quarter operating results will decrease versus the prior year by close to $100 million. Cash content spend across the company is now expected to total approximately $30 billion for fiscal 2022. This estimate is slightly lower than our previous guidance largely due to timing changes, and we expect annual cash content spend over the next couple of years to be roughly in the low $30 billion range as well. We are also revising our full year forecast for capital expenditures to $5 billion compared to fiscal 2021 CapEx of $3.6 billion. Our new expectation for 2022 is roughly $500 million lower than our previous guide, in part reflecting timing shifts of various projects across the company. Finally, before we move to Q&A, I want to spend some time sharing a few updates on our fiscal 2024 guidance for Disney+. We are providing more detail on subscriber targets by separating our guidance into two categories: core Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar. Excluding the impact of any significant future macro headwinds, our core Disney+ subscriber target range is 135 million to 165 million by the end of fiscal 2024, largely consistent with previously provided guidance that non-Hotstar Disney+ subscribers in 2024 would approximate 60% to 70% of the expected 230 million to 260 million total subscriber base. We are, however, updating subscriber guidance for Disney+ Hotstar to up to 80 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. We intend to refine this target over time as subscriber visibility in India will be clearer once the ICC and BCCI cricket rights sales processes are completed. As you may know we recently made the disciplined decision to not proceed with the Indian Premier League digital rights and we'll evaluate these rights with that same discipline. As we sit here today, we remain confident that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024 and look forward to several upcoming catalysts including reaching a steady state of tentpole original content releases, delivery of premium general entertainment and international local originals and the upcoming launch of our ad-supported tier alongside the new pricing structure announced earlier today. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia and we would be happy to take your questions.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks Christine. As we transition to Q&A, we ask you please limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many analysts as possible today. And with that operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. One question, there was so much to ask about. Why don't I go with this and I do appreciate you separating out the guidance between Hotstar and core Disney, but Parks were impressive this quarter. And as you talked about levers of demand were to shift, has the company satisfied pent-up demand from the pandemic at the Parks' point? Should we look at the go-forward basis is relatively normal trends? And I'm guessing you have a different answer for domestic versus international. And Christine I'd be curious if you'd put any meat on the bone regarding the levers if demand were to shift at the Parks? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. Thanks Doug. Our Parks certainly did have a fantastic quarter. And I just want to say that the parks team is the same team led by Josh D'Amaro that was able to manage through the COVID crisis that impacted the business significantly. They also were able to ramp back in on a very phased basis back to the recovery phase and they're now positioned for growth. So I just want to acknowledge that team for being a triple threat when it comes to being able to manage from very, very different vantage points based on the environment. As it relates to levers of demand some of the things we could do Doug we had limited the number of annual passes that we have across some of our businesses -- some of the Parks. And all of those come with some with the exception of the highest tiered priced annual passes. They all come with some blackout dates. So to the extent to which perhaps you had lightened demand, you could loosen up some of those to bring more people in the Park and just enjoy the Park and spend money while they're there. And also as it relates to demand we have not yet seen demand abate at all. And we still have many days when people cannot get reservations. So we're still seeing demand in excess of the reservations that we are making available for our guests.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Good afternoon. Bob can you talk a little bit about, sort of the research and insight you have into your streaming customer base that sort of informs the decision to take these price increases which on a percentage basis are pretty large, without really reducing net adds with from churn spiking as you implement these price increases? And maybe talk a little bit about, how the product that consumers will be paying for next year at these higher prices will compare to this year. And I'm just wondering are you planning to take similar pricing moves at least directionally outside the U.S. overtime? Thanks for the color.\nBob Chapek: Well, as you know, we launched at an extraordinarily compelling price across all the platforms that we have for streaming. I think it was easy to say that, we're probably the best value in streaming. And since that initial launch, we've continued to invest handsomely in our content as you know. We believe, because the increase in the investment over the past 2.5 years relative to a very good price point that we have plenty of room on price value. And we do not believe that there's going to be any meaningful long-term impact on our churn as a result. I mean, one only needs to look at our recent significant increase on ESPN+, which had the exact same impact of really no meaningful impact at all on our churn. And we believe that we've got plenty of price value room left to go.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. So the DPEP margins were really spectacular. I'm just wondering, what kind of trends you're seeing from international visitations. Were those strong in the quarter, or is that a tailwind to either per caps or hotel occupancy as you get into the back half of the year and you see more international traffic?\nChristine McCarthy: I'll take that one, Steve. The DPEP margins were indeed, very strong. One of the things that we've seen is, during the pandemic international visitation to our domestic park primarily Walt Disney World was basically non-existent. That has proceeded to come back and it has come back very nicely, but it is still below the traditional range that we've given you which is around 17% 18%, up to the low-20s. But it's made significant progress. And we expect the international visitation when it is fully back to actually be additive to margins, because those guests tend to stay longer at the parks and they spend more money when they're there as well.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thank you. I just wanted to dig a bit on the ad product at Disney+. What's your expectation for ad load or modernization per sub, given there's a $3 difference between the premium with no ads and the ad product? And maybe what you've learned from Hulu over the years, that informs your expectations on monetization. Thanks.\nBob Chapek: As you know, we've had a lot of experience with this on Hulu and a lot of success with this on Hulu. And we are walking before we run in terms of seeing what the market will bear in terms of an ad load. So we're going in very conservative upfront. But we believe that, there's probably going to be some more ultimate elasticity in that as well as we go forward. And we're just really thrilled that we're able to launch the Disney+ ad tier and expand our audience access through all these multiple price points that we're going to have. And as Christine had alluded to, the advertising demand since the launch of Disney+ is great. And we think that by taking a conservative approach in terms of that ad load upfront, it will give us the ability to expand if we need to and not have to go the other way, which I think would be a much bigger deal.\nChristine McCarthy: And the only other thing I'd add to that Michael is based on our Hulu experience that even current subscribers who have ad-free may choose to stay at the same price point with ads. The Hulu ad-supported tier has more subscribers than the ad-free. In fact, it's well over about \u2013 it's about two-third. And that's something that we can't anticipate that we'd have exactly the same behavior because it's a different demo that has Disney+ versus Hulu but that's the best indication that we have. But we expect the ad tier to be popular and we also expect some people to want to stay with ad-free.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: And that question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Maybe switching gears a little bit to sports. Can you give us your thoughts on what the structure of an NBA renewal might look like? Would it be different? And in the past you've mentioned participating in sports betting. You have the best brand name. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on timing of what you're thinking? And then just a follow-up to some of the comments. Just on \u2013 you launched a new cruise ship. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of cruise demand overall? \nBob Chapek: I think you want to divide yourself. Okay. I'll talk about the MBA first. As you know, we've had a great history with the NBA, really proud of our partnership there. And the past season and the ratings for the finals have been absolutely extraordinary. So we're interested in a renewal with the NBA. But like all of our decisions that we make in terms of content, we'll only do it if it's accretive to shareholder value. And I think that remains the overall guidance, whether you're talking about India with IPL, whether you're talking about college sports, whether you're talking about Formula 1 racing or you're talking about NBA. So we have an interest to do that. We're really happy with our portfolio of sports rights that we have. But of course, the continued relationship with the NBA would be something that would be very attractive to us.\nChristine McCarthy: Do you want to take sports betting? \nBob Chapek: Yes. Well, in terms of sports betting we are \u2013 have been in conversations for quite a long time now with a number of different platforms to add some utility to sports betting and take away some friction for that for our guests. We have found that basically our sports fans that are under 30 absolutely require this type of utility in the overall portfolio of what ESPN offers. So we think it's important. We're working hard on it, and we hope to have something to announce in the future in terms of a partnership there that will allow us to access that revenue stream and also make sure that our guests are being \u2013 having their needs met.\nChristine McCarthy: So Jessica on cruise. As you know, we welcomed our fifth ship to our four ship fleet, so we now have five. The new ship goes by the name of Wish, as Bob mentioned, and it's quite an extraordinary vessel. But we've always said that that business has been the most severely impacted by COVID in terms of duration of disruption to the business. So we're still coming out of that, but we are focused on the business recovering. Historically, the cruise line has been terrific with really attractive ROICs for us and it's generated double-digit returns on the investment. And we expect that business to come back to the similarly attractive returns that we had previously experienced. And a couple of things. The WISH is our newest ship and that has gone with very, very high capacity. And that one it's just very well received. But we have a competitive position overall in the cruise business, especially the family cruise market. So we generate pricing that's well above the industry average. And our cruise ships deliver for us one of the highest rated guest experiences across all of our parks and experiences offerings. And this is a really interesting comment that we received from our cruise passengers. 40% of them say that they would not have chosen to go on a cruise vacation if it weren't a Disney Cruise. So we're a unique product and we're still a relatively small share of the cruise market and we're positioned for growth. And the other four ships are all sailing and their occupancy is improving week by week.\nAlexia Quadrani: Next question please.\nOperator: Next question is from Kutgun Maral from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKutgun Maral: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. One on the parks and then a follow-up on FX if I could. First, the parks are going through a particularly innovative and transformative period given your investments in technology, digital tools and improvements in the guest experience. So from the outside, it seems that the business is as well positioned as it's ever been in the face of a potential recession. But I'd love to get your views on the various sensitivities associated with what the consumer is seeing and how you'd characterize the resiliency of the business. I know you talked about different levers at your disposal, but perhaps there's been a structural change in the business compared to prior recessionary periods that you could speak to? And then Christine, if I could follow up on your foreign exchange commentary. Can you share a bit more on how you manage your FX risk? And what was the impact of FX on DTC ARPU? Thank you.\nBob Chapek: Yeah. I think a lot of onlookers look at our park business and try to sum up our success recently and say that it has something to do with pent-up demand. And certainly, there is pent-up demand. But what we're seeing is far more resilient, far more long lasting in terms of increase in the affinity for our parks both from the willingness to come to our parks and its attendance, but also in terms of what guests are willing to spend when they get there in order to personalize their experience. As you know, everything we do in our parks is all about improving the guest experience. And part of that has to do with limiting capacity, but also about personalizing those experiences. So we believe we do have a lot of flexibility to shift, if our demand changes. Remember, we have a reservation system which now enables us essentially real time on the fly to change whatever factors we need in terms of our ticket packaging that we want where years ago we didn't have that. We published our prices by the quarter and that was essentially all the flexibility we had. But as you know our business looks very strong with forward-looking bookings and intent at pre-pandemic levels and we see nothing in the future that's indicating anything to the contrary of what we've seen. So we're very pleased with that. I should also remind you that our reservation system really does a great job at spreading demand. So if we see any spikiness, we can actually smooth that in a way that we couldn't before. And we're real pleased with that because even our Genie product, which as you know we released just a little bit short of a year ago, now about 50% of the people that come through the gate, actually buy up to that Genie product which I think you can see the result of in our yields. \nChristine McCarthy: And I'll take the question on foreign exchange and the way we hedge. So, we do have a hedging policy that is well established and has really served the company well over very volatile foreign exchange markets. So, just level set, we have a program and the goal of it is to reduce the impact that changes in foreign exchange rates have on our current and future earnings. So, we really have an objective of trying to attain earnings and cash flow stability and predictability. So, we try to take out the ups and the downs. So, the hedging program it has significantly reduced the negative earnings impact of the strong dollar that we've seen both in the third quarter as well as the fiscal year-to-date. And so despite being economically hedged as it relates to ARPU, we do not allocate the hedge gains or losses specifically to ARPU in the various markets. So, therefore, the reported ARPU for international Disney+ was impacted by the unfavorable exchange rates in the quarter. Another thing is when you look at content sales and licensing, especially if you go back and look at the transcript, you'll note that there was a reference to that also being impacted by negative foreign exchange. That was just a balance sheet ineffectiveness. We also hedge the balance sheet. And that had to do more with we based our hedging on forecasted plans. And if the plans come in stronger and were underhedged or overhedged, in this case we were it did not benefit us because we were hedged the right way for the dollar strengthening, but that is a one-timer that should not be repeated. But as it relates to ARPU, if you have some volatility, you will see it in the ARPU, but it nets out as a company overall. As I mentioned in my other comments that this is not a material item for us on a consolidated basis. You just saw it spike out, especially in DMED. And the other thing is we do hedging on a multiyear basis. So, we layer in our hedges over a period of time, which has really served us well in the current environment. \nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: And the next question is from in Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So, maybe Bob from a strategic perspective, when you think about sports, it does seem like that there are a lot of new entrants. I mean Apple seems to be interested in more and more sports rates. And from your perspective, you obviously walked away from the cricket rights in India and it looks like Big 10 may also be going in a different direction. So, when you think about sports strategically, given that cord cutting is structural, how do you think about this business longer term? Do you really have to own ESPN or get into sports streaming in a much bigger way or invest a lot more? I mean directionally, they are off of it obviously from a decision perspective. So, it would be great to get a sense for how you're thinking about sports more broadly? And then on the advertising side, if I could just ask a bigger picture question around Disney+. From a subscriber base perspective, Disney+ is comparable domestically to Hulu and US is the biggest ad market when it comes to the television opportunity. So when we think about the scale of advertising for Disney+, is Hulu the kind of benchmark we should be thinking about, or can Disney+ be much bigger because it is international in scale all those CPMs are much lower outside the US? So if you could just help us scale that opportunity that would be great? Thanks.\nBob Chapek : Okay. In terms of the strategy on sports, we're continually enamored by the power sports in terms of viewership and what it adds to our overall portfolio particularly in an advertising type world. As you know, we get strong cash flows on linear and it helps to pay some of the bills in the companies we make some of our significant investments in content, and we also like the proposition of growth and expansion on our DTC.. In terms of the rights, if you look at the college rights, we've got the SEC, we've got the ACC, we've got the Pac-12. We've got the Big 12. We've got the play off. We've got the most comprehensive programming. So if we don't get rights in every single conference, we don't believe that's in any way limiting for us. But what we're all preparing for is the future of what ESPN would look like in a direct-to-consumer -- in a true direct-to-consumer fashion. And I think the way that we're looking at this is that we want to proactively prepare for that future without prematurely disrupting the cash flow that we get from the linear networks right now. And as you know we've negotiated flexibility into our rights agreements across the board for any new rights that we have acquired over the last several years, but we're still bullish on sports. We believe there's tremendous degrees of freedom in terms of what ESPN DTC ultimately looks like. I think we're very proud of what we've done to-date on ESPN+, but that no way limits how we envision what true ESPN DTC proposition would look like going into the future. \nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Kannan. Thank you for asking this question about advertising. I know there's been a lot written recently about ad trends. But I just want to start off by saying pacing in our scatter market continues to be solid across streaming sports, as well as our broadcast network. Now to get to your question about Disney+ AVOD and the scale, first of all, we are going to launch later this year, as Bob said, December 8. And we're taking an intentionally limited approach to it, meaning, we're launching with a lower ad load and a lower frequency than say Hulu. And so this will ensure a great experience for viewers, and these viewers are different then, because a lot of them are families and you have a lot of adults at Hulu, but it's a different viewing experience. But because of that disciplined lower ad load, lower frequency and the strong advertising, demand that we've had that translates into some of the industry-leading CPM rates at the most recent upfront for Disney+. And then we look at beyond domestic, what we can do internationally, and we plan to go international sometime next year. And we've built these strong advertising relationships around the world with our previously existing and currently existing linear footprint. So we're confident in our ability to navigate the international advertising marketplace given our depth of knowledge and experience with the traditional linear business. So, we really feel well suited to deliver both domestically on Disney+ AVOD, as well as international.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: And that question is from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hi. Thank you. One and a follow-up on DTC. First, Christine, there were higher DTC and Disney+ programming costs than we expected this quarter. Can you give us some direction of where to go in the fourth quarter? And when should we expect those Disney+ operating income losses to peak? And then second, if you could dig into the guidance to acceleration of subs in the fourth quarter. I think that's an acceleration in the total subs and then you set a higher mix of growth toward domestic? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Let me start first with the acceleration of subs. I did mention that that we expect acceleration of subs to be -- especially in the domestic market to be modestly above where we are now. But you will see growth in Q4 and we feel good about that because of the content releases we have and just the existing shows that are on. Peak losses, we expect peak losses -- as of today, we expect Disney+ to reach peak losses in this current fiscal year '22. So that is something that is consistent with what we've previously said. As it relates to higher costs of content and programming, we have said that, we have -- this is a peak year of losses which includes those costs. But also, we expect as we go into developing our full slate that the next quarter you will see a similar increase year-over-year that you saw this quarter.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: And that question is from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Hi. Thanks. And if you don't mind I'd like to follow up with the question about the ad experience on Disney+. And it's only two things, I was hoping you could comment on. The first is, would you expect to potentially display ads alongside any of the content? Some of that content including some of the kids' content I think historically in a linear world didn't necessarily have ads alongside of it. So I'm just thinking about that element of it. And then secondly, you have a competitor that's looking to layer advertising into their product, they're suggesting that, they're going to somehow do it differently. And I'm just curious, as you think about the experience you've had in streaming advertising. Are you mostly going to look to leverage the formats you've used very successfully with Hulu, or do you actually think there may be an opportunity to use some innovative new formats on Disney+ for ads? Thank you.\nBob Chapek: I should say that the technology for Disney+ is a completely different platform than the Hulu platform. So, while we certainly have tremendous learnings over the years, in terms of how to do addressable advertising and we've done that at the advantage of our shareholders' result. I will have to say that, we are not encumbered by that or in any way limited by what we've done in the past. Therefore, we could have an ad proposition as good as the one that we've had on Hulu, but it could actually be better because of that different technology platform. So, it has the ability to evolve over time much more on the new platform than it does in the old platform.\nChristine McCarthy: And as it relates to the ad experience Brett, it's not all content on Disney+ being treated equally. There will be no ads in kid's profiles or preschool at least at the launch. And so this is going to be done very thoughtfully and looking at the content and also making sure that the advertiser is consistent with the content.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Sure. And that question is from Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good afternoon. Christine there's been a heavy working capital use year-to-date in fiscal 2022 both from cash content cost as well as what we traditionally think about as working capital. Can you just talk about your outlook for the rest of the year and the prospects for some of that reversing in 4Q and to next year? And then I was wondering if you could also comment briefly just on tax. I think you've had an elevated tax rate this year. You talked about it last quarter. Is that something that's going to extend into 2023? And if you could just provide any color around what some of the factors are driving that? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. So on working capital, we have seen net working capital outflows as our businesses are getting back up and running and going back to more normalized operations after they were turned down during the pandemic. And you'll see in this quarter, we did generate positive free cash flow of $187 million in the quarter. On taxes, our effective -- annual effective tax rate has generally been correlated with the US statutory rate. But there are a lot of things on a quarterly basis. We call them puts and takes in any given period. And these can lead to these quarterly variances. But we still expect our full year 2022 tax rate is going to be somewhat elevated above the US statutory rate similar to what you saw. And for Q4 it could even be slightly above Q3. As it relates to fiscal 2023, we're just working now through our annual operating plan. And I don't want to get too specific today but it's one of the factors we keep a close eye on as it relates to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits. And that ability to utilize foreign tax credits has been the source of some volatility that you've seen especially in Q2 tax rate.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thanks for the question. I want to thank everybody for joining us as well. And for your convenience we will be posting the pricing schedule and updated content slate on our website.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong financial results this quarter with diluted earnings per share excluding certain items increasing to $1.09 versus $0.80 in the prior year quarter. At Parks, Experiences and Products, third quarter revenues increased by more than $3 billion and operating income increased by $1.8 billion versus the prior year reflecting improvements across both domestic and international parks and experiences. Demand at our domestic parks continues to exceed expectations with attendance on many days tracking ahead of 2019 levels. And our continued focus on improving the guest experience through the use of our reservation system to purposely manage capacity versus simply increasing volume has the added benefit of improving yield and optimizing overall economics. So even while the average daily attendance at our domestic parks across the first three quarters of this fiscal year was slightly below 2019, we have delivered significantly higher revenue and operating income over that same time period. This approach also provides flexibility with levers we can adjust if demand were to shift. Per capita spending at our domestic parks also remained strong increasing 10% versus Q3 of fiscal 2021 and over 40% versus fiscal 2019. And in another sign of the robust demand we have seen at our parks and resorts, occupancy at our domestic hotels in the third quarter was 90%. Looking ahead, domestic demand at our theme parks continues to look robust with current forward-looking hotel bookings and intent to visit roughly in line with pre-pandemic trends. Improvement at our international parks in the third quarter was driven by Disneyland Paris where both revenue and operating income exceeded 2019 levels. And we are seeing the same momentum well into Q4, as we continue to celebrate the 30th anniversary and the opening of Avengers Campus in July. Disneyland Paris' strong performance in the third quarter was partially offset by closure-related impacts at Shanghai Disney Resort, where the theme park was closed for all, but the last three days of the quarter. At the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, third quarter revenues increased by over $1.4 billion versus the prior year, and operating income decreased by $645 million, as an increase at linear networks was more than offset by declines at direct-to-consumer and content sales licensing and other. Linear Networks operating income in the quarter increased 13% to approximately $2.5 billion, driven primarily by growth at our Domestic Channels. The increase at Domestic Channels reflects double-digit percentage operating income growth, at both Cable and Broadcasting. Growth at Cable was largely driven by higher advertising revenue and to a lesser extent a decrease in marketing costs and an increase in affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at Cable benefited from the timing of the NBA Finals, which represented six of the top seven telecasts among the coveted P18 to 49 demo, across all networks this quarter. Note that the final aired in the third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. This timing impact in addition to the benefit of adding the NHL to our portfolio and strong pricing, from the continued strength of Live Sports, drove ESPN advertising revenue growth of nearly 40% year-over-year. Demand for Live Sports remains strong. However, due to the NBA Finals timing impact fourth quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing down. Moving on to Broadcasting. Operating income increased versus the prior year due to higher results at both ABC, and our owned television stations. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was driven by six points of growth from higher rates, partially offset by a three point decrease from fewer subscribers. International Channels' operating income was comparable to the prior year, reflecting increased sports programming costs, partially offset by advertising revenue growth. Both of these trends were driven by the airing of 35 additional IPL cricket matches in the third quarter versus the prior year. Note that, results also benefited from the closure of certain channels over the past year. At Direct-to-Consumer, lower operating results across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, reflect increased programming and production costs, in line with the guidance we gave last quarter, as we continue to strategically invest in our streaming businesses. At Disney+, we crossed the 150 million subscriber milestone and ended the third quarter with more than 152 million global paid subscribers a net addition of more than 14 million subs versus Q2. Strong Disney+ core net subscriber additions of six million reflect growth in existing markets as well as launches in over 50 new markets during the quarter, and we currently expect Disney+ core net additions in the fourth quarter to accelerate modestly versus Q3 and particularly in the domestic market. At Disney+ Hotstar subscribers increased by over eight million as the IPO concluded its 15th season in the quarter. Hulu added more than 600,000 subs during the quarter and ended the third quarter with 46.2 million paid subscribers and ESPN+ ended Q3 with 22.8 million paid subscribers, a net increase of about 0.5 million versus Q2. At content sales, licensing and other, operating results decreased in line with our expectations by about $160 million versus the prior year quarter, reflecting an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and lower TV, SVOD and home entertainment distribution results, partially offset by higher stage play and theatrical results. As it relates to foreign exchange, note that the overall impact to the company's segment operating income was only modestly negative in the quarter, as our FX hedging program continued to be effective in mitigating the impact that changes in exchange rates have on our businesses. As we continue to scale back on third party content licensing, we believe content sales, licensing and other results will continue to face headwinds and expect fourth quarter operating results will decrease versus the prior year by close to $100 million. Cash content spend across the company is now expected to total approximately $30 billion for fiscal 2022. This estimate is slightly lower than our previous guidance largely due to timing changes, and we expect annual cash content spend over the next couple of years to be roughly in the low $30 billion range as well. We are also revising our full year forecast for capital expenditures to $5 billion compared to fiscal 2021 CapEx of $3.6 billion. Our new expectation for 2022 is roughly $500 million lower than our previous guide, in part reflecting timing shifts of various projects across the company. Finally, before we move to Q&A, I want to spend some time sharing a few updates on our fiscal 2024 guidance for Disney+. We are providing more detail on subscriber targets by separating our guidance into two categories: core Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar. Excluding the impact of any significant future macro headwinds, our core Disney+ subscriber target range is 135 million to 165 million by the end of fiscal 2024, largely consistent with previously provided guidance that non-Hotstar Disney+ subscribers in 2024 would approximate 60% to 70% of the expected 230 million to 260 million total subscriber base. We are, however, updating subscriber guidance for Disney+ Hotstar to up to 80 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. We intend to refine this target over time as subscriber visibility in India will be clearer once the ICC and BCCI cricket rights sales processes are completed. As you may know we recently made the disciplined decision to not proceed with the Indian Premier League digital rights and we'll evaluate these rights with that same discipline. As we sit here today, we remain confident that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024 and look forward to several upcoming catalysts including reaching a steady state of tentpole original content releases, delivery of premium general entertainment and international local originals and the upcoming launch of our ad-supported tier alongside the new pricing structure announced earlier today. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia and we would be happy to take your questions. Sure. Thanks Doug. Our Parks certainly did have a fantastic quarter. And I just want to say that the parks team is the same team led by Josh D'Amaro that was able to manage through the COVID crisis that impacted the business significantly. They also were able to ramp back in on a very phased basis back to the recovery phase and they're now positioned for growth. So I just want to acknowledge that team for being a triple threat when it comes to being able to manage from very, very different vantage points based on the environment. As it relates to levers of demand some of the things we could do Doug we had limited the number of annual passes that we have across some of our businesses -- some of the Parks. And all of those come with some with the exception of the highest tiered priced annual passes. They all come with some blackout dates. So to the extent to which perhaps you had lightened demand, you could loosen up some of those to bring more people in the Park and just enjoy the Park and spend money while they're there. And also as it relates to demand we have not yet seen demand abate at all. And we still have many days when people cannot get reservations. So we're still seeing demand in excess of the reservations that we are making available for our guests. I'll take that one, Steve. The DPEP margins were indeed, very strong. One of the things that we've seen is, during the pandemic international visitation to our domestic park primarily Walt Disney World was basically non-existent. That has proceeded to come back and it has come back very nicely, but it is still below the traditional range that we've given you which is around 17% 18%, up to the low-20s. But it's made significant progress. And we expect the international visitation when it is fully back to actually be additive to margins, because those guests tend to stay longer at the parks and they spend more money when they're there as well. And the only other thing I'd add to that Michael is based on our Hulu experience that even current subscribers who have ad-free may choose to stay at the same price point with ads. The Hulu ad-supported tier has more subscribers than the ad-free. In fact, it's well over about \u2013 it's about two-third. And that's something that we can't anticipate that we'd have exactly the same behavior because it's a different demo that has Disney+ versus Hulu but that's the best indication that we have. But we expect the ad tier to be popular and we also expect some people to want to stay with ad-free. Do you want to take sports betting? So Jessica on cruise. As you know, we welcomed our fifth ship to our four ship fleet, so we now have five. The new ship goes by the name of Wish, as Bob mentioned, and it's quite an extraordinary vessel. But we've always said that that business has been the most severely impacted by COVID in terms of duration of disruption to the business. So we're still coming out of that, but we are focused on the business recovering. Historically, the cruise line has been terrific with really attractive ROICs for us and it's generated double-digit returns on the investment. And we expect that business to come back to the similarly attractive returns that we had previously experienced. And a couple of things. The WISH is our newest ship and that has gone with very, very high capacity. And that one it's just very well received. But we have a competitive position overall in the cruise business, especially the family cruise market. So we generate pricing that's well above the industry average. And our cruise ships deliver for us one of the highest rated guest experiences across all of our parks and experiences offerings. And this is a really interesting comment that we received from our cruise passengers. 40% of them say that they would not have chosen to go on a cruise vacation if it weren't a Disney Cruise. So we're a unique product and we're still a relatively small share of the cruise market and we're positioned for growth. And the other four ships are all sailing and their occupancy is improving week by week. And I'll take the question on foreign exchange and the way we hedge. So, we do have a hedging policy that is well established and has really served the company well over very volatile foreign exchange markets. So, just level set, we have a program and the goal of it is to reduce the impact that changes in foreign exchange rates have on our current and future earnings. So, we really have an objective of trying to attain earnings and cash flow stability and predictability. So, we try to take out the ups and the downs. So, the hedging program it has significantly reduced the negative earnings impact of the strong dollar that we've seen both in the third quarter as well as the fiscal year-to-date. And so despite being economically hedged as it relates to ARPU, we do not allocate the hedge gains or losses specifically to ARPU in the various markets. So, therefore, the reported ARPU for international Disney+ was impacted by the unfavorable exchange rates in the quarter. Another thing is when you look at content sales and licensing, especially if you go back and look at the transcript, you'll note that there was a reference to that also being impacted by negative foreign exchange. That was just a balance sheet ineffectiveness. We also hedge the balance sheet. And that had to do more with we based our hedging on forecasted plans. And if the plans come in stronger and were underhedged or overhedged, in this case we were it did not benefit us because we were hedged the right way for the dollar strengthening, but that is a one-timer that should not be repeated. But as it relates to ARPU, if you have some volatility, you will see it in the ARPU, but it nets out as a company overall. As I mentioned in my other comments that this is not a material item for us on a consolidated basis. You just saw it spike out, especially in DMED. And the other thing is we do hedging on a multiyear basis. So, we layer in our hedges over a period of time, which has really served us well in the current environment. Hi, Kannan. Thank you for asking this question about advertising. I know there's been a lot written recently about ad trends. But I just want to start off by saying pacing in our scatter market continues to be solid across streaming sports, as well as our broadcast network. Now to get to your question about Disney+ AVOD and the scale, first of all, we are going to launch later this year, as Bob said, December 8. And we're taking an intentionally limited approach to it, meaning, we're launching with a lower ad load and a lower frequency than say Hulu.

And then we look at beyond domestic, what we can do internationally, and we plan to go international sometime next year. And we've built these strong advertising relationships around the world with our previously existing and currently existing linear footprint. So we're confident in our ability to navigate the international advertising marketplace given our depth of knowledge and experience with the traditional linear business. So, we really feel well suited to deliver both domestically on Disney+ AVOD, as well as international. Okay. Let me start first with the acceleration of subs. I did mention that that we expect acceleration of subs to be -- especially in the domestic market to be modestly above where we are now. But you will see growth in Q4 and we feel good about that because of the content releases we have and just the existing shows that are on. Peak losses, we expect peak losses -- as of today, we expect Disney+ to reach peak losses in this current fiscal year '22. So that is something that is consistent with what we've previously said. As it relates to higher costs of content and programming, we have said that, we have -- this is a peak year of losses which includes those costs. But also, we expect as we go into developing our full slate that the next quarter you will see a similar increase year-over-year that you saw this quarter. And as it relates to the ad experience Brett, it's not all content on Disney+ being treated equally. There will be no ads in kid's profiles or preschool at least at the launch. And so this is going to be done very thoughtfully and looking at the content and also making sure that the advertiser is consistent with the content. Sure. So on working capital, we have seen net working capital outflows as our businesses are getting back up and running and going back to more normalized operations after they were turned down during the pandemic. And you'll see in this quarter, we did generate positive free cash flow of $187 million in the quarter.

As it relates to fiscal 2023, we're just working now through our annual operating plan. And I don't want to get too specific today but it's one of the factors we keep a close eye on as it relates to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits. And that ability to utilize foreign tax credits has been the source of some volatility that you've seen especially in Q2 tax rate."

            "name": "Bob Chapek",
            "content": "Thank you, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. We had an excellent quarter powered by world-class storytelling, outstanding performance at our domestic theme parks, increases in live sports viewership across our linear channels and ESPN+ and significant subscriber growth at our streaming services which added 15.5 million subscriptions in the quarter, including 14.4 million Disney+ subscribers, of which 6 million were core Disney+ and 8 million were Hotstar. As of the close of Q3, we now have 221 million total subscriptions across our streaming offerings. Our results showcase the ability of The Walt Disney Company's uniquely diversified business to power our ecosystems and explore growth opportunities across industries and distributions channels. I'll expand on all this and more and then Christine will go through the details of our results and provide additional insight into our fiscal 2024 expectations for Disney+. Creative excellence in storytelling that builds deep emotional connections with audiences is at the root of our success. And I am pleased to say that our creative engines are firing on all cylinders across franchise, general entertainment and sports. In a testament to the depth, breadth and quality of our creative teams, we received 147 Primetime Emmy award nominations this year, including 92 for our streaming platforms and 21 for best program in a genre, recognition across formats and distribution channels with 47 different shows receiving nominations, including titles like Only Murders in the Building. Abbott Elementary, What We Do in the Shadows and The Dropout, right alongside shows from Disney, Marvel and Star Wars. And most recently, we received an additional 71 news and documentary Emmy nominations across ABC News, National Geographic, FX, Hulu and ESPN. In addition to critical and industry recognition, we are thrilled by the audience response to our general entertainment offerings, response that is enhanced by a distribution strategy that maximizes reach by taking advantage of the strength of both our linear and streaming channels. Given the multiple ways, we bring our content to audiences, we take a thoughtful approach to each distribution decision to determine the best strategy for each of our many high-quality titles and platforms. Some like the Buzz-Generating Candy, the Kardashians and The Bear may be best served as Hulu originals. Others like Abbott Elementary and The Old Man have become multiplatform hits by reaching different audience demographics, across both linear and streaming. And when it comes to our key franchise content, I could not be more proud of the teams at Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. The hugely successful, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has earned nearly $1 billion at the global box office. And Thor: Love and Thunder, which premiered on July 8 has grossed over $700 million at the global box office and is the highest domestic grossing film of the Thor franchise. Pixar's Lightyear, marked the studios return to the big screen and the film debuted on Disney+ last week. Speaking of Disney+, which is now available in 155 markets after recently launching in 53 new territories, we released content with appeal across demographic groups including Obi-wan Kenobi and Ms. Marvel, as well as feature films like Disney's Chip n' Dale: Rescue Rangers and Disney Nature's: Polar Bear. As you know Disney+ is still a young business and we are learning more every day about the services ability to attract new fans to our powerhouse franchises. For example, in addition to driving engagement amongst tens of millions of existing Marvel fans, we have seen each new Disney+ original Marvel series, attract incremental viewership and new subscribers that hadn't previously engaged with Marvel content on the service, thanks to the episodic format that enables us to explore new characters and genres. The value of expanding the fan base is tremendous, and this new audience can then experience Marvel across our other offerings from consumer products to games to theme parks. Looking ahead Q4, will feature a fantastic Disney+ content slate, with the steady flow of key releases including Marvel's, She-Hulk, Attorney at Law, Lucas Films' Andor and Disney's Hocus Pocus 2 and we look forward to celebrating the second annual Disney+ Day on September 8 with activations across our synergy machine. Given the global nature of Disney+, we are thrilled to bring international music sensation BTS to the service, with an exclusive cinematic concert film and docuseries following the band's incredible journey. BTS and the K-Pop genre at large, carry massive global appeal and affinity, which will further extend our reach into that global fan base.  And we continue to step up our investment in international local originals, across formats including bringing the seventh season of Coffee With Karan, one of India's most popular talk shows exclusively to Disney+ Hotstar. On the theatrical side, we have a robust slate debuting later this year, including the highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water, our newest animated film Strange World and the final film in Marvel's Phase 4, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Excitement for this film is amazing and the trailer received more than 170 million views in its first 24 hours.  Turning to sports. Our industry-leading run of rights acquisitions positions us extremely well for the future. We will continue to focus on audience expansion and long-term profitability by being disciplined in our acquisition approach and making deliberate distribution decisions for each sport in the portfolio. The results of this approach were fantastic last quarter, as the Walt Disney Company was responsible for 47% of sports hours watched by the 18 to 49 demo in fiscal Q3. Our innovative NHL deal has been a difference-maker across platforms with the Stanley Cup playoff viewership up 60% over 2021 across cable and broadcast including significant year-over-year increases in younger demos and female viewers. We also secured exclusive TV rights for the upcoming 2023 to 2027 IPL season following a competitive process where we make disciplined bids with a focus on long-term value.  We are excited to continue offering IPL to our linear customers in India where growth potential exists for our portfolio of more than 70 channels that reaches 90% of pay cable and satellite TV homes in the region. Pay TV distribution in India continues to be a robust business with projected GDP growth expected to drive advertising and consumer spending. In fact, India is one of the only markets in which we are launching new linear channels.  Finally given the results of our recently completed Upfront, it is clear that our unmatched portfolio continues to be highly sought after by advertisers. Combined with our deep expertise in ad tech we are in a position of strength with record Upfront advertiser commitment leading into the launch of our ad-supported Disney+ tier. Since the launch of Disney+ advertisers have been asking for the opportunity to connect with audiences alongside the most premium brands in content and streaming.  As we shared earlier today, the Disney+ ad tier goes live on December 8 and we are taking a thoughtful approach by launching with a lower ad load and frequency to ensure a great experience for viewers. This approach coupled with strong advertiser demand translated into Disney+ earning industry-leading CPM rates at the most recent upfront.  Turning to our parks. This quarter featured new magic around the world and strong operating performance. All of our theme parks are now open and we continue to bring back more of the great experience that guests love that includes Character Meet and Greet, Nighttime Spectacular at Disneyland and Theatrical Performances. These offerings are not only big hits with guests, but also enable us to welcome more people into our parks each day. We continue to see strong revenue and profit growth at our Domestic Parks and Experience businesses. Even as our cruise ships and international visitation have yet to fully recover domestic demand at our theme parks continues to be strong and we are seeing continued progress in those businesses still recovering from the pandemic. At the same time the business model transformation we have achieved over the past few years have driven substantial increases in per capita spending and give us the flexibility to adapt should economic conditions change. We celebrated three major milestones for our Parks and Experience business this quarter each of which were priorities I said when I had the opportunity to lead our Parks team. First, the innovative and immersive new roller coaster, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind opened an Epcot as part of the park's ongoing transformation to a place that is more family more timeless and more Disney. Second, we expanded the Disney Cruise Line fleet with a Disney Wish, which sailed its maiden voyage on July 14. This is the first of three new ships and is infused with Disney storytelling one-of-a-kind entertainment and a modern interior aesthetic. It is powered by liquefied natural gas one of the cleanest burning fuels available. And finally, Disneyland Paris opened Avengers Campus on July 20 completing the first phase of our ambitious expansion plan. The new immersive area features two new attractions, five action stunts encounters with Marvel superhero and theme restaurants. I had the opportunity to help open this new land with stars from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and our cast and I could not be more proud of the resort's ongoing transformation. Guests are responding in a big way to our enhanced offering at Disneyland Paris' per capita spending in Q3 was up over 30% versus 2019 a great sign of the site's potential for growth. I am incredibly pleased with our performance this quarter, our competitive position and the unique collection of assets and capabilities that sets us apart. Going forward, The Walt Disney Company's incredible employees cast members and creative teams will continue to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine. Well, as you know, we launched at an extraordinarily compelling price across all the platforms that we have for streaming. I think it was easy to say that, we're probably the best value in streaming. And since that initial launch, we've continued to invest handsomely in our content as you know. We believe, because the increase in the investment over the past 2.5 years relative to a very good price point that we have plenty of room on price value. And we do not believe that there's going to be any meaningful long-term impact on our churn as a result. I mean, one only needs to look at our recent significant increase on ESPN+, which had the exact same impact of really no meaningful impact at all on our churn. And we believe that we've got plenty of price value room left to go. As you know, we've had a lot of experience with this on Hulu and a lot of success with this on Hulu. And we are walking before we run in terms of seeing what the market will bear in terms of an ad load. So we're going in very conservative upfront. But we believe that, there's probably going to be some more ultimate elasticity in that as well as we go forward. And we're just really thrilled that we're able to launch the Disney+ ad tier and expand our audience access through all these multiple price points that we're going to have. And as Christine had alluded to, the advertising demand since the launch of Disney+ is great. And we think that by taking a conservative approach in terms of that ad load upfront, it will give us the ability to expand if we need to and not have to go the other way, which I think would be a much bigger deal. I think you want to divide yourself. Okay. I'll talk about the MBA first. As you know, we've had a great history with the NBA, really proud of our partnership there. And the past season and the ratings for the finals have been absolutely extraordinary. So we're interested in a renewal with the NBA. But like all of our decisions that we make in terms of content, we'll only do it if it's accretive to shareholder value. And I think that remains the overall guidance, whether you're talking about India with IPL, whether you're talking about college sports, whether you're talking about Formula 1 racing or you're talking about NBA. So we have an interest to do that. We're really happy with our portfolio of sports rights that we have. But of course, the continued relationship with the NBA would be something that would be very attractive to us. Yes. Well, in terms of sports betting we are \u2013 have been in conversations for quite a long time now with a number of different platforms to add some utility to sports betting and take away some friction for that for our guests. We have found that basically our sports fans that are under 30 absolutely require this type of utility in the overall portfolio of what ESPN offers. So we think it's important. We're working hard on it, and we hope to have something to announce in the future in terms of a partnership there that will allow us to access that revenue stream and also make sure that our guests are being \u2013 having their needs met. Yeah. I think a lot of onlookers look at our park business and try to sum up our success recently and say that it has something to do with pent-up demand. And certainly, there is pent-up demand. But what we're seeing is far more resilient, far more long lasting in terms of increase in the affinity for our parks both from the willingness to come to our parks and its attendance, but also in terms of what guests are willing to spend when they get there in order to personalize their experience. As you know, everything we do in our parks is all about improving the guest experience. And part of that has to do with limiting capacity, but also about personalizing those experiences. So we believe we do have a lot of flexibility to shift, if our demand changes. Remember, we have a reservation system which now enables us essentially real time on the fly to change whatever factors we need in terms of our ticket packaging that we want where years ago we didn't have that. We published our prices by the quarter and that was essentially all the flexibility we had. But as you know our business looks very strong with forward-looking bookings and intent at pre-pandemic levels and we see nothing in the future that's indicating anything to the contrary of what we've seen. So we're very pleased with that. I should also remind you that our reservation system really does a great job at spreading demand. So if we see any spikiness, we can actually smooth that in a way that we couldn't before. And we're real pleased with that because even our Genie product, which as you know we released just a little bit short of a year ago, now about 50% of the people that come through the gate, actually buy up to that Genie product which I think you can see the result of in our yields. Okay. In terms of the strategy on sports, we're continually enamored by the power sports in terms of viewership and what it adds to our overall portfolio particularly in an advertising type world. As you know, we get strong cash flows on linear and it helps to pay some of the bills in the companies we make some of our significant investments in content, and we also like the proposition of growth and expansion on our DTC.. In terms of the rights, if you look at the college rights, we've got the SEC, we've got the ACC, we've got the Pac-12. We've got the Big 12. We've got the play off. We've got the most comprehensive programming. So if we don't get rights in every single conference, we don't believe that's in any way limiting for us. But what we're all preparing for is the future of what ESPN would look like in a direct-to-consumer -- in a true direct-to-consumer fashion. And I think the way that we're looking at this is that we want to proactively prepare for that future without prematurely disrupting the cash flow that we get from the linear networks right now. And as you know we've negotiated flexibility into our rights agreements across the board for any new rights that we have acquired over the last several years, but we're still bullish on sports. We believe there's tremendous degrees of freedom in terms of what ESPN DTC ultimately looks like. I think we're very proud of what we've done to-date on ESPN+, but that no way limits how we envision what true ESPN DTC proposition would look like going into the future. I should say that the technology for Disney+ is a completely different platform than the Hulu platform. So, while we certainly have tremendous learnings over the years, in terms of how to do addressable advertising and we've done that at the advantage of our shareholders' result. I will have to say that, we are not encumbered by that or in any way limited by what we've done in the past. Therefore, we could have an ad proposition as good as the one that we've had on Hulu, but it could actually be better because of that different technology platform. So, it has the ability to evolve over time much more on the new platform than it does in the old platform."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alexia Quadrani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, Disney's employees and cast members continued to execute against our strategic priorities of storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus, and I could not be more proud of what they've achieved. Our strong results this quarter, including fantastic performance at our domestic parks and continued growth at our streaming services, along with the creative achievements of our content teams once again proved that we are in a league of our own. We have entertainment's most iconic brands and the world's favorite franchises, a high-quality creative pipeline that will continue to drive engagement and consumption and an unrivaled synergy machine with touch points that reach audiences across distribution channels, geographies and demographics, all of which come together to create a deep emotional connection with audiences across generations. I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter that illustrate these strengths, and then Christine will go through the details of our results. As I said, our domestic parks were a standout. They continue to fire on all cylinders, powered by strong demand, coupled with customized and personalized guest experience enhancements that grew per capita spending by more than 40% versus 2019. Response to next-generation storytelling like Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser has been phenomenal. In fact, guest ratings for this immersive experience, which opened March 1, are incredibly high and in line with our best-in-class offerings. Demand is strong, and we expect 100% utilization through the end of Q3. Looking ahead, we could not be more excited to officially welcome riders on Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at Epcot on May 27. One of the longest indoor rollercoasters in the world, the attraction puts guests in the middle of an exciting adventure as they're called on to help the Guardians out of a jam. With our first-ever reverse launch and rotating cars that turn riders 360 degrees, guests won't miss a second of the story during our most immersive coaster experience yet. At Disneyland Paris, we are thrilled to take the next step in our ambitious expansion plan, the opening of Avengers Campus this summer as part of the resort's 30th anniversary celebration. As Europe recovers from the pandemic, we've seen strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris and look forward to its continued recovery. Another standout this quarter were our streaming services. We ended Q2 with more than 205 million total subscriptions after adding 9.2 million in the quarter. That includes 7.9 million Disney+ subscribers, keeping us on track to reach 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by fiscal '24. The growth of the platform since its launch reinforces its unique nature. Quite simply, we believe Disney+ is one of a kind, a service based on exceptional branded content with wide appeal across all 4 quadrants. It's certainly popular with families, but as a reminder, almost half of Disney+ subscribers are adults without kids. In recognition of Disney+'s unique ability to attract viewers from a range of demographic groups, we are selectively enhancing Disney+ with general entertainment titles designed to drive sign-ups amongst specific audiences and deepen engagement amongst those cohorts. A benefit of our incredible creative engines and decades of general entertainment excellence is that we can reach these demographics not only through the creation of original titles but also by shifting resources from across our content ecosystem, especially as consumer behavior continues to evolve. Our strategy is not just to fill our distribution pipelines but to be thoughtful with each asset to best position it amongst our various distribution options. For instance, Dancing with the Stars is a beloved show that has entertained viewers for more than 30 seasons on ABC and is a wonderful example of content that brings the whole family together. We recently announced Disney+ will be the series\u2019 new home starting this fall. Beyond targeting specific demos, we are equally enthusiastic about our growth potential in international markets. We currently have over 500 local original titles in various stages of development and production. 180 of those titles are slated to premiere this fiscal year, increasing to over 300 international originals per year in steady state. We believe these premium local originals, along with branded content with broad international appeal, will attract new subscribers and drive engagement. One example in production is Nautilus from our EMEA team. Based on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Nautilus is the origin story of the iconic submarine from the perspective of its mysterious commander, Captain Nemo. This is just one example of how our global network of creative hubs can develop and produce original content with worldwide appeal. And by the end of Q3 we plan to roll out Disney+ to 53 new markets across Europe, Africa and West Asia, starting with South Africa next week. Before leaving Disney+, I want to mention our recently announced plans to introduce an ad-supported subscription offering in the U.S. by the end of the calendar year and internationally in 2023. Expanding Disney+ access through multiple price points is a win for consumers and advertisers. Of course, all of our success is rooted in great content. Our general entertainment team continued its string of phenomenal series with Hulu's Pam & Tommy and The Dropout. And while not in the quarter we could not be happier with the performance of the Kardashians. More great general entertainment content is ahead, like the second season of Only Murders in the Building on Hulu and the record-breaking 19th season of ABC's Grey's Anatomy. This quarter, our studios earned 6 Academy awards, including best Animated Feature for Walt Disney Animation Studios, Encanto; and Best Documentary Feature for Onyx Collective and Searchlight Pictures Summer of Soul. Pixar Animation Studios Turning Red premiered on March 11 on Disney+ and became the fastest title to reach 200 million hours viewed on the platform. The Disney+ original series Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett drew positive reaction from audiences, and Marvel's Moon Knight continue the studio's impressive track record. Looking ahead, our studios will continue to deliver high-quality content at scale with an exciting array of series and films coming to all of our distribution channels. In fact, our slate for the remainder of this year is incredibly strong with titles like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ms. Marvel, Lightyear, Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and the long anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water. Finally, I must mention the phenomenal success of Marvel's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which opened to roughly $450 million worldwide this past weekend. Domestically, it was the second-highest opening of the pandemic era and the 11th highest opening of all time. Our strategy of distribution flexibility has worked well for us, and these fantastic results are another sign of our ability to succeed no matter the platform. That success extends to sports. ESPN viewership was notably strong for the quarter across both live events and studio programming with ratings up double digits, and we remain encouraged by how fans are engaging with sports content coming out of the pandemic. Opening weekend of the NBA Playoffs was the most viewed in the past decade, and the ratings have been fantastic with over 4.3 million average viewers through 20 games on ABC and ESPN. Our ground-breaking NHL deal is unique in its exposure across ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, culminating with the Stanley Cup Playoffs, which began on May 2. In fact, the combination of the NHL and NBA Playoffs going on simultaneously kicks off an exciting stretch of championship programming that also includes Wimbledon, the NCAA Women's and Men's College World Series, UFC Boxing and more. Coming off the success of Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli, we recently debuted our new season-long MLB alternative broadcast, KayRod Cast with Michael Kay and Alex Rodriguez. And we began the inaugural season of PGA TOUR Live on ESPN+, featuring over 4,000 hours of live golf coverage from 35 tournaments. Before I hand it over to Christine, I want to say a few words about our unique synergy machine or franchise flywheel, if you prefer. What sets Disney apart is our ability to reach people with our uniquely engaging content across an array of touch points to make our portfolio of businesses and brands a bigger part of their lives. This enables us to not only create new franchises like Encanto, but to also build on existing IP across our lines of business. One example of this is our Toy Story franchise, which was created almost 3 decades ago with the release of the first film in 1995 and which is now brought to life across distribution platforms, geographies, businesses and time. In our parks, we've built a portfolio of 4 immersive Toy Story lands with more than 20 attractions and live character interactions available around the world as well as 2 themed hotels. The franchise is the cornerstone of Disney+ with all 4 feature-length films as well as the original short series, Forky Asks a Question, exclusively available on the service. And nearly 30 years after the film debuted, Toy Story is still a key consumer products franchise, generating over $1 billion in annual retail sales. And in just a few weeks, Pixar's Lightyear will tell the origin story of everyone's favorite Space Ranger when it hits theaters on June 17. Of course, Toy Story is just one of our many franchises, but it illustrates our unparalleled ability to bring stories to life in more ways for more people in more places. In fact, our franchise library and capabilities will continue to set us apart even further as we bring our IP to life through next-generation storytelling that is more integrated and connected across consumer touch points. As we look to our second century, that's our mission: to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger, more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter were $1.08, an increase of $0.29 versus the prior year quarter. We continue to be pleased with our financial results with total segment operating income increasing by 50% versus the prior year quarter and by over 80% year-to-date. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment continued to show strong signs of growth and recovery as operating income increased by nearly $2.2 billion year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion. Growth was primarily driven by our domestic parks, which were open for the entire quarter. In the prior year, Walt Disney World was open, but Disneyland was closed for the entire quarter. We continue to be pleased with the overall demand and attendance trends at our domestic parks. In fact, there were many days in the quarter where we saw demand exceed 2019 levels. However, we are continuing to control attendance through our reservation system with an eye on delivering a quality guest experience. As Bob mentioned earlier, per capita guest spending at our domestic parks increased by over 40% versus Q2 of fiscal 2019 and by 20% versus Q2 of fiscal 2021 with increases across the board on admissions, food and beverage and merchandise. Looking ahead to the third quarter. Our forward-looking demand pipeline at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland remains robust. And while attendance from international visitation is still in the early days of recovery, we are beginning to see some improvements. We are also thrilled that as of the end of March, all of our domestic resorts are now open, a major milestone as we continue to move through the impacts of the pandemic. At our international parks, operating results improved versus the prior year due to growth at Disneyland Paris, which was open in Q2 and closed during the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by lower results at Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disney, both of which were impacted by COVID-related closures in the quarter. Consumer Products operating income increased in the quarter, reflecting higher sales of merchandise based on several of our iconic franchises, including Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man, Star Wars and Disney Princess. Moving on to the Media & Entertainment Distribution segment. Second quarter operating income decreased by approximately $900 million versus the prior year as revenue growth of about $1.2 billion, primarily driven by direct-to-consumer was more than offset by higher expenses, including programming and production expenses at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer, which came roughly in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. At our Linear Networks business, operating income in the quarter was $2.8 billion or roughly flat versus the prior year as modest growth at our domestic channels was offset by a decline at our international channels. Domestically, higher operating income at Broadcasting was partially offset by lower results at Cable. Broadcasting results benefited year-over-year from affiliate revenue growth in addition to higher advertising revenue due to the timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in Q2 this year versus Q3 last year. These impacts were partially offset by higher programming and production costs also driven by the timing of the Academy Awards. At Cable, lower operating income versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in programming and production costs. The largest component of the increased cost was driven by 4 additional NFL games versus the prior year, consisting of 3 regular season games as well as the return of the Pro Bowl. These impacts were partially offset by growth in cable advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at ESPN increased by over 30% in the quarter, and third quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up significantly benefiting from a return to a pre-COVID NBA schedule that is driving increased viewership and pricing. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 5% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by 7 points of growth from higher rates, partially offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating income at our international channels decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower affiliate revenue and an increase in programming and production costs, partially offset by advertising revenue growth. At Direct-to-Consumer, operating losses widened to almost $900 million due to higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ and lower operating income at Hulu. The higher losses at our DTC services were largely driven by higher programming and production expenses in line with what we noted in our guidance last quarter. At Disney+, programming and production costs grew along with marketing and technology costs to support our growth around the world, partially offset by higher subscription revenue. We ended the quarter with nearly 138 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting close to 8 million net additions from Q1. A little over half of those net adds were from Disney+ Hotstar, which benefited from the start of the new IPL season towards the end of the second quarter. Internationally, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added over 2 million paid subscribers versus the first quarter with Latin America being the strongest contributor, driven by growth of the Combo+ offering. Domestically, net adds of approximately 1.5 million reflect in part the success of tentpole content releases, including Turning Red and Moon Knight as well as the strength of our bundled and multiproduct offerings. ESPN+ ended Q2 with 22.3 million paid subscribers, a net increase of about 1 million versus Q1. Operating results decreased compared to the prior year due to higher sports programming costs and lower pay-per-view income, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, which ended the second quarter with 45.6 million paid subscribers, higher subscription and advertising revenues versus the prior year were more than offset by higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs. Moving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased by approximately $300 million versus the prior year, driven by lower TV and SVOD results, which we discussed in our guidance last quarter, in addition to a decrease in home entertainment results. As a reminder, these impacts are deliberately aligned with our strategic decision to utilize our content on our own direct-to-consumer services. Before I touch on a few things that we'd like you to keep in mind for the back half of the fiscal year, I'll quickly note 2 other relevant items for the second quarter. We recognized a revenue reversal of $1 billion related to the early termination of content licensing agreements with a customer in order to make that content available on our own direct-to-consumer services. Because substantially all of the consideration we received was recognized as revenue at the time that content was originally made available in previous years, we've recorded amounts to terminate the agreement net of remaining amounts of deferred revenue as a revenue reversal. Finally, a note on the impact of some tax-related items on our Q2 EPS. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items of $1.08 includes an adverse impact of approximately $0.11 due to the impact of higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of a recent change in U.S. tax regulations. It's worth mentioning that while our annual effective tax rate has generally been correlated with the U.S. statutory rate, there are many complex puts and takes in any given period, which can lead to these variances quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect the full year tax rate could remain somewhat elevated above the U.S. statutory rate. Now as it relates to the third quarter and the second half of fiscal 2022. At DPEP, closures at our Asia theme parks could adversely impact operating income in the third quarter by up to approximately $350 million versus the prior year. As a reminder, Hong Kong Disneyland was closed for the first 3 weeks of the quarter. Shanghai Disney has been closed quarter-to-date, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date. As we continue to strategically prioritize leveraging our content for our own services, we expect content sales, licensing and other operating results to decrease in the third quarter by approximately $150 million to $200 million versus the prior year. The expected decrease is primarily driven by declines in content licensing along with a continued decline in home entertainment results. Direct-to-Consumer programming and production costs in Q3 are expected to increase by more than $900 million year-over-year, reflecting higher original content expense at Disney+ and Hulu increased sports rights costs and higher programming fees at Hulu Live. At Disney+, while we still expect higher net adds in the second half of the year versus the first half, it's worth mentioning that we did have a stronger-than-expected first half of the year. Additionally, note that some of the Eastern European markets were launching in towards the end of Q3, including Poland, are in regions being impacted by geopolitical factors. As it relates to content spend, we previously stated that we expect fiscal year 2022 cash content spend to total as much as $33 billion. We've adjusted that amount to as much as $32 billion to reflect a slightly slower cadence of spending than anticipated during the first half of the year. Note that we are still expecting a strong content slate in the back half of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we are confident in our long-term subscriber guidance of 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subs by fiscal 2024. We also still expect that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you, Christine. We are happy to be back here in person for this call. But to make it easier, I will help direct the questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many analysts as possible today.  And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Your first question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman : Bob touched on pricing to some degree during his comments. So I thought we could come back to that. One of the questions we've been getting is, how do you think about the right cadence for revisiting pricing on Disney+ really when you can take price higher? It just seems like there's a lot of factors that would go into that, including the fact you'll be launching a new ad-supported tier. You're putting a lot more content onto the service. You've seen some increased competition. And obviously, there's some inflationary pressures, and I'm just not quite sure if you put all that to a pot what that yields in terms of how you're thinking about pricing.\nBob Chapek : All right. Thank you. As you know, we launch with an extremely attractive opening price point on Disney+, and we've been very comfortable with the price-value relationship that we've offered. And as you know, as we increase our content investment, we believe that that's going to give us the ability to adjust our price by -- and still, at the same time, maintain that strong value proposition. You mentioned the Disney+ ad tier I think this is going to give us the ability to reach an even more broad audience as we expand Disney+ across multiple price points. And using some of our other services, we can see the additive nature of an ad-driven service that enables us to keep the price lower. Of course, that's made up for by the additional revenue that we would get per user on the advertising spending. So we believe that we can sort of move up and cascade up our net price over time given the tremendous value that we started with and the increased price-value relationship of all the new content, but we're pretty bullish about that. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: A question, and if I can, Alexia, just a clarification from the prepared remarks. On parks, as you know, you'll start to lap some really strong significant double-digit per capita growth as you move through the rest of the summer and into the fall. And I'm just wondering, particularly given how focused everybody is on the economy and inflation, the consumer, if you're seeing any signs that would suggest that you're going to see substantial deceleration or even maybe not grow your per capita growth at the domestic parks. Just be curious on how you're thinking about the full year and as you lap these comparisons. And then I just wanted to come back, Christine, on the second half net adds. Are you still expecting a stronger second half at Disney+ than the first half and you're just calling out that maybe the relative comparison won't be as pronounced? I just wanted to make sure I understood what you -- we understood what you were saying.\nAlexia Quadrani : Bob, why don't you take the first half and then Christine can follow up.\nBob Chapek : Okay. So we continue to see really strong demand, and we're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing, particularly as we're going to get some improvements to international visitation. But we're controlling our attendance, as Christine mentioned in her comments, using our reservation system to optimize the guest experience. But that domestic yield strategy, and we're also seeing it in Paris, is really exceeding our expectations. If you remember, last quarter, we mentioned that we had some high hopes for it, but we were seeing well above what we had anticipated. While I'm happy to say that in Q2 or even, as you say, we're lapping those numbers again even higher. So we're very, very encouraged by the continuation of the trends that we're seeing in terms of the number of people. For example, that sign-up for Genie+, plus the willingness to come to our parks with our balanced reservation system, which really helps us sort of manage our price per day, if you will. So that domestic yield strategy has really structurally allowed us to increase that per capita spending meaningfully without having to rely solely on raising ticket prices, and we don't see any end in sight for that.\nChristine McCarthy : Great. Ben, your question on net adds for the second half of the year, we still do expect an increase over the first half. However, the first half came in better than expected, so that delta that we had initially anticipated may not be as large. But we still do expect an increase in the second half to exceed the first half.\nOperator: Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Nathanson : I have 2. First would be, Bob, it seems that the equity markets are now focused on kind of the cost to achieve subscriber growth and maybe not just focused on the sub numbers as much as the cost to achieve. So I wonder with you, given the rising content costs you're seeing in things like sports and competition around the globe, how do you measure maybe the need to drive shareholder returns versus attaining those sub targets that were laid out in 2020? And how do you -- and how and when will you determine what the ROIC would be on maybe the next 100 million subs versus the first 100 million subs? And then, Christine, can you talk a bit about any type of incremental margins at the parks? Very strong so far, halfway through the year. Any type of inflation on the parks that could limit maybe the margin growth we've seen at this point?\nBob Chapek : So as you know, we're very carefully watching our content growth -- content cost growth. And we reaffirmed, as you heard earlier, our targets, our guidance on both subs and on profitability. So we think they move together. It's obviously a balancing act, but we believe that great content is going to drive our subs, and those subs then in scale will drive our profitability. So we don't see them as necessarily counter. We see them as sort of consistent with the overall approach that we've laid out. We're extremely happy with the content that we've got, both across the general entertainment option, which frankly is -- you heard that 50% of our subs are families without kids. And so at the same time, that relative content expenditure is a little cheaper than our typical franchise expenditure on a per-program basis. So even though we're adding a lot of content both in local, international markets and as well in the general entertainment area, it doesn't come at the per-title level, if you will, that we've been seeing sort of to date on our general franchise films. That said, we're balancing all 3. And we're very confident that going forward, we're going to hit both of those sub guidance and profitability guidance by bringing in the cost at a reasonable level relative to their ability to attract and retain our subs.\nChristine McCarthy : Hi, Michael. On the parks margins, as Bob said, we feel really good about the consumer demand and what we're seeing in the forward-looking bookings and everything else in the attendance levels. So we feel good about that portion of margins. The one that is more challenging is what we face with inflation. But we do pay close attention to all the recent inflationary pressures, and it covers everything from merchandise to food and beverage. I'll give you an example of something -- for those, we are actually always looking at mitigating impacts of rising costs. But I'll give you a good example of one that we are executing on, and that is the increased cost in fuel. We have a very robust fuel hedging program at Walt Disney World, and that reduces risk and minimizes volatility, reduces volatility in the cost of fuel. And so that -- while we suspended that program while the parks were shut, we have reopened that program and we are doing what we can to minimize the impact on that particular cost. We do have the labor impacts. Rising wages is something everybody is dealing with and a tighter labor market. On the supply chain, our business isn't immune to the global supply chain challenges. And to the extent we experience any product availability impacts given strong demand that we're seeing, we're working with our suppliers to diversify some of our suppliers, and we're also working with shippers to expedite the time to receive those through shipping. But right now, it's very difficult to accurately forecast the potential financial impact due to the fluidity of the situation. But you can trust that we are fully aware of it, and we're working hard to mitigate any pressure on the margins.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question?\nOperator: From Jessica Rief Ehrlich with Bank of America.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich : I have one big question, one multipart. Can you -- with the upfronts coming next week, can you give us some -- any color on how you're thinking about what this year's effort will be like given changes in measurement, multiple platforms that you're selling across and, of course, the economy? And staying with the theme on -- given your upcoming rollout of the AVOD platform for Disney+, you already have Hulu ad inventory, and now you're adding Disney+. Do you think this will grow the pie overall for Disney advertising dollars? Or will this ultimately just drive share shift from traditional broadcast linear? Is it incremental or not? How are you thinking about that? And how much do you think that having an ad-supported service will increase overall TAM for subscribers?\nBob Chapek : Okay. Let's see. I'm going to take the first part first. We're expecting a very positive reaction from advertisers overall. And as you suggest, this is a combination of our excitement around the Disney+ ad tier. They have been asking for this for years. And we also expect Hulu, as you know, which has been very strong for us at the same time, to be a key contributor of our performance at the upfront this year. The other thing is that sports are going to continue to be in high demand. And so with the advertisers, we focused on the right deals that we've made over the past few years as well as our robust slate of original content shows and our studio shows and original content games. In terms of sort of the growing-the-pie idea, we believe that the value proposition of advertising with Disney+ is only enhanced with our addition of an ad-supported tier on Disney+. So we believe it's good for the consumer because it's going to give us another entry price point, but it's also going to be great for the advertisers. Our advertisers increasingly are looking for multiple platforms to reach a broader reach. And we think that as a company, we're going to provide that given our portfolio of streaming and our linear networks. So I think we're creating more avenues, both for consumer choice and for comprehensive advertising solutions, for our advertising customers at the same time.\nOperator: From Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo.\nSteven Cahall: Just 2. Maybe first, Bob, what's holding you back from making ESPN a fully a la carte sports network? Disney historically has always been more aggressive in the pivot to streaming than some of the peers. We've already seen some of the peers put a lot of their key sports like the NFL on to streaming. You talked a lot about how much the bundle is working with Disney+ and Hulu. So just really wondering how you're thinking about all the content you've got on ESPN+ and what it would take to make that fully a la carte and drive the DTC strategy even harder. And then Christina, I have asked this before, so I'm just going to try again. Of the $32 billion in content spend, any help in sizing maybe how much of that is either general entertainment or local content?\nBob Chapek : Okay. So as you know, on all of our Linear Networks, they're huge cash generators for us. So to some extent, we're doing a really good job of chopping down some of the debt that we've had to accumulate due to either acquisition or through the COVID challenge. And so the hesitancy to move too fast away from those is really a cash flow situation that I think puts our company in a healthier overall situation. At the same time, we're very conscious of our ability to go more aggressively into the DTC area of ESPN. And so what we're doing is sort of putting one foot on the dock, if you will, and one foot on the boat right now. But we know that at some point when it's going to be good for our shareholders, we'll be able to fully go into an ESPN DTC offering the way that you described. And we fully believe that there is a business model there for us that's going to enable us to regain growth on ESPN+ in a full DTC expression. But at that point, obviously, that will have ramifications on immediate cash flow that we get from our legacy Linear Networks.\nChristine McCarthy : Okay. Steve, to answer your question on that $32 billion of content spend and where it's going, remember back when we talked about that initially, we talked about it being about 1/3 in sports. That still remains. And when you think about the balance of that $32 billion, a meaningful amount of it will be enterprise-wide content budget that will be dedicated into investments into the general entertainment content that we can leverage across all of our various distribution platforms. When we say that, we mean linear, theatrical as well as direct-to-consumer. And as I mentioned earlier, our world-class creative teams are focused on creating content that will drive subscriber growth in targeted segments and deeper engagement across the platform. This includes leveraging our existing intellectual property. Also, we're intent on creating new franchises. You saw that in Encanto and investing in general entertainment, local language content and sports rights. I just want to -- even though you didn't ask about local language content. I do want to give you some perspective because we haven't provided this previously. But as Bob mentioned, we have about 500 shows in the pipeline for local content outside of the U.S. or English speaking. When you look at that 500, I'll give you some broad breakdowns. In the Asia Pacific region, including Southeast Asia, of that 500, 140 is in that region; in EMEA, it's 150; in India, it's 100; and in Latin America, it's 200. So we haven't given that before, but I think that also kind of breaks it up in the various regions that we are in outside of the U.S.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Next question is from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.\nKannan Venkateshwar : A couple, if I could. So Bob, first, I guess, when we think about the streaming goal, if we are really looking at 240 million subs at the midpoint, with the new ad-supported streaming service, what proportion of the base do you expect will be on that tier versus normal premium tier, especially given the fact that now you may have to do more than 50 million subs a year to get to that goal given the trend lines for this year? So that would be the first one. And secondly, I don't think Disney has been able to release a movie in China since 2019. If you could just help us understand what the roadblocks there are and when we could see some change in that process?\nBob Chapek : Okay. I'm going to start with China. And the situation there has been very fluid, and as you probably guess, very complicated both from a business standpoint and from a political standpoint. But as you know, we've got a long record of success and a strong fan base for our brands and franchises in this market. And our most recent releases were Death on the Nile and Encanto. And we'll continue to submit our films for release. And it's worth noting, I think, though, that at the time that we're having some difficulty in getting our films in China that Doctor Strange did extraordinary. We've just crossed $500 million in less than a week without this market. So we're pretty confident that even without China, if it were to be that we continue to have difficulties in getting titles in there, that it doesn't really preclude our success given the relatively lower take rate that we get on the box office in China than we do across the rest of the world. Christine, do you want to talk about streaming?\nChristine McCarthy : Sure. On streaming, right now, we have not disclosed a mix or expected mix of an ad-supported tier. So we don't have any additional details on that product, and that includes pricing as well. But when we expand Disney+ across multiple price points with this new Disney+ ad tier, we are able to reach an even broader audience, and we'll create more avenues for consumer choice. And this is a consistent theme that you've heard from us, having the consumer be our North Star. We'll continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service, our brand and our core principle of providing consumers with the maximum flexibility and choice. So we expect the advertising revenue we earn will contribute positively to our ARPU as we look to achieve our long-term profitability goals.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator next question?\nOperator: Question is from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick : A couple of follow-ups, if I can. On parks, can you talk about where the parks are -- the U.S. parks are in terms of staffing at parks as well as the potential for upside or not in those domestic attendance numbers for customers? And then, Bob, if I can go back to your comment on ESPN going all online someday, I think most of us expect us to happen eventually. Clearly, that will be a huge change in the P&L at both DTC and linear. When that happens, does the overall profitability of the company take a hit for a year or 2? And how does the long-term sports on ESPN+ model work? And what's the structure of that versus what we've seen in the past of a purely linear model?\nAlexia Quadrani : Christine, do you want to start with the first question? And then Bob second.\nChristine McCarthy : Sure. On our parks business, we're obviously extremely pleased with our domestic parks operations and how they have come back robustly. But on domestic attendance, we are -- we could, but we're choosing to limit attendance using our reservation system. And once again, that goes back to us trying to balance demand and attendance throughout the year, not have days when consumers in the parks aren't enjoying the experience. So attendance is something that we're controlling, but we're doing it to have a better consumer experience. And some of the things that we've brought back, we will continue to with additional capacity. But some capacity that we just brought back in April were things like the character meet-and-greets at our domestic parks. And we also brought back in April our Nighttime Spectaculars at the Disneyland Resort. And we'll also be opening a new attraction at Walt Disney World Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at the end of this month on Memorial Day weekend, and that is all new capacity, and we're really looking forward to having our guests experience that.\nBob Chapek : Okay. And on the ESPN question, we're not ready to share the specifics of our model in terms of how long it would take for us to reach profitability on that or the impact that it would have on our linear business. But I would emphasize that we're only going to do it if it's accretive to our shareholder value when it comes time to actually pull the trigger. But I can tell you that it will be the ultimate fan offering that will appeal to super fans that really love sports. And I think there's nobody but ESPN that, frankly, could actually pull that off. But we don't have a lot of specifics when it comes to structure. But we do believe that because sports is so powerful, in fact, in the last quarter, 46 of the top 50 most viewed programs on linear TV were sports. And obviously, ESPN dominates that. And I do believe that sports is the third leg of our domestic offerings in terms of our DTC offerings. And right now, that expression is through the bundle. And I think that could become very powerful for us going forward in the future.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator next question please?\nOperator: From Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDouglas Mitchelson : So I guess 2 questions, if I could. Bob, you've continued to suggest a lot of confidence in Disney+ guidance. Can you talk about trends for churn and engagement for Disney+? And I'm not sure if you're willing to share how much of Disney+ viewing is new content versus library, just thinking as more and more new content starts to show up and ramp. And then separately, and maybe this is for Christine, Alexia, you'll let me know. But I'm just curious what you think the international fee park margin potential as it peaked at 16% in fiscal '19. I think we're getting a pretty good idea that the domestic theme parks is going to be very, very profitable. But international is still a bit of a mystery. I know you've got some parks closed and there's some disruption, but you also have a good idea of what you're seeing in the U.S., how you could apply that overseas and what you've done with the cost structure during the pandemic. And also, if you look back at fiscal '19, sorry for making the question a little bit longer, but Hong Kong was shut down for part of the year; china was, what, in year 3. So I'm just curious if those international margins, do we think about them getting closer and closer to U.S. margins over time?\nAlexia Quadrani : Bob, why don't you take the first half? And then Christine can follow up on parks.\nBob Chapek : Okay. In terms of our confidence in Disney+ guidance, as you probably know, we have a tremendous amount of data that we get on our DCC platforms, things like the first view, what's the first view that somebody watches when they first come on to our platform, which is a pretty good proxy for maybe why they signed up. There's also the amount of time spent, the engagement scores and then, of course, the churn information that you sort of look at. And we've said this before in past earnings calls, but we're extraordinarily pleased with the low churn that we see, particularly given the bundle. The bundle is really efficient in terms of churn. And that gives us a lot of bullishness when it comes to the idea of bigger offerings from Disney. So as we sort of take each of these elements, when we get a new piece of content, we'll look at first view, we'll look at engagement, we'll look at the amount of time they spend on it. And we can model. We can do a lot of modeling. And that modeling suggests that in addition to things like local market content, new content coming online, both in terms of general entertainment and from franchises as well as new markets being added, that, that Disney+ guidance is going to be very achievable for us both in terms of the sub adds and in terms of the operating performance.\nChristine McCarthy : Okay. On international theme parks, Doug. On Asia, I think it's really too early for us to tell. And as you heard in my comments, we said that we could see a negative impact of Hong Kong and Shanghai of $350 million in the next quarter, so just keep that in mind. But it is a bit of a tale of 2 cities. I can give you some very positive trends we're seeing out of Disneyland Paris. So just like domestically, we're seeing very strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris. And we're looking forward to its continued recovery, particularly with the recent launch of their 30th anniversary celebration. Avengers Campus, that's the first new themed area of our multiyear expansion that we've talked about previously for DLP, that will open this summer. And what has already opened is the -- one of our large hotels over there, the New York Hotel, has been re-themed in a Marvel theme and Avengers theme. So that's very exciting. And our guests love staying there. So I think it's -- what we're seeing in Paris gives me hope. Hope is not a strategy, but it gives me hope that our other parks in Asia will see that same rebound when their COVID-related headwinds abate.\nDouglas Mitchelson : If I could just follow up, maybe the simple way to put it is, you've talked about the potential for higher park margins than previous peak. Would that apply to both domestic parks, and separately, international parks longer term?\nChristine McCarthy : Well, Doug, we've said it for domestic. I -- we're not going to update that for international. There's just too much uncertainty with the region in Asia that has 2 of our parks right now.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator we have time for one more question.\nOperator: From Michael Morris with Guggenheim.\nMichael Morris : I have a couple on this advertising tier we're talking about for Disney+. My first is, can you share anything else on what remains to be done prior to the rollout, the implementation of that advertising tier? Are there assets you need to acquire? Or what are you building or anything like that given the pieces that you do already have in place through your ownership of Hulu, et cetera? So I'm curious about the advertising infrastructure. And then the second, you touched on this a little bit, Christine, but I'm curious if you can share any more relative sizing of the ARPU potential of the ad-supported service. Given that Disney+ is still half the price of Netflix domestically, I'm curious if ad-supported ARPU could actually be higher than where you are right now and if this does present a catalyst for you to raise price on the ad-free service?\nAlexia Quadrani : Bob, why don't you start and then Christine can finish.\nBob Chapek : Okay. We're in really good shape in terms of being able to meet our timing with our Disney+ ad tier. And that's largely because we're already doing it. The combination of our ESPN+, streaming tech stack and our experience in Hulu and the software, we think that our current advertising capabilities really substantially prepare us to already bring this tier into operations. So there's nothing that we need to go acquire or, frankly, even in any significant way developing anything new. And that's due to the ongoing investments in technology that we've made over time to increasingly automate much of this process. And we've been looking forward to this for a while. So this is something that's well-greased, if you will. And our teams are hard at work at making that become a reality.\nChristine McCarthy : So on the incremental information you would like on our ad-supported tier, at this time, we haven't announced a price point for it. So we're not going to do that today. But we will continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service in terms of pricing. And I will say that you can look to our experience with Hulu and their ad-supported tier. We believe that this will contribute to ARPU. And we look at it as certainly something additive that will work towards achieving our long-term profitability goals.\nAlexia Quadrani : Okay.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter were $1.08, an increase of $0.29 versus the prior year quarter. We continue to be pleased with our financial results with total segment operating income increasing by 50% versus the prior year quarter and by over 80% year-to-date. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment continued to show strong signs of growth and recovery as operating income increased by nearly $2.2 billion year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion. Growth was primarily driven by our domestic parks, which were open for the entire quarter. In the prior year, Walt Disney World was open, but Disneyland was closed for the entire quarter. We continue to be pleased with the overall demand and attendance trends at our domestic parks. In fact, there were many days in the quarter where we saw demand exceed 2019 levels. However, we are continuing to control attendance through our reservation system with an eye on delivering a quality guest experience. As Bob mentioned earlier, per capita guest spending at our domestic parks increased by over 40% versus Q2 of fiscal 2019 and by 20% versus Q2 of fiscal 2021 with increases across the board on admissions, food and beverage and merchandise. Looking ahead to the third quarter. Our forward-looking demand pipeline at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland remains robust. And while attendance from international visitation is still in the early days of recovery, we are beginning to see some improvements. We are also thrilled that as of the end of March, all of our domestic resorts are now open, a major milestone as we continue to move through the impacts of the pandemic. At our international parks, operating results improved versus the prior year due to growth at Disneyland Paris, which was open in Q2 and closed during the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by lower results at Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disney, both of which were impacted by COVID-related closures in the quarter. Consumer Products operating income increased in the quarter, reflecting higher sales of merchandise based on several of our iconic franchises, including Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man, Star Wars and Disney Princess. Moving on to the Media & Entertainment Distribution segment. Second quarter operating income decreased by approximately $900 million versus the prior year as revenue growth of about $1.2 billion, primarily driven by direct-to-consumer was more than offset by higher expenses, including programming and production expenses at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer, which came roughly in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. At our Linear Networks business, operating income in the quarter was $2.8 billion or roughly flat versus the prior year as modest growth at our domestic channels was offset by a decline at our international channels. Domestically, higher operating income at Broadcasting was partially offset by lower results at Cable. Broadcasting results benefited year-over-year from affiliate revenue growth in addition to higher advertising revenue due to the timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in Q2 this year versus Q3 last year. These impacts were partially offset by higher programming and production costs also driven by the timing of the Academy Awards. At Cable, lower operating income versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in programming and production costs. The largest component of the increased cost was driven by 4 additional NFL games versus the prior year, consisting of 3 regular season games as well as the return of the Pro Bowl. These impacts were partially offset by growth in cable advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at ESPN increased by over 30% in the quarter, and third quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up significantly benefiting from a return to a pre-COVID NBA schedule that is driving increased viewership and pricing. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 5% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by 7 points of growth from higher rates, partially offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating income at our international channels decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower affiliate revenue and an increase in programming and production costs, partially offset by advertising revenue growth. At Direct-to-Consumer, operating losses widened to almost $900 million due to higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ and lower operating income at Hulu. The higher losses at our DTC services were largely driven by higher programming and production expenses in line with what we noted in our guidance last quarter. At Disney+, programming and production costs grew along with marketing and technology costs to support our growth around the world, partially offset by higher subscription revenue. We ended the quarter with nearly 138 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting close to 8 million net additions from Q1. A little over half of those net adds were from Disney+ Hotstar, which benefited from the start of the new IPL season towards the end of the second quarter. Internationally, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added over 2 million paid subscribers versus the first quarter with Latin America being the strongest contributor, driven by growth of the Combo+ offering. Domestically, net adds of approximately 1.5 million reflect in part the success of tentpole content releases, including Turning Red and Moon Knight as well as the strength of our bundled and multiproduct offerings. ESPN+ ended Q2 with 22.3 million paid subscribers, a net increase of about 1 million versus Q1. Operating results decreased compared to the prior year due to higher sports programming costs and lower pay-per-view income, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, which ended the second quarter with 45.6 million paid subscribers, higher subscription and advertising revenues versus the prior year were more than offset by higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs. Moving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased by approximately $300 million versus the prior year, driven by lower TV and SVOD results, which we discussed in our guidance last quarter, in addition to a decrease in home entertainment results. As a reminder, these impacts are deliberately aligned with our strategic decision to utilize our content on our own direct-to-consumer services. Before I touch on a few things that we'd like you to keep in mind for the back half of the fiscal year, I'll quickly note 2 other relevant items for the second quarter. We recognized a revenue reversal of $1 billion related to the early termination of content licensing agreements with a customer in order to make that content available on our own direct-to-consumer services. Because substantially all of the consideration we received was recognized as revenue at the time that content was originally made available in previous years, we've recorded amounts to terminate the agreement net of remaining amounts of deferred revenue as a revenue reversal. Finally, a note on the impact of some tax-related items on our Q2 EPS. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items of $1.08 includes an adverse impact of approximately $0.11 due to the impact of higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of a recent change in U.S. tax regulations. It's worth mentioning that while our annual effective tax rate has generally been correlated with the U.S. statutory rate, there are many complex puts and takes in any given period, which can lead to these variances quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect the full year tax rate could remain somewhat elevated above the U.S. statutory rate. Now as it relates to the third quarter and the second half of fiscal 2022. At DPEP, closures at our Asia theme parks could adversely impact operating income in the third quarter by up to approximately $350 million versus the prior year. As a reminder, Hong Kong Disneyland was closed for the first 3 weeks of the quarter. Shanghai Disney has been closed quarter-to-date, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date. As we continue to strategically prioritize leveraging our content for our own services, we expect content sales, licensing and other operating results to decrease in the third quarter by approximately $150 million to $200 million versus the prior year. The expected decrease is primarily driven by declines in content licensing along with a continued decline in home entertainment results. Direct-to-Consumer programming and production costs in Q3 are expected to increase by more than $900 million year-over-year, reflecting higher original content expense at Disney+ and Hulu increased sports rights costs and higher programming fees at Hulu Live. At Disney+, while we still expect higher net adds in the second half of the year versus the first half, it's worth mentioning that we did have a stronger-than-expected first half of the year. Additionally, note that some of the Eastern European markets were launching in towards the end of Q3, including Poland, are in regions being impacted by geopolitical factors. As it relates to content spend, we previously stated that we expect fiscal year 2022 cash content spend to total as much as $33 billion. We've adjusted that amount to as much as $32 billion to reflect a slightly slower cadence of spending than anticipated during the first half of the year. Note that we are still expecting a strong content slate in the back half of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we are confident in our long-term subscriber guidance of 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subs by fiscal 2024. We also still expect that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions. Great. Ben, your question on net adds for the second half of the year, we still do expect an increase over the first half. However, the first half came in better than expected, so that delta that we had initially anticipated may not be as large. But we still do expect an increase in the second half to exceed the first half. Hi, Michael. On the parks margins, as Bob said, we feel really good about the consumer demand and what we're seeing in the forward-looking bookings and everything else in the attendance levels. So we feel good about that portion of margins. The one that is more challenging is what we face with inflation. But we do pay close attention to all the recent inflationary pressures, and it covers everything from merchandise to food and beverage. I'll give you an example of something -- for those, we are actually always looking at mitigating impacts of rising costs. But I'll give you a good example of one that we are executing on, and that is the increased cost in fuel. We have a very robust fuel hedging program at Walt Disney World, and that reduces risk and minimizes volatility, reduces volatility in the cost of fuel. And so that -- while we suspended that program while the parks were shut, we have reopened that program and we are doing what we can to minimize the impact on that particular cost. We do have the labor impacts. Rising wages is something everybody is dealing with and a tighter labor market. On the supply chain, our business isn't immune to the global supply chain challenges. And to the extent we experience any product availability impacts given strong demand that we're seeing, we're working with our suppliers to diversify some of our suppliers, and we're also working with shippers to expedite the time to receive those through shipping. But right now, it's very difficult to accurately forecast the potential financial impact due to the fluidity of the situation. But you can trust that we are fully aware of it, and we're working hard to mitigate any pressure on the margins. Okay. Steve, to answer your question on that $32 billion of content spend and where it's going, remember back when we talked about that initially, we talked about it being about 1/3 in sports. That still remains. And when you think about the balance of that $32 billion, a meaningful amount of it will be enterprise-wide content budget that will be dedicated into investments into the general entertainment content that we can leverage across all of our various distribution platforms. When we say that, we mean linear, theatrical as well as direct-to-consumer. And as I mentioned earlier, our world-class creative teams are focused on creating content that will drive subscriber growth in targeted segments and deeper engagement across the platform. This includes leveraging our existing intellectual property. Also, we're intent on creating new franchises. You saw that in Encanto and investing in general entertainment, local language content and sports rights. I just want to -- even though you didn't ask about local language content. I do want to give you some perspective because we haven't provided this previously. But as Bob mentioned, we have about 500 shows in the pipeline for local content outside of the U.S. or English speaking. When you look at that 500, I'll give you some broad breakdowns. In the Asia Pacific region, including Southeast Asia, of that 500, 140 is in that region; in EMEA, it's 150; in India, it's 100; and in Latin America, it's 200. So we haven't given that before, but I think that also kind of breaks it up in the various regions that we are in outside of the U.S. Sure. On streaming, right now, we have not disclosed a mix or expected mix of an ad-supported tier. So we don't have any additional details on that product, and that includes pricing as well. But when we expand Disney+ across multiple price points with this new Disney+ ad tier, we are able to reach an even broader audience, and we'll create more avenues for consumer choice. And this is a consistent theme that you've heard from us, having the consumer be our North Star. We'll continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service, our brand and our core principle of providing consumers with the maximum flexibility and choice. So we expect the advertising revenue we earn will contribute positively to our ARPU as we look to achieve our long-term profitability goals. Sure. On our parks business, we're obviously extremely pleased with our domestic parks operations and how they have come back robustly. But on domestic attendance, we are -- we could, but we're choosing to limit attendance using our reservation system. And once again, that goes back to us trying to balance demand and attendance throughout the year, not have days when consumers in the parks aren't enjoying the experience. So attendance is something that we're controlling, but we're doing it to have a better consumer experience. And some of the things that we've brought back, we will continue to with additional capacity. But some capacity that we just brought back in April were things like the character meet-and-greets at our domestic parks. And we also brought back in April our Nighttime Spectaculars at the Disneyland Resort. And we'll also be opening a new attraction at Walt Disney World Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at the end of this month on Memorial Day weekend, and that is all new capacity, and we're really looking forward to having our guests experience that. Okay. On international theme parks, Doug. On Asia, I think it's really too early for us to tell. And as you heard in my comments, we said that we could see a negative impact of Hong Kong and Shanghai of $350 million in the next quarter, so just keep that in mind. But it is a bit of a tale of 2 cities. I can give you some very positive trends we're seeing out of Disneyland Paris. So just like domestically, we're seeing very strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris. And we're looking forward to its continued recovery, particularly with the recent launch of their 30th anniversary celebration. Avengers Campus, that's the first new themed area of our multiyear expansion that we've talked about previously for DLP, that will open this summer. And what has already opened is the -- one of our large hotels over there, the New York Hotel, has been re-themed in a Marvel theme and Avengers theme. So that's very exciting. And our guests love staying there. So I think it's -- what we're seeing in Paris gives me hope. Hope is not a strategy, but it gives me hope that our other parks in Asia will see that same rebound when their COVID-related headwinds abate. Well, Doug, we've said it for domestic. I -- we're not going to update that for international. There's just too much uncertainty with the region in Asia that has 2 of our parks right now. So on the incremental information you would like on our ad-supported tier, at this time, we haven't announced a price point for it. So we're not going to do that today. But we will continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service in terms of pricing. And I will say that you can look to our experience with Hulu and their ad-supported tier. We believe that this will contribute to ARPU. And we look at it as certainly something additive that will work towards achieving our long-term profitability goals."

            "name": "Bob Chapek",
            "content": "Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, Disney's employees and cast members continued to execute against our strategic priorities of storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus, and I could not be more proud of what they've achieved. Our strong results this quarter, including fantastic performance at our domestic parks and continued growth at our streaming services, along with the creative achievements of our content teams once again proved that we are in a league of our own. We have entertainment's most iconic brands and the world's favorite franchises, a high-quality creative pipeline that will continue to drive engagement and consumption and an unrivaled synergy machine with touch points that reach audiences across distribution channels, geographies and demographics, all of which come together to create a deep emotional connection with audiences across generations. I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter that illustrate these strengths, and then Christine will go through the details of our results. As I said, our domestic parks were a standout. They continue to fire on all cylinders, powered by strong demand, coupled with customized and personalized guest experience enhancements that grew per capita spending by more than 40% versus 2019. Response to next-generation storytelling like Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser has been phenomenal. In fact, guest ratings for this immersive experience, which opened March 1, are incredibly high and in line with our best-in-class offerings. Demand is strong, and we expect 100% utilization through the end of Q3. Looking ahead, we could not be more excited to officially welcome riders on Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at Epcot on May 27. One of the longest indoor rollercoasters in the world, the attraction puts guests in the middle of an exciting adventure as they're called on to help the Guardians out of a jam. With our first-ever reverse launch and rotating cars that turn riders 360 degrees, guests won't miss a second of the story during our most immersive coaster experience yet. At Disneyland Paris, we are thrilled to take the next step in our ambitious expansion plan, the opening of Avengers Campus this summer as part of the resort's 30th anniversary celebration. As Europe recovers from the pandemic, we've seen strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris and look forward to its continued recovery. Another standout this quarter were our streaming services. We ended Q2 with more than 205 million total subscriptions after adding 9.2 million in the quarter. That includes 7.9 million Disney+ subscribers, keeping us on track to reach 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by fiscal '24. The growth of the platform since its launch reinforces its unique nature. Quite simply, we believe Disney+ is one of a kind, a service based on exceptional branded content with wide appeal across all 4 quadrants. It's certainly popular with families, but as a reminder, almost half of Disney+ subscribers are adults without kids. In recognition of Disney+'s unique ability to attract viewers from a range of demographic groups, we are selectively enhancing Disney+ with general entertainment titles designed to drive sign-ups amongst specific audiences and deepen engagement amongst those cohorts. A benefit of our incredible creative engines and decades of general entertainment excellence is that we can reach these demographics not only through the creation of original titles but also by shifting resources from across our content ecosystem, especially as consumer behavior continues to evolve. Our strategy is not just to fill our distribution pipelines but to be thoughtful with each asset to best position it amongst our various distribution options. For instance, Dancing with the Stars is a beloved show that has entertained viewers for more than 30 seasons on ABC and is a wonderful example of content that brings the whole family together. We recently announced Disney+ will be the series' new home starting this fall. Beyond targeting specific demos, we are equally enthusiastic about our growth potential in international markets. We currently have over 500 local original titles in various stages of development and production. 180 of those titles are slated to premiere this fiscal year, increasing to over 300 international originals per year in steady state. We believe these premium local originals, along with branded content with broad international appeal, will attract new subscribers and drive engagement. One example in production is Nautilus from our EMEA team. Based on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Nautilus is the origin story of the iconic submarine from the perspective of its mysterious commander, Captain Nemo. This is just one example of how our global network of creative hubs can develop and produce original content with worldwide appeal. And by the end of Q3 we plan to roll out Disney+ to 53 new markets across Europe, Africa and West Asia, starting with South Africa next week. Before leaving Disney+, I want to mention our recently announced plans to introduce an ad-supported subscription offering in the U.S. by the end of the calendar year and internationally in 2023. Expanding Disney+ access through multiple price points is a win for consumers and advertisers. Of course, all of our success is rooted in great content. Our general entertainment team continued its string of phenomenal series with Hulu's Pam & Tommy and The Dropout. And while not in the quarter we could not be happier with the performance of the Kardashians. More great general entertainment content is ahead, like the second season of Only Murders in the Building on Hulu and the record-breaking 19th season of ABC's Grey's Anatomy. This quarter, our studios earned 6 Academy awards, including best Animated Feature for Walt Disney Animation Studios, Encanto; and Best Documentary Feature for Onyx Collective and Searchlight Pictures Summer of Soul. Pixar Animation Studios Turning Red premiered on March 11 on Disney+ and became the fastest title to reach 200 million hours viewed on the platform. The Disney+ original series Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett drew positive reaction from audiences, and Marvel's Moon Knight continue the studio's impressive track record. Looking ahead, our studios will continue to deliver high-quality content at scale with an exciting array of series and films coming to all of our distribution channels. In fact, our slate for the remainder of this year is incredibly strong with titles like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ms. Marvel, Lightyear, Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and the long anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water. Finally, I must mention the phenomenal success of Marvel's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which opened to roughly $450 million worldwide this past weekend. Domestically, it was the second-highest opening of the pandemic era and the 11th highest opening of all time. Our strategy of distribution flexibility has worked well for us, and these fantastic results are another sign of our ability to succeed no matter the platform. That success extends to sports. ESPN viewership was notably strong for the quarter across both live events and studio programming with ratings up double digits, and we remain encouraged by how fans are engaging with sports content coming out of the pandemic. Opening weekend of the NBA Playoffs was the most viewed in the past decade, and the ratings have been fantastic with over 4.3 million average viewers through 20 games on ABC and ESPN. Our ground-breaking NHL deal is unique in its exposure across ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, culminating with the Stanley Cup Playoffs, which began on May 2. In fact, the combination of the NHL and NBA Playoffs going on simultaneously kicks off an exciting stretch of championship programming that also includes Wimbledon, the NCAA Women's and Men's College World Series, UFC Boxing and more. Coming off the success of Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli, we recently debuted our new season-long MLB alternative broadcast, KayRod Cast with Michael Kay and Alex Rodriguez. And we began the inaugural season of PGA TOUR Live on ESPN+, featuring over 4,000 hours of live golf coverage from 35 tournaments. Before I hand it over to Christine, I want to say a few words about our unique synergy machine or franchise flywheel, if you prefer. What sets Disney apart is our ability to reach people with our uniquely engaging content across an array of touch points to make our portfolio of businesses and brands a bigger part of their lives. This enables us to not only create new franchises like Encanto, but to also build on existing IP across our lines of business. One example of this is our Toy Story franchise, which was created almost 3 decades ago with the release of the first film in 1995 and which is now brought to life across distribution platforms, geographies, businesses and time. In our parks, we've built a portfolio of 4 immersive Toy Story lands with more than 20 attractions and live character interactions available around the world as well as 2 themed hotels. The franchise is the cornerstone of Disney+ with all 4 feature-length films as well as the original short series, Forky Asks a Question, exclusively available on the service. And nearly 30 years after the film debuted, Toy Story is still a key consumer products franchise, generating over $1 billion in annual retail sales. And in just a few weeks, Pixar's Lightyear will tell the origin story of everyone's favorite Space Ranger when it hits theaters on June 17. Of course, Toy Story is just one of our many franchises, but it illustrates our unparalleled ability to bring stories to life in more ways for more people in more places. In fact, our franchise library and capabilities will continue to set us apart even further as we bring our IP to life through next-generation storytelling that is more integrated and connected across consumer touch points. As we look to our second century, that's our mission: to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger, more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine. All right. Thank you. As you know, we launch with an extremely attractive opening price point on Disney+, and we've been very comfortable with the price-value relationship that we've offered. And as you know, as we increase our content investment, we believe that that's going to give us the ability to adjust our price by -- and still, at the same time, maintain that strong value proposition. You mentioned the Disney+ ad tier I think this is going to give us the ability to reach an even more broad audience as we expand Disney+ across multiple price points. And using some of our other services, we can see the additive nature of an ad-driven service that enables us to keep the price lower. Of course, that's made up for by the additional revenue that we would get per user on the advertising spending. So we believe that we can sort of move up and cascade up our net price over time given the tremendous value that we started with and the increased price-value relationship of all the new content, but we're pretty bullish about that. Thank you. Okay. So we continue to see really strong demand, and we're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing, particularly as we're going to get some improvements to international visitation. But we're controlling our attendance, as Christine mentioned in her comments, using our reservation system to optimize the guest experience. But that domestic yield strategy, and we're also seeing it in Paris, is really exceeding our expectations. If you remember, last quarter, we mentioned that we had some high hopes for it, but we were seeing well above what we had anticipated. While I'm happy to say that in Q2 or even, as you say, we're lapping those numbers again even higher. So we're very, very encouraged by the continuation of the trends that we're seeing in terms of the number of people. For example, that sign-up for Genie+, plus the willingness to come to our parks with our balanced reservation system, which really helps us sort of manage our price per day, if you will. So that domestic yield strategy has really structurally allowed us to increase that per capita spending meaningfully without having to rely solely on raising ticket prices, and we don't see any end in sight for that. So as you know, we're very carefully watching our content growth -- content cost growth. And we reaffirmed, as you heard earlier, our targets, our guidance on both subs and on profitability. So we think they move together. It's obviously a balancing act, but we believe that great content is going to drive our subs, and those subs then in scale will drive our profitability. So we don't see them as necessarily counter. We see them as sort of consistent with the overall approach that we've laid out. We're extremely happy with the content that we've got, both across the general entertainment option, which frankly is -- you heard that 50% of our subs are families without kids. And so at the same time, that relative content expenditure is a little cheaper than our typical franchise expenditure on a per-program basis. So even though we're adding a lot of content both in local, international markets and as well in the general entertainment area, it doesn't come at the per-title level, if you will, that we've been seeing sort of to date on our general franchise films. That said, we're balancing all 3. And we're very confident that going forward, we're going to hit both of those sub guidance and profitability guidance by bringing in the cost at a reasonable level relative to their ability to attract and retain our subs. Okay. Let's see. I'm going to take the first part first. We're expecting a very positive reaction from advertisers overall. And as you suggest, this is a combination of our excitement around the Disney+ ad tier. They have been asking for this for years. And we also expect Hulu, as you know, which has been very strong for us at the same time, to be a key contributor of our performance at the upfront this year. The other thing is that sports are going to continue to be in high demand. And so with the advertisers, we focused on the right deals that we've made over the past few years as well as our robust slate of original content shows and our studio shows and original content games. In terms of sort of the growing-the-pie idea, we believe that the value proposition of advertising with Disney+ is only enhanced with our addition of an ad-supported tier on Disney+. So we believe it's good for the consumer because it's going to give us another entry price point, but it's also going to be great for the advertisers. Our advertisers increasingly are looking for multiple platforms to reach a broader reach. And we think that as a company, we're going to provide that given our portfolio of streaming and our linear networks. So I think we're creating more avenues, both for consumer choice and for comprehensive advertising solutions, for our advertising customers at the same time. Okay. So as you know, on all of our Linear Networks, they're huge cash generators for us. So to some extent, we're doing a really good job of chopping down some of the debt that we've had to accumulate due to either acquisition or through the COVID challenge. And so the hesitancy to move too fast away from those is really a cash flow situation that I think puts our company in a healthier overall situation. At the same time, we're very conscious of our ability to go more aggressively into the DTC area of ESPN. And so what we're doing is sort of putting one foot on the dock, if you will, and one foot on the boat right now. But we know that at some point when it's going to be good for our shareholders, we'll be able to fully go into an ESPN DTC offering the way that you described. And we fully believe that there is a business model there for us that's going to enable us to regain growth on ESPN+ in a full DTC expression. But at that point, obviously, that will have ramifications on immediate cash flow that we get from our legacy Linear Networks. Okay. I'm going to start with China. And the situation there has been very fluid, and as you probably guess, very complicated both from a business standpoint and from a political standpoint. But as you know, we've got a long record of success and a strong fan base for our brands and franchises in this market. And our most recent releases were Death on the Nile and Encanto. And we'll continue to submit our films for release. And it's worth noting, I think, though, that at the time that we're having some difficulty in getting our films in China that Doctor Strange did extraordinary. We've just crossed $500 million in less than a week without this market. So we're pretty confident that even without China, if it were to be that we continue to have difficulties in getting titles in there, that it doesn't really preclude our success given the relatively lower take rate that we get on the box office in China than we do across the rest of the world. Christine, do you want to talk about streaming? Okay. And on the ESPN question, we're not ready to share the specifics of our model in terms of how long it would take for us to reach profitability on that or the impact that it would have on our linear business. But I would emphasize that we're only going to do it if it's accretive to our shareholder value when it comes time to actually pull the trigger. But I can tell you that it will be the ultimate fan offering that will appeal to super fans that really love sports. And I think there's nobody but ESPN that, frankly, could actually pull that off. But we don't have a lot of specifics when it comes to structure. But we do believe that because sports is so powerful, in fact, in the last quarter, 46 of the top 50 most viewed programs on linear TV were sports. And obviously, ESPN dominates that. And I do believe that sports is the third leg of our domestic offerings in terms of our DTC offerings. And right now, that expression is through the bundle. And I think that could become very powerful for us going forward in the future. Okay. In terms of our confidence in Disney+ guidance, as you probably know, we have a tremendous amount of data that we get on our DCC platforms, things like the first view, what's the first view that somebody watches when they first come on to our platform, which is a pretty good proxy for maybe why they signed up. There's also the amount of time spent, the engagement scores and then, of course, the churn information that you sort of look at. And we've said this before in past earnings calls, but we're extraordinarily pleased with the low churn that we see, particularly given the bundle. The bundle is really efficient in terms of churn. And that gives us a lot of bullishness when it comes to the idea of bigger offerings from Disney. So as we sort of take each of these elements, when we get a new piece of content, we'll look at first view, we'll look at engagement, we'll look at the amount of time they spend on it. And we can model. We can do a lot of modeling. And that modeling suggests that in addition to things like local market content, new content coming online, both in terms of general entertainment and from franchises as well as new markets being added, that, that Disney+ guidance is going to be very achievable for us both in terms of the sub adds and in terms of the operating performance. Okay. We're in really good shape in terms of being able to meet our timing with our Disney+ ad tier. And that's largely because we're already doing it. The combination of our ESPN+, streaming tech stack and our experience in Hulu and the software, we think that our current advertising capabilities really substantially prepare us to already bring this tier into operations. So there's nothing that we need to go acquire or, frankly, even in any significant way developing anything new. And that's due to the ongoing investments in technology that we've made over time to increasingly automate much of this process. And we've been looking forward to this for a while. So this is something that's well-greased, if you will. And our teams are hard at work at making that become a reality."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I'd now like to hand the conference over to Jenn Kettnich, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Walt Disney Company. Please go ahead.\nJenn Kettnich : Good afternoon, and it's my pleasure to welcome everyone to The Walt Disney Company's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and we'll post a transcript of this call to our website. Joining me today are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll be happy to take some of your questions.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Jenn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin the final year of The Walt Disney Company's first century, I am pleased to share our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, starting with the highlights. Our adjusted EPS of $1.06 is up from $0.32 a year ago. Our Domestic Parks and Resorts achieved all-time revenue and operating income records despite the Omicron surge. And our streaming services ended Q1 with 196.4 million total subscriptions after adding 70.4 million in the quarter, including 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers. I'll share more about those items shortly. But first, I want to talk about this unique moment in the history of The Walt Disney Company. It is perhaps fitting that our 100th anniversary comes at a time of significant change for us and our industry. In the midst of a global pandemic, fast-changing consumer expectations and a leadership transition, we reimagined our Parks business, substantially increased our investment in content creation and executed a reorganization that will facilitate our ongoing transformation. Each of those actions has helped set the stage for our second century, and as we approach that remarkable milestone, I am filled with optimism. We have the world's most creative storytelling engine, an unmatched collection of brands and franchises and an ability to tell stories that form deep emotional connections with audiences. We have a portfolio of distribution platforms, including powerful and growing streaming services. We have diverse revenue streams that span business models and industries, but which all are interconnected to create entertainment's most powerful synergy machine. We have the country's top news organization and the most trusted brand for following sports and our theme parks continue to be the most magical places on earth. In short, our collection of assets and platforms, creative capabilities in unique place and the cultural zeitgeist give me great confidence that we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years. To carry through on that promise, we will be guided by three strategic pillars: storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus. Storytelling excellence is, of course, dependent on having excellent storytellers. I am thrilled to share that our legacy of being home to the most accomplished leaders in the industry will continue, as nearly all of our top creative executives have recently renewed, extended or signed new contracts. I could not be more excited to continue working with these creative powerhouses. The quality content from our teams was recognized just yesterday with a fantastic 23 Oscar nominations, including three of the five best animated feature films: Pixar's Luca; Walt Disney Animation's Raya and the Last Dragon; and our newest franchise, Walt Disney Animation's Encanto, which received three nominations. Summer of Soul was recognized in the best documentary category, and Nightmare Alley and West Side Story both received best picture nominations. As you may have seen earlier today, we announced West Side Story will debut in most Disney+ markets on March 2 and we can't wait for our subscribers to see this incredible film. In Q1, our studios took us deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Eternals and the Disney+ original series, Hawkeye. And returned us to that galaxy far, far away with another Disney+ original series of Book of Boba Fett. Our general entertainment teams also continued to produce programming of the highest quality. In fact, last year, our general entertainment team produced nearly 1/4 of the industry's best review shows. And Q1 saw 10 of their shows achieved a 100% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. That includes Abbott Elementary, the first Freshman Broadcast comedy to earn the 100% certified fresh score since ABC's own Modern Family in 2009. Our success in branded storytelling is, of course, no secret. However, it's often lost that the depth, breadth and quality of our general entertainment content is also a driving force behind the success of our streaming services. In fact, 6 of the 10 most watched programs across our services are general entertainment titles produced by our own team. And general entertainment is an increasingly powerful driver of engagement in most of our international markets where such content is already included in our service under the Star brand. Going forward, integrating more owned general entertainment into our services, especially Disney+, will be a priority. In fact, just today, we added episodes of Grown-ish, Blackish and the Wonder Years to our domestic Disney+ service. Rounding out our content focuses, is of course, sports.  Sporting events continue to be the most powerful draw in television accounting for 95 of the 100 most watched live broadcast in 2021, and ESPN once again set the bar this quarter with live games across each of our four major U.S. sports, including the revolutionary Monday Night with Peyton and Eli. And I am pleased to announce that we have expanded our agreement with Peyton Manning and its Omaha Productions Company to extend our relationship through the 2024 NFL season, and we'll add alternative presentations for UFC golf and college football events for each of the next three years. While multiplatform television and streaming will continue to be the foundation of sports coverage for the immediate future, we believe the opportunity for The Walt Disney Company goes well beyond these channels. It extends to sports betting, gaming and the metaverse. In fact, that's what excites us, the opportunity to build a sports machine akin to our franchise flywheel that enables audiences to experience, connect with and become actively engaged with our favorite sporting events, stories, teams and players. Turning to distribution results. The continued growth of our streaming services was certainly a standout. Our success at Disney+ this quarter was not the result of any one item, but instead a combination of organic growth and powerful new content, our strategic decision to include the Disney bundle with all Hulu Live subscriptions and new market launches. The remainder of this fiscal year will feature compelling Disney+ originals from across our brands and franchises, beginning with Pixar's Turning Red and Marvel Studios Moon Night in March. And the back half of FY '22 will feature a truly stunning array of content, including two Star Wars series: Andor, and the highly anticipated Obi-Wan Kenobi, which I am excited to announce will premiere on May 25. We'll debut two Marvel series, Ms. Marvel and She-Hulk; fresh new shorts from Disney Animation and Pixar, featuring the worlds of Big Hero 6 and Cars; a live-action reimagining of the Disney Classic Pinocchio, starring Tom Hanks as Geppetto; and one of the most anticipated sequels in some time, especially in the Chapek household, Hocus Pocus 2. As I've said before, we continue to manage our services for the long term and maintain confidence in our guidance of 230 million to 260 million total paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024. Christine will provide more detail into our theatrical results. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see value in the moviegoing experience, especially for big franchise blockbusters. And given the performance of titles like Spider-Man: No Way Home, we are looking forward to kicking off our summer slate with another Marvel franchise film, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. That said, audiences will be our North Star as we determine how our content is distributed. And we do not subscribe to the belief that theatrical distribution is the only way to build a Disney franchise. This quarter, audience has proved us right, as Encanto became a phenomenon within days of its arrival on Disney+ after families continued reluctance to return to theaters resulted in a muted theatrical performance. With outstanding music from Lin-Manuel Miranda, it became the fastest titled across 200 million hours viewed on Disney+ and took social media by storm. People around the world expressed their fandom through their own content and conversation and the Encanto hashtag has been viewed more than 11 billion times. The sound track, which debuted at #197 on the Billboard 200 Chart reached #1 shortly after debuting on Disney+ and 8 of the film songs hit the Hot 100 Chart, including We Don't Talk About Bruno, which became the first Disney song to reach #1 since Aladdin\u2019s Whole New World in 1993. At the same time, sales of Encanto merchandise defied traditional post-holiday declines and actually increased following the film's release on Disney+ on Christmas Eve and guests at Disney California Adventure have loved seeing Mirabel in real life. These results are exactly what you would expect from the launch of a new Disney franchise and we are thrilled that Disney+ was the catalyst. We are more confident than ever in this platform as a content service, a franchise engine and as a venue for the next generation of Disney storytelling. Finally, I could not be more pleased with the performance of our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which posted its second best quarter of all time. Over the last several years, we've transformed the guest experience by investing in new storytelling and ground-breaking technology and the records at our domestic parks are the direct result of this investment. From new franchise-based lands and attractions to craveable food and beverage offerings, the must-have character merchandise, there is more great Disney storytelling infused into every aspect of a visit to our parks than ever before. At the same time, we're giving guests new tools to personalize their visits and spend less time in line and more time having fun. While we anticipated these products would be popular, we have been blown away by the reception. In the quarter, more than 1/3 of domestic park guests purchased either Genie+, Lightning Lane or both. That number rose to more than 50% during the holiday period. While demand was strong throughout the quarter at both domestic sites, our reservation system enabled us to strategically manage attendance. In fact, their stellar performance was achieved at lower attendance levels than 2019. As we return to a more normalized environment, we look forward to more fully capitalizing on the extraordinary demand for our parks along with the already realized yield benefits that took shape this quarter. And we, of course, will continue to invest in the guest experience. I am personally looking forward to Star Wars: Galactic Star Cruiser at Walt Disney World, a 2-night adventure into the most immersive Star Wars story ever created. We are pleased with demand for this premium ground-breaking experience, which will welcome guests starting on March 1. Later this summer, we will debut an innovative new rollercoaster at EPCOT, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind and Open Avengers Campus at Disneyland Paris, where the iconic Quinjet landed a few weeks ago ahead of the resort's 30th anniversary celebrations. I want to close by thanking our 195,000 employees for bringing Disney magic to audiences and guests around the world, especially in times like these, when the world needs it most. Our company is truly extraordinary, and I am honored to work with the most talented team in the industry to create the next generation of Disney stories and experiences through our focus on storytelling excellence, innovation and our audience. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06, an increase of $0.74 from the prior year quarter. Fiscal 2022 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results and our continued progress towards more normalized operations across our businesses. At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up $2.6 billion year-over-year as all of our parks and resorts around the world were open for the entirety of the fiscal first quarter. In the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for the entire quarter, while Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris were each open for a limited number of weeks and Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. At our domestic parks, we were very pleased with the strong levels of demand we saw from both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. And as Bob mentioned, our reservation system has allowed us to strategically manage attendance. Overall, attendance trends at our domestic parks continued to strengthen in the quarter with Walt Disney World and Disneyland\u2019s Q1 attendance up double digits versus Q4, in part reflecting holiday seasonality. Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up more than 40% versus fiscal first quarter 2019 driven by a more favorable guest and ticket mix, higher food, beverage and merchandise spending and contributions from Genie+ and Lightning Light. Putting these factors together, our domestic Parks and Resorts delivered Q1 revenue and operating income exceeding pre-pandemic levels, even as we continue managing attendance to responsibly address ongoing COVID considerations. Looking ahead to Q2, our demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland remained strong, benefiting from our 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and new attractions and experiences at both parks. At International Parks, a profitable first quarter reflected improving trends at Disneyland Paris. We also saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland although the resort is now temporarily closed in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in the region. We expect International Parks will continue to be impacted by COVID-related volatility for the remainder of Q2. Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. First quarter operating income decreased by more than $600 million versus the prior year as revenue growth across our lines of business was more than offset by higher programming and production costs. Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased subscription fees from our direct-to-consumer services. We also delivered record advertising revenues for the segment as we continue to see strong advertiser demand for our live sports and streaming and digital businesses. Turning to our results by line of business. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decrease in operating income of nearly $500 million for Q1 versus the prior year. Operating income of $1.5 billion came in better than expected, primarily driven by our international channels, which I'll discuss in a minute. At our domestic channels, both Broadcasting and Cable operating income decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year. Lower results at Broadcasting were impacted by an adverse comparison to prior year political advertising revenue at our owned television stations, as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter. At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income reflected higher programming and production costs and increased marketing spend, partially offset by increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. Growth in advertising revenue was driven by ESPN as we benefited from the start of a normalized NBA calendar and increased viewership for football. ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was up 14% versus the prior year and second quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating income at our international channels decreased slightly versus the prior year. These results came in more than $200 million better than our prior guidance primarily due to lower programming and production costs as well as better-than-expected advertising and affiliate revenues. At Direct-to-Consumer, first quarter operating results decreased by $127 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ partially offset by improved results at Hulu. I'll note that beginning this quarter, we are providing disclosure on our programming and production expenses by service as well as additional detail for Disney+ in our 10-Q. Operating losses at Disney+ increased versus the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher programming, technology and marketing costs. We ended the quarter with nearly 130 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 11 million net additions from Q4. Taking a look at subscriber growth by region. We added 4.1 million paid domestic Disney+ subscribers, including a benefit of approximately 2 million incremental subscribers from our strategic decision to include Disney+ and ESPN+ as part of a Hulu Live subscription. In international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added 5.1 million paid subscribers, primarily driven by growth in Asia Pacific and European markets. I'll note that growth in Asia included the benefit of new market launches in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in the quarter. Finally, we were able to resume growth in Disney+ Hotstar markets with 2.6 million paid subscriber additions in the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with Disney+ subscriber growth in the quarter and are looking forward to new market launches and a strong content slate later this year. As I've previously shared, we don't anticipate that subscriber growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter, and we continue to expect growth in the back half of the fiscal year to exceed growth in the first half. At ESPN+, we ended the first quarter with over 21 million paid subscribers versus 17 million in Q4. Results decreased compared to the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher sports programming costs driven by the NHL and LaLiga. And at Hulu, higher subscription revenues versus the prior year were partially offset by higher programming and production costs driven by increased affiliate fees for live TV. Hulu ended the first quarter with 45.3 million paid subscribers, inclusive of 4.3 million subscribers to our Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Moving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $98 million, driven by lower theatrical results and higher film impairments, partially offset by improved TV/SVOD results. As I noted last quarter, while theatres have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged recovery to the theatrical exhibition, particularly for certain genres of films, including non-branded general entertainment and family-focused animation. This dynamic contributed to increased losses in the quarter as we released more titles in Q1 this year versus the prior year, resulting in lower theatrical results. This was partially offset by income from our coproduction of Spider-Man: No Way Home. As we look ahead, we would like to give you some context around 2 items that may impact our second quarter results. First, as we continue to increase our investment in content, we expect programming and production costs at DMED to increase versus the prior year, primarily driven by Direct-to-Consumer and Linear Networks. At Direct-to-Consumer, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $800 million to $1 billion, including programming fees for Hulu Live. At Linear Networks, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $500 million, reflecting factors including COVID-related timing shifts. We aired 4 additional NFL games at the start of the current quarter. And as a reminder, the Academy Awards will be held in Q2 of this year, while they fell into Q3 of the prior year. Second, at content sales, licensing and other, a difficult Q2 comparison to prior year TV and SVOD program sales is due in part to our strategic decision to hold more of our owned and produced content for our direct-to-consumer services. As a result, we expect operating income to be adversely impacted by more than $200 million versus the prior year quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to Jenn, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nJenn Kettnich : Thanks, Christine. As we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&A by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. [Operator Instructions]  And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Ben Swinburn with Morgan Stanley.\nBenSwinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon, and thank you for the additional disclosure. Bob, I wanted to ask you about Disney+. The U.S. subscriber base or the, I guess, the U.S. and Canadian subscriber base is larger than we would have thought. You guys have gotten to, I think, almost -- probably more than 1/3 penetrated of total broadband homes. And it's, I guess, interesting to me because it's a narrower service than the international product, which has the Star tile. So I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the runway still ahead in North America for that product. And then when you look at the international business, so leaving Hotstar aside, what does your research tell you about what the company needs to do to drive that business meaningfully higher? Because it deliver on your '24 guidance, that's really probably the biggest key is to get that sub base going. So I'm just curious, as you look at the plan, what are the things you think really can make that happen? Thank you.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Ben. So on the Disney+ U.S. side, you mentioned that we're roughly 1/3 penetrated. We still have some headroom in each one of our major franchises in terms of those viewers, those fans that have expressed interest in subscribing. So we are not nearly tapped out on each of the major franchises if someone identifies as a Lucas fan, Star Wars or as a Marvel fan or as a Disney fan. The biggest opportunity in terms of significance is with general entertainment being added to the service.  And I think you've seen just this quarter, we mentioned that today that we're adding in Grown-ish, Black-ish and a few other titles into our service. I think that will be a trend of us taking more general entertainment and moving it over to Disney+ because, as you know, about 50% -- slightly over 50% of our consumer base on Disney+ do not have kids. It's a very broad general service, of course, driven by the Disney brand and driven by families, but what we've seen time and time again is that the elasticity of Disney and its brand is much greater than we might have given it credit. And I think nowhere does this play out more, now getting into the international side of your question, than we see in Europe with the Star brand tile being the sixth brand tile within the Disney+ offering in Europe.  The other thing, though, to your question directly on international that's going to drive the international business is the predominance of local content that we are developing in order to appeal to the unique taste of each of those international markets. And I'll point out to the 340 productions that we referenced on the last call that we're developing. And by the way, we just created a new organization within our company to shepherd the development of that content, so that we can maximize the chance that we get some global hits, if you will, out of some of that local content. And so we're bullish on the future of Disney+, both domestically and internationally, driven by not only additional prevalence of titles within our major franchises, but also general entertainment and specifically in the international territories local content.\nBen Swinburne: That's super helpful, Bob. And just curious, as a follow-up, of those 300 productions or the local originals, will we see a lot of that in fiscal '22 come on the service?\nBob Chapek: Yes. That's the slate that comes on, I think, over the next 1.5 years, next 1.5 years to 2 years. So I don't exactly know the percent that will fall within the context of this year. But we started this initiative about a year ago, and I must say it's actually extraordinary how great the content is that's being developed in the international territories.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you.\nJenn Kettnich: Thanks, Ben, for the question. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Nathanson: Hey, thanks Bob. Going on that same part about international Disney+. Can you talk about what role the sports play, maybe even outside of India? So what are you seeing in Latin America? Does that help close the gap? And in general, how do you consider maybe loss leading with sports versus pulling back on sports and investing in more of your own content? Thanks.\nBob Chapek: The sports proposition internationally really varies by market. As you know, in Europe, it's not a big component for us, but in Latin America, it actually is. And our -- the way that we've gone to market in each territory, one of the differences between how we go to market in Asia versus how we go to market in Latin America versus how we go to market in Europe is a function of sports. That's a really big piece of it. And where you see like in Latin America where we've got a very big percentage of our consumers that are subscribing to our services because of sports, it's a bigger component to that. Sports for us are -- it's a very important strategic offering because the fandom and the passion is so deep. If you look at India, we're certainly going to try to extend our rights on the IPL. But we're very confident that even if we were not to go ahead and win that auction that we would still be able to achieve our 230 to 260. So it's an important component for us around the world. Obviously really important in India, but not critical to us achieving the 230 to 260 number that we've guided to.\nMichael Nathanson: Thank you.\nJenn Kettnich: Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So Bob, if I could just follow-up on that comment on IPL. Hotstar was about 40% of your long-term guide and without cricket, getting to that number seems like a little bit tougher to do, just given the popularity of the sport in the country and also the fact that Hotstar has been in the country for a long time as a localized service. So just wanted to see what bridges that gap to your guidance if -- in the scenario that you don't end up getting Hotstar? And then beyond that, maybe -- sorry, go ahead, Bob.\nBob Chapek: No, no, go ahead, please.\nKannan Venkateshwar: So Christine, from a guidance perspective, I guess the other variable is just a breakeven guidance in 2024 for the streaming service. And you did talk about content spend being at least $8 billion to $9 billion in that year last quarter. So just given the growth in entertainment content locally around the world as well as some of the investments in sports in Latin America and potentially an increase in cost in India, could you just frame what kind of upside we could see to that content spend budget? Any framework in terms of how to think about it would be useful? Thanks.\nJenn Kettnich: Bob, do you want to start off on the IPL and Christine can chime in with some more detail on that and the breakeven guidance in content spend?\nBob Chapek: Sure, sure. So while the IPL obviously, is an important part of the Disney+ Hotstar content offering, it's really one component of a broader portfolio of entertainment and sports. In addition to, obviously, the original content and the library content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and Nat Geo, our Disney+ Hotstar offering does have a massive collection of local content, and we add over 18,000 hours of original programming every year. So while certainly it's an important component, that local content that we're developing really will mitigate the impact of us if we were not to win the auction on IPL. So an important component, but it's not like we see that business evaporating if we don't get it. Christine?\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Kannan, on your question on the breakeven guidance and on Disney+ content spend. We're not updating the guidance. We have that fiscal '24 guidance out in the marketplace, and we're sticking to it. We're not yet at a steady state of content expense for Disney+, but we expect to have made significant progress by fiscal 2023.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jessica Reif Erlich with Bank of America Securities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Maybe switching gears to Theme Parks. The leverage in that business is ginormous as we've seen in this quarter. Would you consider the 34% operating income margin peak margin? And then just maybe some color because international visitors really haven't come back, we know they stay longer and spend more. Have you gotten all of the technology improvements that you expect? And within that, with some of the changes that you made in the park, it sounds like you're actually improving capacity. So how should we think about capacity now versus what it was prior to COVID?\nBob Chapek: Christine, do you want that one on the margins?\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. I would say we've been saying this all along through the pandemic, where we have taken measures to really look at the cost base and how we're doing things. And there's been a fundamental shift in some of the operational processes that the parks had used for many, many years and things like the ability to do mobile dining or not having to check in with the human being at a hotel, those kinds of things are all things that add to upside that we have at the parks. And as you mentioned, Jessica, we haven't yet seen the return of our international guests. And remember, historically, and we always hit this historical boundary of our band of 18% to 22% of our Walt Disney World guests came from outside of the U.S., and they haven\u2019t even yet started to return.  So I think there's a lot of things that are boding well, and we saw the performance this quarter of Genie and at the other things like Lightning Lane, but it's not just that. It's also really compelling offerings in food, beverage, merchandise. And it's really great to see not only creativity in our content business, but creativity at our parks as well. And that's driving some of that incremental spending that's certainly helping the margins get to that level that we've seen this quarter.\nJenn Kettnich: All right. Thanks for the question, Jessica.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman : I believe we're going to be coming up on an anniversary of the first price change that you had for the Disney+ service. And so I was hoping you could give us some insight in terms of how you're thinking about pricing strategy for the product going forward? And what are the key things that influence that in terms of timing, when you bring new content on, distribution partners or anything else we should be thinking about as we model out ARPU?\nBob Chapek: Christine, I'll start with this. And if you want to augment, please do. We maintain that we offer an extraordinary price value relationship around the world for Disney+. Obviously, the last few years, pretty much the entirety of the launch of Disney+ have been plagued by COVID-related production interruptions. Plus in all fairness, our own recognition that we needed to essentially double our production output. You put those 2 things together, and we certainly have less content than we want. But as we've said over the last few earnings calls, that will rectify itself in the second half of this year, we've already reached 1 of our 2 goals. One of the goals was to go ahead and ensure that we had a new title every week, and we've achieved that. But by '23, we want to get to a steady state, which is even higher than we have right now. And I think that will give us the impetus to increase that price value relationship even higher and then have the flexibility if we were to so choose to then look at price increases on our service. But it's all about content, content, content and we are bullish about our future content going forward, not only in terms of quality, but also in terms of quantity. And that's really what's driving our bullishness for what we might see as the pricing power that we would have going forward.\nChristine McCarthy: Brett. The only other thing I would add to that is that we are still only less than 2.5 years into this business, and we're learning a lot about what consumers are watching, consumption patterns, repeatability and all of those things will factor into when we look at the -- as Bob mentioned, the price value equation going forward. So as we learn more, we'll continue to refine the business model.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDougMitchelson: I'd echo Ben's appreciation of the extra streaming details. I guess a couple of questions. Latin America was not mentioned. And I know on the last conference call, there was a discussion of working with distributors on Star post launch to improve traction there. Is there any story as to why there was pretty good success here in Europe and Asia Pac, but a little bit less so in Latin America?  And then probably for Christine, but on the Direct-to-Consumer programming cost increase that you highlighted for fiscal 2Q, I'm not sure if there's more context there, but also can we think about the next couple of quarters thereafter to be something in a similar range? Certainly, the fourth quarter was already highlighted as a quarter where we're going to see a lot of fresh original programming. Anything that could sort of help us shape out the year on that regard would be helpful.\nJenn Kettnich: Thanks, Doug, for the question. Bob, do you want to start off on LatAm or international subs and then Christine, you can add to that.\nBob Chapek: Yes, I will. I'll talk about LatAm because it kind of goes back a little bit to this live sports story that was questioned earlier. We're actually encouraged by what we see in LatAm, especially given the straight of that Live Sports calendar and a growing pipeline of local original productions. I mean, the reason why we're doing so many local productions because we know what their power is in those localized markets. And we're also encouraged that we're seeing a dynamic that we also see in the U.S., which is the vast majority of the sign-ups that came this quarter came from the Combo Plus. In other words, it's the bundle. And so we're starting to see LatAm sort of pick up some of the same characteristics that we see in domestic. When we started off in LatAm, just like we did with Disney+, it was a little bit slower, but they always seem to keep -- kind of a catch-up, if you will. And we believe in the strength of our local originals and those 2,000 live sporting events that we program each month. Our growing wholesale footprint, you talked about partnerships. That's an important part, particularly in Latin America, that wholesale footprint and new promotional offers that we are testing in the marketplace. So we think that the combination of those things plus our ability to migrate our customers from our linear channels to their digital channels really gives us reason to be fairly bullish in Latin America right now. And Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Doug, the question on Disney+ programming. We expect to -- for the full year spend on content to be -- including sports rights to be as much as that $33 billion in total. The increase from year-over-year is more spending on our DTC expansion. And this also assumes there is no significant production delays and things could happen for things other than COVID as well. We had a couple of productions that did get delayed for other reasons. But when you think about -- your comment on our heavy slate of content coming to the service in the fourth quarter is true. But remember, the spending for that is before then. So you'll continue to see increased spending this year. And when you're looking at that $33 billion, I think it's also informative to take into account that about 1/3 of that is for sports rights, including the programming and production, but primarily it's the sports right. So if you want to think about the total $33 billion, take out 1/3 for sports and the remainder is for content. Not all on Disney+, some of that's for Hulu as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim.\nMichael Morris: I wanted to ask you one about Hulu and just follow up on the parks. On Hulu, the SVOD ARPU was down a bit year-over-year. You guys cited the lower per subscriber ad revenue. I'm hoping you could talk a little bit more about what's driving that. Is engagement down? Is pricing down? I know there's been some talk of some content that may be coming off the service. So if you could expand on that a bit, that would be helpful. And then second, I just want to follow up on the earlier question about capacity at the parks and whether that has expanded through the cycle. So I'm just trying to think about the runway given how strong the per caps have been and we can kind of do the math on how much attendance went down and how much you've reported, it's come back. But I'm curious if you can give us any more perspective on whether we can exceed or by how much we could exceed those prior attendance levels.\nJenn Kettnich: Bob, do you want to start off on parks then Christine can touch on Hulu SVOD ARPU?\nBob Chapek: Okay. I'll start off on parks. So the issue or the question of capacity at parks is a bit of a complex one because it's driven by several different dynamics. First of all, we've got really strong domestic demand, as we've said, mitigated a little bit by a lagged return from the international markets. Now that in itself is expected because the booking timetable is so long on international trips. So we believe that will come up and enable us to get closer to where we would have been in the past. But in terms of sort of the self-management capacity, one of the last things to come back for us in a post-COVID world -- what we hope is a post-COVID world, is actually live entertainment because much of the live entertainment is close proximity. And we are self-regulating that. We are self-managing that because we don't want our guests to feel an excessive level of density. And the place that you get it is parades and firework shows and things like that. So I suspect that over time, we'll start to regain some of the capacity drop-off that where it's kind of self-imposing on ourselves. The other thing I should say is that, to a certain extent, because people spend such a long time in our parks and resorts, the food and beverage component is actually a pretty big one of those. And if there's -- we really haven't had too big of an issue in terms of retaining and attracting people into our parks -- to work into our parks at all. As a matter of fact, we had 85% of our cast members pretty much say, yes, immediately, when we ask them back. But at the same time, the 2 areas that have been difficult is hospitality, and right now, we've got 90% of our hotels at Walt Disney World open and we've got all of our hotels at Disneyland open, but also sort of cooks, I think kind of short order cooks. And so the capacity constraints, the self-imposed capacity constraints are really a function of our food and beverage sort of mitigation, if you will. But the second one is live entertainment, and we're working towards restoring both of those so that we can get up to something that would be more similar to what we've seen in the past in terms of the number of people we put into our parks. But I must tell you that our ability to increase our guest experience through a very -- a reservation system in a very carefully managed demand ticketing system has been something that we really like. And I think guaranteeing our guests that they have a great experience no matter when they come, whether it be the Christmas holiday or whether it be in the middle of the month of September, that's really important to us. And so we're going to self-manage as to optimize the guest experience. But at the same time, we know we firmly got some headroom, whether it's due to international or whether it's due to an expansion and reinstatement of things like live entertainment.\nChristine McCarthy: Great. And Mike, your question on the Hulu SVOD ARPU. Let me just start with advertiser demand because I think this is an important concept. It's incredibly robust for advertising on Hulu. We're able to use our data. We offer targeted advertising. Some people call it addressable. We've built a unified ad platform across all of our businesses that do utilize advertising. So we're seeing that as being a growth business for us and are very, very pleased with it. On this particular question on the ARPU for Hulu. In the quarter, we benefited growth from some high-impact promotional offers during the quarter on Black Friday. There was one that went into the market. Those particular subscribers are showing high rates of engagement and the conversion of them from the promo to the full price, we're pretty optimistic of that given their engagement levels. So while it was down, you could view it as this was an offering to get people to sample the product. And the -- it seems like the product is being certainly appreciated. And we're hoping for those to once again convert to full paid subscribers\nOperator: This question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: I just had one long-term question. You guys have done so well over the years in terms of running theme parks world-class and storytelling as you alluded to. The one area where I think Disney has sort of struggled a little bit has been with software development. And as you think about sports betting and the metaverse, it just seems like strategically, that's going to become potentially a more important piece of your core competency going forward. Is that sort of top of mind? Or do you think that's sort of not a correct way to think about sort of the muscles that you guys need to build over the next 5 years?\nJenn Kettnich: Jason, I think you're cutting in and out, but I think we got the gist of the question. Bob, do you want to take that one?\nBob Chapek: Yes, yes. I think I got the gist of it. It is top of mind. It is absolutely top of mind because we realize that in the future, you can call it what you want. You want to call it metaverse, you want to call it the blending of the physical and digital experiences, which I think Disney should excel at for all the reasons that you said in your opening. We realize that it's going to be less of a passive type experience where you just have playback whether it's a sporting event or whether it's an entertainment offering and more of an interactive lean forward, actively engaged type experience. And this is a very top of mind thing for us because we are continuing over time to augment our skills and the types of people that we attract into The Walt Disney Company to reflect the aggressive and ambitious technology agenda that we have. You probably noticed that one of my 3 pillars is innovation and specifically technological innovation because we realize that this is going to be an important part of telling story in that third dimension that lean forward Interactive dimension. So it is absolutely top of mind.\nJenn Kettnich: Okay. Thanks for the question, and we want to thank everyone for joining us today.

            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06, an increase of $0.74 from the prior year quarter. Fiscal 2022 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results and our continued progress towards more normalized operations across our businesses. At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up $2.6 billion year-over-year as all of our parks and resorts around the world were open for the entirety of the fiscal first quarter. In the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for the entire quarter, while Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris were each open for a limited number of weeks and Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. At our domestic parks, we were very pleased with the strong levels of demand we saw from both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. And as Bob mentioned, our reservation system has allowed us to strategically manage attendance. Overall, attendance trends at our domestic parks continued to strengthen in the quarter with Walt Disney World and Disneyland's Q1 attendance up double digits versus Q4, in part reflecting holiday seasonality. Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up more than 40% versus fiscal first quarter 2019 driven by a more favorable guest and ticket mix, higher food, beverage and merchandise spending and contributions from Genie+ and Lightning Light. Putting these factors together, our domestic Parks and Resorts delivered Q1 revenue and operating income exceeding pre-pandemic levels, even as we continue managing attendance to responsibly address ongoing COVID considerations. Looking ahead to Q2, our demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland remained strong, benefiting from our 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and new attractions and experiences at both parks. At International Parks, a profitable first quarter reflected improving trends at Disneyland Paris. We also saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland although the resort is now temporarily closed in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in the region. We expect International Parks will continue to be impacted by COVID-related volatility for the remainder of Q2. Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. First quarter operating income decreased by more than $600 million versus the prior year as revenue growth across our lines of business was more than offset by higher programming and production costs. Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased subscription fees from our direct-to-consumer services. We also delivered record advertising revenues for the segment as we continue to see strong advertiser demand for our live sports and streaming and digital businesses. Turning to our results by line of business. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decrease in operating income of nearly $500 million for Q1 versus the prior year. Operating income of $1.5 billion came in better than expected, primarily driven by our international channels, which I'll discuss in a minute. At our domestic channels, both Broadcasting and Cable operating income decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year. Lower results at Broadcasting were impacted by an adverse comparison to prior year political advertising revenue at our owned television stations, as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter. At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income reflected higher programming and production costs and increased marketing spend, partially offset by increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. Growth in advertising revenue was driven by ESPN as we benefited from the start of a normalized NBA calendar and increased viewership for football. ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was up 14% versus the prior year and second quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating income at our international channels decreased slightly versus the prior year. These results came in more than $200 million better than our prior guidance primarily due to lower programming and production costs as well as better-than-expected advertising and affiliate revenues. At Direct-to-Consumer, first quarter operating results decreased by $127 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ partially offset by improved results at Hulu. I'll note that beginning this quarter, we are providing disclosure on our programming and production expenses by service as well as additional detail for Disney+ in our 10-Q. Operating losses at Disney+ increased versus the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher programming, technology and marketing costs. We ended the quarter with nearly 130 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 11 million net additions from Q4. Taking a look at subscriber growth by region. We added 4.1 million paid domestic Disney+ subscribers, including a benefit of approximately 2 million incremental subscribers from our strategic decision to include Disney+ and ESPN+ as part of a Hulu Live subscription. In international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added 5.1 million paid subscribers, primarily driven by growth in Asia Pacific and European markets. I'll note that growth in Asia included the benefit of new market launches in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in the quarter. Finally, we were able to resume growth in Disney+ Hotstar markets with 2.6 million paid subscriber additions in the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with Disney+ subscriber growth in the quarter and are looking forward to new market launches and a strong content slate later this year. As I've previously shared, we don't anticipate that subscriber growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter, and we continue to expect growth in the back half of the fiscal year to exceed growth in the first half. At ESPN+, we ended the first quarter with over 21 million paid subscribers versus 17 million in Q4. Results decreased compared to the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher sports programming costs driven by the NHL and LaLiga. And at Hulu, higher subscription revenues versus the prior year were partially offset by higher programming and production costs driven by increased affiliate fees for live TV. Hulu ended the first quarter with 45.3 million paid subscribers, inclusive of 4.3 million subscribers to our Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Moving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $98 million, driven by lower theatrical results and higher film impairments, partially offset by improved TV/SVOD results. As I noted last quarter, while theatres have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged recovery to the theatrical exhibition, particularly for certain genres of films, including non-branded general entertainment and family-focused animation. This dynamic contributed to increased losses in the quarter as we released more titles in Q1 this year versus the prior year, resulting in lower theatrical results. This was partially offset by income from our coproduction of Spider-Man: No Way Home. As we look ahead, we would like to give you some context around 2 items that may impact our second quarter results. First, as we continue to increase our investment in content, we expect programming and production costs at DMED to increase versus the prior year, primarily driven by Direct-to-Consumer and Linear Networks. At Direct-to-Consumer, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $800 million to $1 billion, including programming fees for Hulu Live. At Linear Networks, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $500 million, reflecting factors including COVID-related timing shifts. We aired 4 additional NFL games at the start of the current quarter. And as a reminder, the Academy Awards will be held in Q2 of this year, while they fell into Q3 of the prior year. Second, at content sales, licensing and other, a difficult Q2 comparison to prior year TV and SVOD program sales is due in part to our strategic decision to hold more of our owned and produced content for our direct-to-consumer services. As a result, we expect operating income to be adversely impacted by more than $200 million versus the prior year quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to Jenn, and we would be happy to take your questions. Okay. Kannan, on your question on the breakeven guidance and on Disney+ content spend. We're not updating the guidance. We have that fiscal '24 guidance out in the marketplace, and we're sticking to it. We're not yet at a steady state of content expense for Disney+, but we expect to have made significant progress by fiscal 2023. Sure. I would say we've been saying this all along through the pandemic, where we have taken measures to really look at the cost base and how we're doing things. And there's been a fundamental shift in some of the operational processes that the parks had used for many, many years and things like the ability to do mobile dining or not having to check in with the human being at a hotel, those kinds of things are all things that add to upside that we have at the parks. And as you mentioned, Jessica, we haven't yet seen the return of our international guests. And remember, historically, and we always hit this historical boundary of our band of 18% to 22% of our Walt Disney World guests came from outside of the U.S., and they haven't even yet started to return.  So I think there's a lot of things that are boding well, and we saw the performance this quarter of Genie and at the other things like Lightning Lane, but it's not just that. It's also really compelling offerings in food, beverage, merchandise. And it's really great to see not only creativity in our content business, but creativity at our parks as well. And that's driving some of that incremental spending that's certainly helping the margins get to that level that we've seen this quarter. Brett. The only other thing I would add to that is that we are still only less than 2.5 years into this business, and we're learning a lot about what consumers are watching, consumption patterns, repeatability and all of those things will factor into when we look at the -- as Bob mentioned, the price value equation going forward. So as we learn more, we'll continue to refine the business model. Doug, the question on Disney+ programming. We expect to -- for the full year spend on content to be -- including sports rights to be as much as that $33 billion in total. The increase from year-over-year is more spending on our DTC expansion. And this also assumes there is no significant production delays and things could happen for things other than COVID as well. We had a couple of productions that did get delayed for other reasons. But when you think about -- your comment on our heavy slate of content coming to the service in the fourth quarter is true. But remember, the spending for that is before then. So you'll continue to see increased spending this year. And when you're looking at that $33 billion, I think it's also informative to take into account that about 1/3 of that is for sports rights, including the programming and production, but primarily it's the sports right. So if you want to think about the total $33 billion, take out 1/3 for sports and the remainder is for content. Not all on Disney+, some of that's for Hulu as well. Great. And Mike, your question on the Hulu SVOD ARPU. Let me just start with advertiser demand because I think this is an important concept. It's incredibly robust for advertising on Hulu. We're able to use our data. We offer targeted advertising. Some people call it addressable. We've built a unified ad platform across all of our businesses that do utilize advertising. So we're seeing that as being a growth business for us and are very, very pleased with it. On this particular question on the ARPU for Hulu. In the quarter, we benefited growth from some high-impact promotional offers during the quarter on Black Friday. There was one that went into the market. Those particular subscribers are showing high rates of engagement and the conversion of them from the promo to the full price, we're pretty optimistic of that given their engagement levels. So while it was down, you could view it as this was an offering to get people to sample the product. And the -- it seems like the product is being certainly appreciated. And we're hoping for those to once again convert to full paid subscribers"

            "name": "Bob Chapek",
            "content": "Thanks, Jenn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin the final year of The Walt Disney Company's first century, I am pleased to share our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, starting with the highlights. Our adjusted EPS of $1.06 is up from $0.32 a year ago. Our Domestic Parks and Resorts achieved all-time revenue and operating income records despite the Omicron surge. And our streaming services ended Q1 with 196.4 million total subscriptions after adding 70.4 million in the quarter, including 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers. I'll share more about those items shortly. But first, I want to talk about this unique moment in the history of The Walt Disney Company. It is perhaps fitting that our 100th anniversary comes at a time of significant change for us and our industry. In the midst of a global pandemic, fast-changing consumer expectations and a leadership transition, we reimagined our Parks business, substantially increased our investment in content creation and executed a reorganization that will facilitate our ongoing transformation. Each of those actions has helped set the stage for our second century, and as we approach that remarkable milestone, I am filled with optimism. We have the world's most creative storytelling engine, an unmatched collection of brands and franchises and an ability to tell stories that form deep emotional connections with audiences. We have a portfolio of distribution platforms, including powerful and growing streaming services. We have diverse revenue streams that span business models and industries, but which all are interconnected to create entertainment's most powerful synergy machine. We have the country's top news organization and the most trusted brand for following sports and our theme parks continue to be the most magical places on earth. In short, our collection of assets and platforms, creative capabilities in unique place and the cultural zeitgeist give me great confidence that we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years. To carry through on that promise, we will be guided by three strategic pillars: storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus. Storytelling excellence is, of course, dependent on having excellent storytellers. I am thrilled to share that our legacy of being home to the most accomplished leaders in the industry will continue, as nearly all of our top creative executives have recently renewed, extended or signed new contracts. I could not be more excited to continue working with these creative powerhouses. The quality content from our teams was recognized just yesterday with a fantastic 23 Oscar nominations, including three of the five best animated feature films: Pixar's Luca; Walt Disney Animation's Raya and the Last Dragon; and our newest franchise, Walt Disney Animation's Encanto, which received three nominations. Summer of Soul was recognized in the best documentary category, and Nightmare Alley and West Side Story both received best picture nominations. As you may have seen earlier today, we announced West Side Story will debut in most Disney+ markets on March 2 and we can't wait for our subscribers to see this incredible film. In Q1, our studios took us deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Eternals and the Disney+ original series, Hawkeye. And returned us to that galaxy far, far away with another Disney+ original series of Book of Boba Fett. Our general entertainment teams also continued to produce programming of the highest quality. In fact, last year, our general entertainment team produced nearly 1/4 of the industry's best review shows. And Q1 saw 10 of their shows achieved a 100% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. That includes Abbott Elementary, the first Freshman Broadcast comedy to earn the 100% certified fresh score since ABC's own Modern Family in 2009. Our success in branded storytelling is, of course, no secret. However, it's often lost that the depth, breadth and quality of our general entertainment content is also a driving force behind the success of our streaming services. In fact, 6 of the 10 most watched programs across our services are general entertainment titles produced by our own team. And general entertainment is an increasingly powerful driver of engagement in most of our international markets where such content is already included in our service under the Star brand. Going forward, integrating more owned general entertainment into our services, especially Disney+, will be a priority. In fact, just today, we added episodes of Grown-ish, Blackish and the Wonder Years to our domestic Disney+ service. Rounding out our content focuses, is of course, sports.  Sporting events continue to be the most powerful draw in television accounting for 95 of the 100 most watched live broadcast in 2021, and ESPN once again set the bar this quarter with live games across each of our four major U.S. sports, including the revolutionary Monday Night with Peyton and Eli. And I am pleased to announce that we have expanded our agreement with Peyton Manning and its Omaha Productions Company to extend our relationship through the 2024 NFL season, and we'll add alternative presentations for UFC golf and college football events for each of the next three years. While multiplatform television and streaming will continue to be the foundation of sports coverage for the immediate future, we believe the opportunity for The Walt Disney Company goes well beyond these channels. It extends to sports betting, gaming and the metaverse. In fact, that's what excites us, the opportunity to build a sports machine akin to our franchise flywheel that enables audiences to experience, connect with and become actively engaged with our favorite sporting events, stories, teams and players. Turning to distribution results. The continued growth of our streaming services was certainly a standout. Our success at Disney+ this quarter was not the result of any one item, but instead a combination of organic growth and powerful new content, our strategic decision to include the Disney bundle with all Hulu Live subscriptions and new market launches. The remainder of this fiscal year will feature compelling Disney+ originals from across our brands and franchises, beginning with Pixar's Turning Red and Marvel Studios Moon Night in March. And the back half of FY '22 will feature a truly stunning array of content, including two Star Wars series: Andor, and the highly anticipated Obi-Wan Kenobi, which I am excited to announce will premiere on May 25. We'll debut two Marvel series, Ms. Marvel and She-Hulk; fresh new shorts from Disney Animation and Pixar, featuring the worlds of Big Hero 6 and Cars; a live-action reimagining of the Disney Classic Pinocchio, starring Tom Hanks as Geppetto; and one of the most anticipated sequels in some time, especially in the Chapek household, Hocus Pocus 2. As I've said before, we continue to manage our services for the long term and maintain confidence in our guidance of 230 million to 260 million total paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024. Christine will provide more detail into our theatrical results. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see value in the moviegoing experience, especially for big franchise blockbusters. And given the performance of titles like Spider-Man: No Way Home, we are looking forward to kicking off our summer slate with another Marvel franchise film, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. That said, audiences will be our North Star as we determine how our content is distributed. And we do not subscribe to the belief that theatrical distribution is the only way to build a Disney franchise. This quarter, audience has proved us right, as Encanto became a phenomenon within days of its arrival on Disney+ after families continued reluctance to return to theaters resulted in a muted theatrical performance. With outstanding music from Lin-Manuel Miranda, it became the fastest titled across 200 million hours viewed on Disney+ and took social media by storm. People around the world expressed their fandom through their own content and conversation and the Encanto hashtag has been viewed more than 11 billion times. The sound track, which debuted at #197 on the Billboard 200 Chart reached #1 shortly after debuting on Disney+ and 8 of the film songs hit the Hot 100 Chart, including We Don't Talk About Bruno, which became the first Disney song to reach #1 since Aladdin's Whole New World in 1993. At the same time, sales of Encanto merchandise defied traditional post-holiday declines and actually increased following the film's release on Disney+ on Christmas Eve and guests at Disney California Adventure have loved seeing Mirabel in real life. These results are exactly what you would expect from the launch of a new Disney franchise and we are thrilled that Disney+ was the catalyst. We are more confident than ever in this platform as a content service, a franchise engine and as a venue for the next generation of Disney storytelling. Finally, I could not be more pleased with the performance of our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which posted its second best quarter of all time. Over the last several years, we've transformed the guest experience by investing in new storytelling and ground-breaking technology and the records at our domestic parks are the direct result of this investment. From new franchise-based lands and attractions to craveable food and beverage offerings, the must-have character merchandise, there is more great Disney storytelling infused into every aspect of a visit to our parks than ever before. At the same time, we're giving guests new tools to personalize their visits and spend less time in line and more time having fun. While we anticipated these products would be popular, we have been blown away by the reception. In the quarter, more than 1/3 of domestic park guests purchased either Genie+, Lightning Lane or both. That number rose to more than 50% during the holiday period. While demand was strong throughout the quarter at both domestic sites, our reservation system enabled us to strategically manage attendance. In fact, their stellar performance was achieved at lower attendance levels than 2019. As we return to a more normalized environment, we look forward to more fully capitalizing on the extraordinary demand for our parks along with the already realized yield benefits that took shape this quarter. And we, of course, will continue to invest in the guest experience. I am personally looking forward to Star Wars: Galactic Star Cruiser at Walt Disney World, a 2-night adventure into the most immersive Star Wars story ever created. We are pleased with demand for this premium ground-breaking experience, which will welcome guests starting on March 1. Later this summer, we will debut an innovative new rollercoaster at EPCOT, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind and Open Avengers Campus at Disneyland Paris, where the iconic Quinjet landed a few weeks ago ahead of the resort's 30th anniversary celebrations. I want to close by thanking our 195,000 employees for bringing Disney magic to audiences and guests around the world, especially in times like these, when the world needs it most. Our company is truly extraordinary, and I am honored to work with the most talented team in the industry to create the next generation of Disney stories and experiences through our focus on storytelling excellence, innovation and our audience. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine. Thanks, Ben. So on the Disney+ U.S. side, you mentioned that we're roughly 1/3 penetrated. We still have some headroom in each one of our major franchises in terms of those viewers, those fans that have expressed interest in subscribing. So we are not nearly tapped out on each of the major franchises if someone identifies as a Lucas fan, Star Wars or as a Marvel fan or as a Disney fan. The biggest opportunity in terms of significance is with general entertainment being added to the service.  And I think you've seen just this quarter, we mentioned that today that we're adding in Grown-ish, Black-ish and a few other titles into our service. I think that will be a trend of us taking more general entertainment and moving it over to Disney+ because, as you know, about 50% -- slightly over 50% of our consumer base on Disney+ do not have kids. It's a very broad general service, of course, driven by the Disney brand and driven by families, but what we've seen time and time again is that the elasticity of Disney and its brand is much greater than we might have given it credit. And I think nowhere does this play out more, now getting into the international side of your question, than we see in Europe with the Star brand tile being the sixth brand tile within the Disney+ offering in Europe.  The other thing, though, to your question directly on international that's going to drive the international business is the predominance of local content that we are developing in order to appeal to the unique taste of each of those international markets. And I'll point out to the 340 productions that we referenced on the last call that we're developing. And by the way, we just created a new organization within our company to shepherd the development of that content, so that we can maximize the chance that we get some global hits, if you will, out of some of that local content. And so we're bullish on the future of Disney+, both domestically and internationally, driven by not only additional prevalence of titles within our major franchises, but also general entertainment and specifically in the international territories local content. Yes. That's the slate that comes on, I think, over the next 1.5 years, next 1.5 years to 2 years. So I don't exactly know the percent that will fall within the context of this year. But we started this initiative about a year ago, and I must say it's actually extraordinary how great the content is that's being developed in the international territories. The sports proposition internationally really varies by market. As you know, in Europe, it's not a big component for us, but in Latin America, it actually is. And our -- the way that we've gone to market in each territory, one of the differences between how we go to market in Asia versus how we go to market in Latin America versus how we go to market in Europe is a function of sports. That's a really big piece of it. And where you see like in Latin America where we've got a very big percentage of our consumers that are subscribing to our services because of sports, it's a bigger component to that. Sports for us are -- it's a very important strategic offering because the fandom and the passion is so deep. If you look at India, we're certainly going to try to extend our rights on the IPL. But we're very confident that even if we were not to go ahead and win that auction that we would still be able to achieve our 230 to 260. So it's an important component for us around the world. Obviously really important in India, but not critical to us achieving the 230 to 260 number that we've guided to. No, no, go ahead, please. Sure, sure. So while the IPL obviously, is an important part of the Disney+ Hotstar content offering, it's really one component of a broader portfolio of entertainment and sports. In addition to, obviously, the original content and the library content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and Nat Geo, our Disney+ Hotstar offering does have a massive collection of local content, and we add over 18,000 hours of original programming every year. So while certainly it's an important component, that local content that we're developing really will mitigate the impact of us if we were not to win the auction on IPL. So an important component, but it's not like we see that business evaporating if we don't get it. Christine? Christine, do you want that one on the margins? Christine, I'll start with this. And if you want to augment, please do. We maintain that we offer an extraordinary price value relationship around the world for Disney+. Obviously, the last few years, pretty much the entirety of the launch of Disney+ have been plagued by COVID-related production interruptions. Plus in all fairness, our own recognition that we needed to essentially double our production output. You put those 2 things together, and we certainly have less content than we want. But as we've said over the last few earnings calls, that will rectify itself in the second half of this year, we've already reached 1 of our 2 goals. One of the goals was to go ahead and ensure that we had a new title every week, and we've achieved that. But by '23, we want to get to a steady state, which is even higher than we have right now. And I think that will give us the impetus to increase that price value relationship even higher and then have the flexibility if we were to so choose to then look at price increases on our service. But it's all about content, content, content and we are bullish about our future content going forward, not only in terms of quality, but also in terms of quantity. And that's really what's driving our bullishness for what we might see as the pricing power that we would have going forward. Yes, I will. I'll talk about LatAm because it kind of goes back a little bit to this live sports story that was questioned earlier. We're actually encouraged by what we see in LatAm, especially given the straight of that Live Sports calendar and a growing pipeline of local original productions. I mean, the reason why we're doing so many local productions because we know what their power is in those localized markets. And we're also encouraged that we're seeing a dynamic that we also see in the U.S., which is the vast majority of the sign-ups that came this quarter came from the Combo Plus. In other words, it's the bundle. And so we're starting to see LatAm sort of pick up some of the same characteristics that we see in domestic. When we started off in LatAm, just like we did with Disney+, it was a little bit slower, but they always seem to keep -- kind of a catch-up, if you will. And we believe in the strength of our local originals and those 2,000 live sporting events that we program each month. Our growing wholesale footprint, you talked about partnerships. That's an important part, particularly in Latin America, that wholesale footprint and new promotional offers that we are testing in the marketplace. So we think that the combination of those things plus our ability to migrate our customers from our linear channels to their digital channels really gives us reason to be fairly bullish in Latin America right now. And Christine. Okay. I'll start off on parks. So the issue or the question of capacity at parks is a bit of a complex one because it's driven by several different dynamics. First of all, we've got really strong domestic demand, as we've said, mitigated a little bit by a lagged return from the international markets. Now that in itself is expected because the booking timetable is so long on international trips. So we believe that will come up and enable us to get closer to where we would have been in the past. But in terms of sort of the self-management capacity, one of the last things to come back for us in a post-COVID world -- what we hope is a post-COVID world, is actually live entertainment because much of the live entertainment is close proximity. And we are self-regulating that. We are self-managing that because we don't want our guests to feel an excessive level of density. And the place that you get it is parades and firework shows and things like that. So I suspect that over time, we'll start to regain some of the capacity drop-off that where it's kind of self-imposing on ourselves. The other thing I should say is that, to a certain extent, because people spend such a long time in our parks and resorts, the food and beverage component is actually a pretty big one of those. And if there's -- we really haven't had too big of an issue in terms of retaining and attracting people into our parks -- to work into our parks at all. As a matter of fact, we had 85% of our cast members pretty much say, yes, immediately, when we ask them back. But at the same time, the 2 areas that have been difficult is hospitality, and right now, we've got 90% of our hotels at Walt Disney World open and we've got all of our hotels at Disneyland open, but also sort of cooks, I think kind of short order cooks. And so the capacity constraints, the self-imposed capacity constraints are really a function of our food and beverage sort of mitigation, if you will. But the second one is live entertainment, and we're working towards restoring both of those so that we can get up to something that would be more similar to what we've seen in the past in terms of the number of people we put into our parks. But I must tell you that our ability to increase our guest experience through a very -- a reservation system in a very carefully managed demand ticketing system has been something that we really like. And I think guaranteeing our guests that they have a great experience no matter when they come, whether it be the Christmas holiday or whether it be in the middle of the month of September, that's really important to us. And so we're going to self-manage as to optimize the guest experience. But at the same time, we know we firmly got some headroom, whether it's due to international or whether it's due to an expansion and reinstatement of things like live entertainment. Yes, yes. I think I got the gist of it. It is top of mind. It is absolutely top of mind because we realize that in the future, you can call it what you want. You want to call it metaverse, you want to call it the blending of the physical and digital experiences, which I think Disney should excel at for all the reasons that you said in your opening. We realize that it's going to be less of a passive type experience where you just have playback whether it's a sporting event or whether it's an entertainment offering and more of an interactive lean forward, actively engaged type experience. And this is a very top of mind thing for us because we are continuing over time to augment our skills and the types of people that we attract into The Walt Disney Company to reflect the aggressive and ambitious technology agenda that we have. You probably noticed that one of my 3 pillars is innovation and specifically technological innovation because we realize that this is going to be an important part of telling story in that third dimension that lean forward Interactive dimension. So it is absolutely top of mind."

It's great to have Hugh joining Disney at this important moment for our company. I'd also like to thank Kevin Lansberry, who stepped into the CFO role on an interim basis earlier this year and has provided strong leadership in the month since. Kevin is returning to his role as CFO of our Disney Experiences segment and you'll hear more from him in just a bit. Now let's turn to the quarter. Our results this quarter speak volumes about the underlying strength of our company and the remarkable amount of work we have accomplished this past year. Q4 adjusted earnings per share nearly tripled over the prior year. And all three of our businesses, Entertainment, Experiences, and Sports saw significant increases in fourth quarter operating income compared to Q4 of fiscal 2022. The thorough restructuring of our company has enabled tremendous efficiencies and we're on track to achieve roughly $7.5 billion in cost reductions, which is approximately $2 billion more than we targeted earlier this year. Our new structure also enabled us to greatly enhance our effectiveness, particularly in streaming, where we've created a more unified, cohesive and highly coordinated approach to marketing, pricing and programing. This has helped us to improve operating results of our combined streaming businesses by approximately $1.4 billion from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023. And we remain confident that we will achieve profitability in Q4 of fiscal 2024. And most importantly, our new structure has restored creativity to the center of our company and we certainly know from our now 100 year history that nothing is more important or critical to our success. Indeed, our strong creative accomplishments helped drive impressive growth in core Disney+ subs with nearly 7 million added in the quarter. This reflects the success of numerous popular titles to hit the platform, including Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, The Little Mermaid and Elemental, continuing the trend of our theatrical releases being some of the most watched content on Disney+. Key originals also performed incredibly well across all our platforms, including Ahsoka on Disney+, The Kardashians, which is now our most viewed unscripted Hulu original series ever and the spectacular Korean original series, Moving, which has become a breakout hit. As I reflect on our achievement this past year, I'm mindful of the fact that a lot of time and effort was spent on fixing, both contending with certain decisions made in the recent past and addressing the numerous challenges brought on by disruption and the pandemic. And while we still have work to do to continue improving results, our progress has allowed us to move beyond this period of fixing and begin building our businesses again. As we look forward, we are focusing on four key building opportunities that will be central to our success. And they are: achieving significant and sustained profitability in our streaming business; building ESPN into the pre-eminent digital sports platform; improving the output and economics of our film studios; and turbocharging growth in our Experiences business. We have already made considerable progress on these four opportunities and we will continue to move forward with a sense of purpose and urgency. I've articulated many of my thoughts about our strategic initiative. So today, I want to discuss in more detail these four building opportunities as we enter this next phase. First, is turning streaming into a profitable growth business and I'm pleased to say our recent performance solidifies that we're on that path. In the four years since we launched Disney+, which generated roughly 10 million sign ups in the first 24 hours alone, core Disney+ subscribers have now reached over 112 million as of this end of fiscal 2023, including the nearly 7 million we gained this quarter. What's more, our ad-supported Disney+ product grew by approximately 2 million subscriptions in Q4 to a total of 5.2 million. In fact, more than 50% of Q4 new US subscribers chose an ad-supported Disney+ product. And over the past six months, these [indiscernible] subs spent 34% more time watching the service. We have the best advertiser technology in the streaming business globally and we have just introduced new tools that will make this an even more attractive platform for advertisers, much as we've done with Hulu. And speaking of Hulu, we were pleased to announce last week that we will acquire the remaining stake in Hulu held by Comcast, which will further Disney streaming objectives. We remain on track to rollout a more unified one-app experience domestically, making extensive general entertainment content available to bundle subscribers via Disney+. That includes critical and audience favorite like Hulu's Only Murders in the Building. The Bear, Abbott Elementary, as well as titles from our extensive content library built over decade, including adult animation stand-up like Family Guy and long-running hit series like 911, which is moving to ABC for Season 7. We expect that Hulu and Disney+ will result in increased engagement, greater advertising opportunities, lower churn and reduced customer acquisition costs, thereby increasing our overall margins. We will launch a beta version for bundle subscribers in December, giving parents time to set-up profiles and parental controls that work best for their families ahead of the official launch in early spring 2024. Also, we have additional opportunities for improvement in our streaming business that will come from implementing stronger standards around account sharing, although given the timing of our planned rollout, we don't expect a meaningful impact until 2025. Now that we have realigned our pricing and marketing strategies focused aggressively on getting the technology right, merged our creative and distribution teams and restored creative excellence is our singular motivating priority with the content we create, we are bullish about the future of our streaming business. And as you consider the components in the future of that business, just imagine the opportunities that are further combined Disney+, Hulu and ESPN streaming experience could offer us as a company and our consumers. Another core building opportunity is taking ESPN, which is already the world's leading sports brand and turning it into the pre-eminent digital sports platform, allowing us to reach fans in compelling new ways and fully integrating key features into our primary ESPN offering. We're already moving quickly down this path, and we are exploring strategic partnerships to help advance our efforts through marketing, technology, distribution and additional content. As we continue to develop our streaming business, the continued strength of ESPN relative to the backdrop of notable linear industry declines, demonstrates the value of sports and the power of the ESPN brand. Overall, our domestic ESPN business grew in revenue and operating income in both fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2023. This fiscal year also saw the network deliver its best overall viewership in four years and its highest viewership in the key 18 to 49 demographic in the same time period. ESPN viewership was up in each of the four quarters as well, maintaining steady success throughout the entire year. Across ESPN networks, the company increased its already industry leading share of sports viewership in fiscal 2023 and we continue to see stability in ad sales, despite challenges facing the broader media industry. ESPN BET will launch next week through our agreement with Penn Entertainment and we're excited to bring sports fans this compelling new experience. Regarding our broader linear business. We continue to evaluate options for each of our linear networks with the goal of identifying the best strategic path for the company and maximizing shareholder value. However, our review of the business thus far has uncovered significant long-term cost opportunities which we are implementing, while continuing to deliver high quality content. Speaking of which, I'd like to acknowledge the world-class journalists and producers at ABC News. Over the past few months, many have risked their lives to keep our audiences informed during relentless news cycles and made ABC number one in network news for the 11th consecutive year. Next is the need to strengthen the creative output of our film studio, which generates value throughout the entire company. To achieve this, we are focusing heavily on the core brands and franchises that fuel all of our businesses, and reducing output overall to enable us to concentrate on fewer projects and improve quality, while continuing our effort around the creation of fresh and compelling original IP. I'm devoting considerably more of my time to this with the goal of improving returns, always seeking to exceed the level of creative excellence audiences expect from Disney. Meanwhile, we have four of the top 10 highest grossing films at the global box office this year, including Pixar's Elemental which has grossed nearly $0.5 billion worldwide in addition to being the most viewed film released this year on Disney+. We have more new releases still to come in calendar year 2023 including the Marvels from Marvel Studios, which will be released this Friday and Wish, our newest film from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which marks our company's 100th Anniversary and will be in theaters beginning November 22nd. We're also looking forward to our strong theatrical slate in 2024 with several films tied to popular franchises like Deadpool 3, featuring Wolverine, Kingdom of the Planet Apes and Inside Out 2. Additionally, Mufasa: The Lion King and sequels from our Toy Story, Frozen, Zootopia and Avatar franchises are all in the works. Finally, we have an opportunity to build Disney Experiences into an even bigger and more successful cash flow generation business. Parks and Experiences overall remains a growth story, and we are managing our portfolio exceptionally well. Even in the case of Walt Disney World, where we have a tough comparison to the prior year when you look at this year's numbers compared to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal 2019, we've seen growth in revenue and operating income of over 25% and 30%, respectively. Over the last five years, return on invested capital has nearly doubled in our domestic parks, and we have seen sizable increases over that same timeframe across the total Experiences portfolio as well. Not to mention the improved guest experience ratings we're now seeing at every one of our parks. As we announced in September, we plan to turbocharge growth in our Experiences business through strategic investments over the next decade. Given our wealth of IP, innovative technology, buildable land, unmatched creativity, and strong returns on invested capital, we're confident about the potential from our new investments. Looking at the company as a whole, today, we are focused on driving profitable growth and value creation as we move from a period of fixing to a new era of building. We have a strong balance sheet and we expect free cash flow to significantly improve in fiscal 2024, approaching pre-COVID levels. Disney's Experiences business with its expansive offerings around the world is a key differentiator and remains a powerful growth engine, expanding operating margins by nearly 300 basis points over the past five years. As we transition ESPN to a streaming future and more fully integrate general entertainment content into Disney+, we will have a DTC offering unlike any other in the industry. And Disney's leadership and workforce around the world are second to none. When you combine all of that with our unrivaled portfolio of valuable businesses, brands and assets, and the way we manage them together, Disney has a strong hand that differentiates us from others in the industry. Our results this quarter are a testament to the work we've done across the company this past year and I'm bullish about the opportunities we have to create lasting growth and shareholder value and to strengthen Disney's position as the world's leading entertainment company. And with that, I will turn things over to Kevin.\nKevin Lansberry: Thank you, Bob. I appreciate your kind words at the outset of the call. It's been an honor serving as Interim CFO these past few months. We are excited to welcome Hugh to the Walt Disney Company and I look forward to working with both of you on all of this ahead. Now to dive into this quarter's results. Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, increased versus the prior year to $0.82 in the fiscal fourth quarter, and $3.76 for the full fiscal year. This past year has been marked by both transformation and execution. And we are pleased with the momentum we are building and the results we've realized, including meeting our guide of high single-digit percentage growth in both revenue and operating income for fiscal 2023. Total company revenues for the year increased 7% and segment operating income grew by 8%, excluding the impact of accelerated depreciation from the Galactic Starcruiser. And free cash flow for the year increased substantially, totaling close to $5 billion, driven by the work we've been doing on the cost efficiency front and by improvement in our underlying financial results. A few weeks ago, we published our recast financials, aligned to our newly reorganized segment structure. Today, I'll be walking through the fourth quarter's financial results for each of our three segments: Entertainment; Sports; and Experiences. And I'll also provide some color for the year ahead. Starting off with Entertainment. Q4 operating income grew by over $800 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by improvement in our direct-to-consumer business. We continue to make headway on our path to profitability in streaming with fourth quarter operating losses at our Entertainment D2C services improving by nearly $1 billion versus the prior year or $85 million sequentially to $420 million. Note that our Entertainment direct-to-consumer results exclude ESPN+. Including ESPN+ our combined streaming businesses and an operating loss in the fourth quarter of $387 million, a year-over-year improvement of a little over $1 billion and a sequential improvement of $125 million. As Bob noted earlier, we added nearly 7 million Disney+ core subs over the past quarter, reflecting strong content performance and our global summer promotion. Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by $0.12, driven by pricing increases and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by the impact of the summer promotion. The Disney+ ad tier added approximately 2 million subs during the fourth quarter and ended the fiscal year with 5.2 million subscribers. We anticipate core Disney+ subscribers in fiscal Q1 will decline slightly versus Q4 due to the expected temporary uptick in churn from the recent US price increases, as well as from the end of the summer promotion. However, we expect to see sub growth rebound later in the fiscal year. Growth in Entertainment D2C advertising revenue of 4% in Q4 versus the prior year, partially offset linear ad declines. The growth reflects an increase at Disney+ while Hulu results declined due to lower political and technology category advertising. We continue to expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024. Although as we have mentioned in the past, we don't expect linear progress from quarter to quarter. While we expect Entertainment D2C operating losses in Q1 to be generally in line with Q4 due to higher sports rights costs at ESPN+ aligned with the start of the NHL season, we anticipate a modest sequential decline in Q1 for the combined streaming business. Whereas we have also said previously, we anticipate upward momentum later in the fiscal year to be driven by realizing the full impact of price increases, the launch of the ad tier internationally and subscriber growth. At linear networks, which now excludes our sports channels, fourth quarter operating income was flat to the prior year, reflecting lower advertising and affiliate revenues which were generally offset by a decrease in marketing and programming and production costs. Advertising revenue declines were driven by our domestic business, primarily at ABC and our own TV stations. Domestic entertainment affiliate revenue decreased by 4% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year due to a 6 point decline from fewer subscribers, and a 1.5 point adverse impact from the Charter blackout, partially offset by roughly 4 point impact from higher rates. As Bob mentioned, we remain focused on driving additional cost efficiencies in this business over the long term. Content sales, licensing and other, lower operating results versus the prior year were due to lower theatrical results, partially offset by higher home entertainment results. We currently expect that first quarter operating income will be roughly breakeven and comparable to the prior year. Moving to our Sports segment. Q4 operating income increased by 14% versus the prior year. Results were driven by our domestic ESPN business from lower programming and production costs. Growth in subscription revenue at ESPN+ due to both pricing and sub growth and lower marketing costs, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs reflect the absence of the Big 10. And domestic ESPN linear advertising revenue increased by 1% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, despite the absence of the Big 10, the charter blackout and a highly competitive marketplace. Domestic affiliate revenue decreased by a little less than 5% in Q4 versus the prior year as 5.5 points of growth from higher rates were offset by adverse impacts of approximately 7.5 points from fewer subscribers and two points from the charter blackout. As Bob referenced earlier, it's worth noting that ESPN's domestic business grew both full year revenue and operating income in each of the last two years. These results give us confidence in our belief that sports has the power to drive value for the company even in the face of challenging industry headwinds. Finally at Experiences. Fourth quarter operating results increased by over 30% versus the prior year quarter and 27% versus fiscal 2019. Operating margins at the segment were 22% in Q4, an increase of three percentage points versus the prior year. Our international operations continued their strong performance trend in the quarter with significant growth across all sites versus the prior year. Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club and Disneyland Resort also all saw strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and operating income, while Disney World operating results decreased, driven by the accelerated depreciation from the closure of the Galactic Starcruiser along with inflationary impacts and the continued comparison to the 50th Anniversary celebration in the prior year. Looking towards fiscal 2024, we anticipate robust annual operating income growth at Experiences to reflect continued strong performance at our International Parks and Disney Cruise Line. While domestic Parks and Experiences is expecting solid growth for the full year, that growth will be heavily back-end loaded due to continued challenging comparisons in the first half of the year from the 50th Anniversary at Walt Disney World in addition to wage inflation. We continue to be bullish on the long-term positioning of our Experiences business. As evidenced by our recent announcement, on significant investments we plan to make over the next 10 years to turbocharge growth in this area. We expect those investments to ramp up towards the back half of that 10-year period with more gradual increases in the first few years. As has been the case historically, CapEx for the parks are largely effectively self-funded, given the strong returns these investments generate over time and I would also note that a portion of the investments in our theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong is funded out of joint venture cash flows. Before we conclude and move to Q&A, there are a number of additional items I'd like to share for context on the year ahead. First on capital expenditures, fiscal 2023 CapEx totaled approximately $5 billion, roughly comparable to the prior year and in line with our most recent guidance. And we expect CapEx in fiscal 2024 to total $6 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion versus fiscal 2023, driven by higher spend at Experiences. CapEx at Experiences in fiscal 2024 will look more comparable to fiscal 2019 levels and includes spend at our Cruise business ahead of the launch of three new ships in fiscal 2025 and 2026. Our enterprise-wide content spend in fiscal 2023 was $27 billion, in line with our guidance and about $3 billion below the prior year as we significantly reduced our spend on entertainment content. As a result of our continued work to be more efficient in our content spend, in addition to impacts from the strikes and the timing of sports payments, we expect total content spend in fiscal 2024 to be approximately $25 billion, which is a decrease of $2 billion versus 2023. Note that sports rights now account for over 40% of our enterprise-wide content spend. Our annualized entertainment cash content spend reduction target is now $4.5 billion, excluding strike impacts and sports rights versus $3 billion previously. We expect this to be realized on a cash basis in fiscal 2024, although it will take a few years for the bulk of these savings to be reflected in the P&L due to the timing of amortization. On the topic of cost-savings and streamlining our operations, we have eliminated over 8,000 roles, and while we are not currently planning to make further large-scale reductions to our workforce, we are taking significant concrete steps to continue addressing the cost basis of the overall company. We have increased our annualized efficiency target for total company SG&A and other operating expenses to $3 billion versus $2.5 billion previously, excluding the strike impacts. Approximately $2 billion of these efficiencies were achieved in fiscal 2023. Naturally, we also saw inflation and volume-related cost increases throughout the year, including higher content amortization and costs related to expanded operations at International Parks and Cruise, which were impacted by closures and limited operating capacity in the prior year. The remainder of these savings are expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2024. Our expense base in fiscal 2024 is expected to only increase slightly versus the prior year as these efficiencies and strike savings will mostly offset the year's planned volume-related growth and inflation. Adding the new $4.5 billion cash content spend reduction target to the $3 billion expense target brings our total annualized target to $7.5 billion as Bob announced earlier. All of these factors, in addition to continued growth and improvement across our underlying businesses are expected to come together over the coming fiscal year to result in free-cash flow generation of roughly $8 billion, a significant year-over-year increase and approaching levels we last achieved pre-pandemic. This continued robust free-cash flow growth alongside our strong balance sheet will position us well to address our investment and shareholder returns goals for the year and going-forward. To that end, we will be recommending to the Board that they declared dividend by the end of this calendar year. While this will be just the starting point, we do see ample opportunity to continue to increase shareholder returns in the future as our earnings and free-cash flow grow in the form of increased dividends or share buybacks, and we look-forward to sharing more as we move ahead. And with that, I will turn the call-back to Alexia for Q&A.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Kevin. As we transition to Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many analysts as possible today. And with that operator, we're ready for the first questions.\nOperator: The first question will come from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. You may now go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Hey, Bob, I have two quick one\u2019s for you. This is your first earnings call post the Charter-Disney Agreement. So stepping back, what are the most important impacts to Disney after that agreement? And then how would you imagine company differently now that that is kind of the template going forward for new deals? And secondly, on film studio, your first said you had the most amazing content cycle on film we've ever seen. So I wonder, what do you think is ailing the film slate this time around and what are your priorities to fixing this as you lay out one of your top three priorities? But what are you doing in particular to fix the film slate going forward? Thanks.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Michael. Regarding Charter, first of all, as we said when we did the deal, we think it's a great deal for us. Also I think it's a great deal for Charter. It doesn't really change things much in terms of our strategy, because when you look at the deal, it actually ended up reflecting exactly what our strategic priorities are, that is streaming and the distribution agreement for Disney+ as part of the overall Charter deal does just that. So it leans into our streaming priorities, and that strategy doesn't change things much. Having the opportunity to consolidate a bit on the channel side is, I think, a good thing at this point. In terms of the studio, nice of you to mention just our great run. First of all, let's put things in perspective. Recently, we did have four really strong titles and four of the top 10 in the past year, led by Avatar, of course. But there were other successes, too. That said, as I've looked at our overall output, meaning, the studio, it's clear that the pandemic created a lot of challenges creatively for everybody, including for us. In addition, at the time the pandemic hit, we were leaning into a huge increase in how much we were making. And I've always felt that quantity can be actually a negative when it comes to quality. And I think that's exactly what happened. We lost some focus. And so, working with the talented team at the studio, we're looking to and working to consolidate, meaning, make less, focus more on quality. We're all rolling up our sleeves, including myself to do just that. We have obviously great assets, great stories to tell from the assets that we either have or that we purchased. And I feel really optimistic about the slate going forward, which is going to be a balance between some really strong sequels to some very, very popular titles, as well as some good original content, starting with Wish, which comes out Thanksgiving weekend. So I feel good about the direction we're headed, but I'm mindful of the fact that our performance from a quality perspective wasn't really up to the standards that we set for ourselves.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. You may now go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you. So first on DTC, I mean, pricing is about to step up. You announced the cost-cutting program. Some of which might be at DTC or Hulu. And Bob, I think for a couple of quarters you've just been talking about how confident you are in streaming profitability. So I'm not asking for guidance, but is there any way for us to just frame what DTC can look like beyond breakeven, since that's really the biggest driver of earnings growth and value creation? And then on the ESPN side, just as we think about that, preeminent sports platform that you're looking to build, so many folks have already voted with their feet to be outside of the bundle. How do you think about putting something into the market more quickly, maybe at a high price point that doesn't disrupt the bundle, just to see if the cord cutters or cord nevers have some demand? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: I'll take the second part first. Our plan when we bring ESPN direct-to-consumer, which is inevitable, which is going to happen, and we're planning for it, is to have what I'll call a soft landing, which is continue to make it available as part of the bundle for those people that want to remain in the bundle or people who feel that the bundle still has value to them, and at the same time to make it available on a true [indiscernible] basis in DTC form. So it is our hope that it will serve basically the consumer in two ways, in the traditional way and in a new way. And we'll obviously see in terms of where we end up the blend of basically consumers that stay in the bundle and those that leave. We're not concerned about it. And actually, as we model basically ESPN into the future, we see that in some cases it will continue to be sold as part of the bundle. And the first -- to the first question, the trajectory of DTC, we're not going to get specific and we're not giving any guidance beyond our guidance about becoming profitable at the end of 2024. But the building blocks are in place to turn this into a real growth business for us. And the recent announcement about purchasing the remaining stake in Hulu is just one of those building blocks. On the pricing side, we did take Disney+ prices up for the premium service, the non-advertiser supported by about 27%. It's still really early to tell, but we had taken those prices up significantly a year earlier and churn was de minimis. So we felt we have the room, particularly as we improve quality on the Disney+ service, where overall our strategy regarding pricing is more sophisticated, more coordinated across the world than it had been before. And as we look at growing that business, a smarter approach to pricing is one, bundling is another. I'm going to come back to the bundle between Disney+ and Hulu and then the opportunity to bundle ESPN. Clearly, we've got technology improvements in the works, whether it comes to account sharing, or whether it comes to basically lowering customer acquisition costs and churn, and lowering marketing expenses and growing margins. That's part of it. Advertising is a strong component of that. We did not take pricing up for Disney+ advertiser-supported services and the delta between the advertiser-supported and the premium services wider, because we like the ARPU that we get basically from both sides. So, we feel really good about the potential of this business. And look, if you think about the portfolio of streaming assets that we will have, Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN, that's a very, very strong hand. In December, we launched a beta version of Hulu and Disney+ combined. We feel really good about that. I saw some -- basically some demos of that just yesterday as a matter of fact. We are basically putting it in beta so that we can prepare parents largely to basically implement parental controls, because you'll be able to access Hulu programming on the same app. And then in late March we'll launch it basically in full form. And I think we have opportunities in terms of upsell capabilities, in terms of increasing engagement. We found that where we bundle, we lower churn. And again, these are steps that are all taken to ultimately turn this into a great business. Lastly, in terms of cost reductions, we created basically a one world approach to streaming. We had multiple organizations before. We now have one run globally by Dana Walden and Alan Bergman. They have created an entirely new senior management team across the globe to manage these assets. We're doing so much more cohesively, including, by the way, balancing spending in market, local spending and what I'll call global spending. One thing that we have recently really come to appreciate is the performance of our big title films, the so-called Pay 1 window films on the service. Elemental is one, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was another, Little Mermaid is third. The numbers are huge. That's a differentiator for us certainly when it comes to competing with Netflix, for instance, which is the gold standard. But by leaning more into some of those films and while we improve the quality of them, gives us the ability to dial back a bit on some of the spending and investment in series. And that blend of spending between films and series, we believe, gives an opportunity to increase our margins and grow the business.\nAlexia Quadrani: All right. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to come back to the free cash flow commentary because that's pretty interesting and new. And also ask you, Bob, about your US sports business and ESPN. So on cash flow, $8 billion of free cash flow, $6 billion of CapEx, getting the $14 billion of cash from operations. You haven't done a number like that, I think, since 2018. So I'm just trying to understand if you think you can sustain and grow your company at that level of cash content spent. I think Kevin said 2025, because that certainly allows you to really grow free cash flow from a base that's already higher than people were expecting in 2024. Hopefully, that made sense. And then on the sports side, Bob, people think about ESPN as a network facing cord cutting, et cetera. You clearly have a vision there that you think can grow over time. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about growing the sports business? Do you think you can, between linear and digital and other ancillary services, sort of grow your sports business over time? Because that would be another area where you'd certainly outperform expectations. Thanks so much.\nRobert Iger: I'll take the question about ESPN first. Interesting, I just saw statistics. ESPN is the number one brand on TikTok. Not the number one sports brand, not the number one media brand, the number one brand with about 44 million followers, which is an incredible statistic. ESPN is a very popular, high demand -- high in demand product in the United States, and unique, we believe, and we feel leaning into it is the smart thing to do because of its unique quality, how popular it is and how profitable it has been. We believe we have an opportunity there as we bring it in the direct-to-consumer direction. To strengthen our hand when we do that by partnering with either tech companies that can provide us with marketing technology support, customer acquisition help, or sports leagues that can provide us with more content. It's that simple. We're quite -- we are actually quite bullish about it. And frankly, if we were to just sit back and leave ESPN alone, kind of as part of the linear bundle, we know ultimately where that would bring us. It certainly wouldn't bring us in a growth direction because of the -- basically the continued decrease in multichannel subscribers. So this is a way to really buck that trend, continue to allow it to be part of the multichannel bundle, but also make it available on an [indiscernible] basis, basically taking a very popular product, in fact, and make it available and possibly strengthening it by doing what I described earlier. It's that simple. And we think about the building blocks of the company, which right now we believe there are four. One of them obviously is streaming overall. Another one we've talked about, which is Parks and Resorts and turbocharging that growth. The third I talked about earlier, which is returning the studio to basically the level of success that we became used to before the pandemic. And the fourth is turning ESPN into a preeminent digital sports platform. Kevin, you take the cash flow.\nKevin Lansberry: Yeah. With -- Ben, with respect to cash flow, we do feel good about where we are ending up in 2024 from a content spend perspective. And when you take a look at how we're getting to that year-over-year, lower content spend is clearly part of it. But continued growth and improvement of our underlying business is also a huge component of that, as is the annualized efficiency targets that we have all implemented. So those things are driving a significant amount of year-over-year improvement in our cash flow.\nAlexia Quadrani: All right. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. You may now go head.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Yes, thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Bob, I was wondering if you could give us your sort of holistic view on advertising and what's going on. I mean, we know money is going into like retail, media networks and things like that, but how much can you as a company make up on AVOD versus what's going on with linear? And maybe you can give us your view on what is going on with linear for you. And then on India, it\u2019s been notably challenging market consistent money loser. Can you talk about how -- your view of kind of ultimately where that winds up? Do you own it? Do you JV it? Do you exit the market?\nRobert Iger: Jessica, first of all, in India, our linear business actually does quite well. It's making money. But we know that other parts of that business are challenged for us and for others, and we are looking, I'll call it expansively. I know I've said this before. It always gets me in trouble. But we're considering our options there. We have an opportunity to strengthen our hand. It is, I think, now that maybe the most populous country in the world, or maybe just still second to China and about to pass them. We'd like to stay in that market. And -- but we also are looking to see whether we can strengthen our hand, obviously, improve the bottom line. In terms of advertising, we are actually finding that linear is a little bit stronger than we had expected it would be. It's not back as much as we would like. It's still challenged, but it's not as bad as it had been. So we've seen some slight improvement. Actually, the tech sector is still somewhat weak. But in general, overall, advertising has improved. We're finding, obviously, great demand for addressable advertising. I noted on an interview I did earlier that we've now put tools in place, or we're using tools on Disney+ to provide advertisers with better targeting. They're starting to work. And in general, sports has been very, very strong. So as we look at the advertising marketplace right now, while it's not as strong as we would like it to be, it's certainly not as bad as some people think it is. And it's working for us. On AVOD, look, it's very, very clear that the tools that the new platforms provide to advertisers are exactly what the advertisers are looking for. Those platforms are an advertiser's dream. And we know that the more data, the more detail, the more context, the more targeting we can provide, the better off we'll be. Hulu had an extremely robust advertising engine. We actually -- we've got one of the best in the business, if not the best. And so, actually, that combination of Hulu and Disney+ with some of the tools that we put in place, is going to give us the ability to have a blended CPM, grow engagement, grow advertising. So we're quite bullish about our position, media-wise in an advertising marketplace.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. You may now go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks. Maybe first, a follow up to Ben's question. Is there an opportunity for ESPN to add local sports rights, given what's happening to the RSN model, or potentially add sports rights to be distributed outside the US? That's the first question. And then second question is, Warner Brothers basically made some news recently by licensing some of their -- what would be considered some of their tentpole content, their DC Universe to Netflix. Is that something you think that Disney can do or can lean into, more -- at least more of that -- so than you're doing now without diluting the Disney brand or the Disney+ growth prospects? Thanks.\nRobert Iger: Good questions, John. Thank you. We've actually been licensing content to Netflix and are going to continue to. We're actually in discussion with them now about some opportunities, but I wouldn't expect that we will license our core brands to them. Those are real, obviously, competitive advantages for us and differentiators, Disney Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, for instance, all doing very, very well on our platform, and I don't see why, just basically to chase bucks we should do that when they are really, really important building blocks to the current and future of our streaming business. Regarding local sports, the technology that we will have for ESPN DTC will give us the ability to provide local sports in a pretty robust way, basically what the RSNs are doing. But we're not really aiming to do so by taking on significant risk. So if we can find the right kind of business arrangements and partnerships, I think we'll look very seriously at providing local sports as part of that platform. But again, not if it results in us taking on too much risk.\nAlexia Quadrani: All right. Thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question Phil Cusick with J. P. Morgan. You may now go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi, guys. Thank you. Bob. first follow up on ESPN, clearly a big priority. Can you give us some update on types of potential ESPN partners and what the hurdles might be to get those partnerships announced? And then second, maybe if you could dig into the recent trends of Parks. There's been some noise on pricing, but what have you seen from consumer demand, both in Orlando and around the country? And how do you think that Walt Disney World is doing versus the overall Orlando market? Thanks very much. A - Robert Iger The first question.\nAlexia Quadrani: First question was on the conversation [Multiple Speakers] A - Robert Iger Oh, thank you. Sorry. Sorry, Phil, I was kind -- I was listening to your second question. I forgot your first one. Senior moment. What basically we've been saying and what we've been exploring is that, as we prepare to take ESPN in the direct-to-consumer direction, we believe that we have opportunities to strengthen our hand with entities that either provide us with technology, marketing support, for instance, or companies or entities, I should say, that can provide us with more content. We feel we have an excellent hand, by the way, and could do it without that. But why not explore strengthening our hand? And so, since I noted that we were interested in this back in July, we've engaged with a number of different entities. I can say that there's significant interest out there. There are obviously complexities to it, but not complexities that were -- not hurdles that are so high that we can't jump over them. And we're going to continue to explore it. And I would imagine we'll have more to say about this in the coming months. But I don't want to say much more right now. Except again, there's serious interest out there, and I think there's a path or path to deals, but we're working through them. And obviously, as soon as they're completed, we'll let everybody know. You want to take the consumer demand question?\nKevin Lansberry: Yep. So with respect to the Parks, and I think we've talked about it in our prepared remarks with respect to Walt Disney World, and just we're lapping the 50th there. So we're going to continue to have a little bit of that lapping effect that will continue for a little bit as we go through Q1. But as I look out at the other domestic businesses, especially Disneyland continues to look exceptionally strong, as does Disney Cruise Line. So bookings at all of those continue to be very, very strong going forward. So domestically, we feel good and internationally we feel pretty good. So we're not really seeing anything in terms of an economic hangover.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Bob.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay, thanks for the question and.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Iger",
            "content": "Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, this week we announced that Hugh Johnston will be joining the Walt Disney Company as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer after 34 years with PepsiCo. It's great to have Hugh joining Disney at this important moment for our company. I'd also like to thank Kevin Lansberry, who stepped into the CFO role on an interim basis earlier this year and has provided strong leadership in the month since. Kevin is returning to his role as CFO of our Disney Experiences segment and you'll hear more from him in just a bit. Now let's turn to the quarter. Our results this quarter speak volumes about the underlying strength of our company and the remarkable amount of work we have accomplished this past year. Q4 adjusted earnings per share nearly tripled over the prior year. And all three of our businesses, Entertainment, Experiences, and Sports saw significant increases in fourth quarter operating income compared to Q4 of fiscal 2022. The thorough restructuring of our company has enabled tremendous efficiencies and we're on track to achieve roughly $7.5 billion in cost reductions, which is approximately $2 billion more than we targeted earlier this year. Our new structure also enabled us to greatly enhance our effectiveness, particularly in streaming, where we've created a more unified, cohesive and highly coordinated approach to marketing, pricing and programing. This has helped us to improve operating results of our combined streaming businesses by approximately $1.4 billion from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023. And we remain confident that we will achieve profitability in Q4 of fiscal 2024. And most importantly, our new structure has restored creativity to the center of our company and we certainly know from our now 100 year history that nothing is more important or critical to our success. Indeed, our strong creative accomplishments helped drive impressive growth in core Disney+ subs with nearly 7 million added in the quarter. This reflects the success of numerous popular titles to hit the platform, including Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, The Little Mermaid and Elemental, continuing the trend of our theatrical releases being some of the most watched content on Disney+. Key originals also performed incredibly well across all our platforms, including Ahsoka on Disney+, The Kardashians, which is now our most viewed unscripted Hulu original series ever and the spectacular Korean original series, Moving, which has become a breakout hit. As I reflect on our achievement this past year, I'm mindful of the fact that a lot of time and effort was spent on fixing, both contending with certain decisions made in the recent past and addressing the numerous challenges brought on by disruption and the pandemic. And while we still have work to do to continue improving results, our progress has allowed us to move beyond this period of fixing and begin building our businesses again. As we look forward, we are focusing on four key building opportunities that will be central to our success. And they are: achieving significant and sustained profitability in our streaming business; building ESPN into the pre-eminent digital sports platform; improving the output and economics of our film studios; and turbocharging growth in our Experiences business. We have already made considerable progress on these four opportunities and we will continue to move forward with a sense of purpose and urgency. I've articulated many of my thoughts about our strategic initiative. So today, I want to discuss in more detail these four building opportunities as we enter this next phase. First, is turning streaming into a profitable growth business and I'm pleased to say our recent performance solidifies that we're on that path. In the four years since we launched Disney+, which generated roughly 10 million sign ups in the first 24 hours alone, core Disney+ subscribers have now reached over 112 million as of this end of fiscal 2023, including the nearly 7 million we gained this quarter. What's more, our ad-supported Disney+ product grew by approximately 2 million subscriptions in Q4 to a total of 5.2 million. In fact, more than 50% of Q4 new US subscribers chose an ad-supported Disney+ product. And over the past six months, these [indiscernible] subs spent 34% more time watching the service. We have the best advertiser technology in the streaming business globally and we have just introduced new tools that will make this an even more attractive platform for advertisers, much as we've done with Hulu. And speaking of Hulu, we were pleased to announce last week that we will acquire the remaining stake in Hulu held by Comcast, which will further Disney streaming objectives. We remain on track to rollout a more unified one-app experience domestically, making extensive general entertainment content available to bundle subscribers via Disney+. That includes critical and audience favorite like Hulu's Only Murders in the Building. The Bear, Abbott Elementary, as well as titles from our extensive content library built over decade, including adult animation stand-up like Family Guy and long-running hit series like 911, which is moving to ABC for Season 7. We expect that Hulu and Disney+ will result in increased engagement, greater advertising opportunities, lower churn and reduced customer acquisition costs, thereby increasing our overall margins. We will launch a beta version for bundle subscribers in December, giving parents time to set-up profiles and parental controls that work best for their families ahead of the official launch in early spring 2024. Also, we have additional opportunities for improvement in our streaming business that will come from implementing stronger standards around account sharing, although given the timing of our planned rollout, we don't expect a meaningful impact until 2025. Now that we have realigned our pricing and marketing strategies focused aggressively on getting the technology right, merged our creative and distribution teams and restored creative excellence is our singular motivating priority with the content we create, we are bullish about the future of our streaming business. And as you consider the components in the future of that business, just imagine the opportunities that are further combined Disney+, Hulu and ESPN streaming experience could offer us as a company and our consumers. Another core building opportunity is taking ESPN, which is already the world's leading sports brand and turning it into the pre-eminent digital sports platform, allowing us to reach fans in compelling new ways and fully integrating key features into our primary ESPN offering. We're already moving quickly down this path, and we are exploring strategic partnerships to help advance our efforts through marketing, technology, distribution and additional content. As we continue to develop our streaming business, the continued strength of ESPN relative to the backdrop of notable linear industry declines, demonstrates the value of sports and the power of the ESPN brand. Overall, our domestic ESPN business grew in revenue and operating income in both fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2023. This fiscal year also saw the network deliver its best overall viewership in four years and its highest viewership in the key 18 to 49 demographic in the same time period. ESPN viewership was up in each of the four quarters as well, maintaining steady success throughout the entire year. Across ESPN networks, the company increased its already industry leading share of sports viewership in fiscal 2023 and we continue to see stability in ad sales, despite challenges facing the broader media industry. ESPN BET will launch next week through our agreement with Penn Entertainment and we're excited to bring sports fans this compelling new experience. Regarding our broader linear business. We continue to evaluate options for each of our linear networks with the goal of identifying the best strategic path for the company and maximizing shareholder value. However, our review of the business thus far has uncovered significant long-term cost opportunities which we are implementing, while continuing to deliver high quality content. Speaking of which, I'd like to acknowledge the world-class journalists and producers at ABC News. Over the past few months, many have risked their lives to keep our audiences informed during relentless news cycles and made ABC number one in network news for the 11th consecutive year. Next is the need to strengthen the creative output of our film studio, which generates value throughout the entire company. To achieve this, we are focusing heavily on the core brands and franchises that fuel all of our businesses, and reducing output overall to enable us to concentrate on fewer projects and improve quality, while continuing our effort around the creation of fresh and compelling original IP. I'm devoting considerably more of my time to this with the goal of improving returns, always seeking to exceed the level of creative excellence audiences expect from Disney. Meanwhile, we have four of the top 10 highest grossing films at the global box office this year, including Pixar's Elemental which has grossed nearly $0.5 billion worldwide in addition to being the most viewed film released this year on Disney+. We have more new releases still to come in calendar year 2023 including the Marvels from Marvel Studios, which will be released this Friday and Wish, our newest film from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which marks our company's 100th Anniversary and will be in theaters beginning November 22nd. We're also looking forward to our strong theatrical slate in 2024 with several films tied to popular franchises like Deadpool 3, featuring Wolverine, Kingdom of the Planet Apes and Inside Out 2. Additionally, Mufasa: The Lion King and sequels from our Toy Story, Frozen, Zootopia and Avatar franchises are all in the works. Finally, we have an opportunity to build Disney Experiences into an even bigger and more successful cash flow generation business. Parks and Experiences overall remains a growth story, and we are managing our portfolio exceptionally well. Even in the case of Walt Disney World, where we have a tough comparison to the prior year when you look at this year's numbers compared to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal 2019, we've seen growth in revenue and operating income of over 25% and 30%, respectively. Over the last five years, return on invested capital has nearly doubled in our domestic parks, and we have seen sizable increases over that same timeframe across the total Experiences portfolio as well. Not to mention the improved guest experience ratings we're now seeing at every one of our parks. As we announced in September, we plan to turbocharge growth in our Experiences business through strategic investments over the next decade. Given our wealth of IP, innovative technology, buildable land, unmatched creativity, and strong returns on invested capital, we're confident about the potential from our new investments. Looking at the company as a whole, today, we are focused on driving profitable growth and value creation as we move from a period of fixing to a new era of building. We have a strong balance sheet and we expect free cash flow to significantly improve in fiscal 2024, approaching pre-COVID levels. Disney's Experiences business with its expansive offerings around the world is a key differentiator and remains a powerful growth engine, expanding operating margins by nearly 300 basis points over the past five years. As we transition ESPN to a streaming future and more fully integrate general entertainment content into Disney+, we will have a DTC offering unlike any other in the industry. And Disney's leadership and workforce around the world are second to none. When you combine all of that with our unrivaled portfolio of valuable businesses, brands and assets, and the way we manage them together, Disney has a strong hand that differentiates us from others in the industry. Our results this quarter are a testament to the work we've done across the company this past year and I'm bullish about the opportunities we have to create lasting growth and shareholder value and to strengthen Disney's position as the world's leading entertainment company. And with that, I will turn things over to Kevin. Thanks, Michael. Regarding Charter, first of all, as we said when we did the deal, we think it's a great deal for us. Also I think it's a great deal for Charter. It doesn't really change things much in terms of our strategy, because when you look at the deal, it actually ended up reflecting exactly what our strategic priorities are, that is streaming and the distribution agreement for Disney+ as part of the overall Charter deal does just that. So it leans into our streaming priorities, and that strategy doesn't change things much. Having the opportunity to consolidate a bit on the channel side is, I think, a good thing at this point. In terms of the studio, nice of you to mention just our great run. First of all, let's put things in perspective. Recently, we did have four really strong titles and four of the top 10 in the past year, led by Avatar, of course. But there were other successes, too. That said, as I've looked at our overall output, meaning, the studio, it's clear that the pandemic created a lot of challenges creatively for everybody, including for us. In addition, at the time the pandemic hit, we were leaning into a huge increase in how much we were making. And I've always felt that quantity can be actually a negative when it comes to quality. And I think that's exactly what happened. We lost some focus. And so, working with the talented team at the studio, we're looking to and working to consolidate, meaning, make less, focus more on quality. We're all rolling up our sleeves, including myself to do just that. We have obviously great assets, great stories to tell from the assets that we either have or that we purchased. And I feel really optimistic about the slate going forward, which is going to be a balance between some really strong sequels to some very, very popular titles, as well as some good original content, starting with Wish, which comes out Thanksgiving weekend. So I feel good about the direction we're headed, but I'm mindful of the fact that our performance from a quality perspective wasn't really up to the standards that we set for ourselves. I'll take the second part first. Our plan when we bring ESPN direct-to-consumer, which is inevitable, which is going to happen, and we're planning for it, is to have what I'll call a soft landing, which is continue to make it available as part of the bundle for those people that want to remain in the bundle or people who feel that the bundle still has value to them, and at the same time to make it available on a true [indiscernible] basis in DTC form. So it is our hope that it will serve basically the consumer in two ways, in the traditional way and in a new way. And we'll obviously see in terms of where we end up the blend of basically consumers that stay in the bundle and those that leave. We're not concerned about it. And actually, as we model basically ESPN into the future, we see that in some cases it will continue to be sold as part of the bundle. And the first -- to the first question, the trajectory of DTC, we're not going to get specific and we're not giving any guidance beyond our guidance about becoming profitable at the end of 2024. But the building blocks are in place to turn this into a real growth business for us. And the recent announcement about purchasing the remaining stake in Hulu is just one of those building blocks. On the pricing side, we did take Disney+ prices up for the premium service, the non-advertiser supported by about 27%. It's still really early to tell, but we had taken those prices up significantly a year earlier and churn was de minimis. So we felt we have the room, particularly as we improve quality on the Disney+ service, where overall our strategy regarding pricing is more sophisticated, more coordinated across the world than it had been before. And as we look at growing that business, a smarter approach to pricing is one, bundling is another. I'm going to come back to the bundle between Disney+ and Hulu and then the opportunity to bundle ESPN. Clearly, we've got technology improvements in the works, whether it comes to account sharing, or whether it comes to basically lowering customer acquisition costs and churn, and lowering marketing expenses and growing margins. That's part of it. Advertising is a strong component of that. We did not take pricing up for Disney+ advertiser-supported services and the delta between the advertiser-supported and the premium services wider, because we like the ARPU that we get basically from both sides. So, we feel really good about the potential of this business. And look, if you think about the portfolio of streaming assets that we will have, Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN, that's a very, very strong hand. In December, we launched a beta version of Hulu and Disney+ combined. We feel really good about that. I saw some -- basically some demos of that just yesterday as a matter of fact. We are basically putting it in beta so that we can prepare parents largely to basically implement parental controls, because you'll be able to access Hulu programming on the same app. And then in late March we'll launch it basically in full form. And I think we have opportunities in terms of upsell capabilities, in terms of increasing engagement. We found that where we bundle, we lower churn. And again, these are steps that are all taken to ultimately turn this into a great business. Lastly, in terms of cost reductions, we created basically a one world approach to streaming. We had multiple organizations before. We now have one run globally by Dana Walden and Alan Bergman. They have created an entirely new senior management team across the globe to manage these assets. We're doing so much more cohesively, including, by the way, balancing spending in market, local spending and what I'll call global spending. One thing that we have recently really come to appreciate is the performance of our big title films, the so-called Pay 1 window films on the service. Elemental is one, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was another, Little Mermaid is third. The numbers are huge. That's a differentiator for us certainly when it comes to competing with Netflix, for instance, which is the gold standard. But by leaning more into some of those films and while we improve the quality of them, gives us the ability to dial back a bit on some of the spending and investment in series. And that blend of spending between films and series, we believe, gives an opportunity to increase our margins and grow the business. I'll take the question about ESPN first. Interesting, I just saw statistics. ESPN is the number one brand on TikTok. Not the number one sports brand, not the number one media brand, the number one brand with about 44 million followers, which is an incredible statistic. ESPN is a very popular, high demand -- high in demand product in the United States, and unique, we believe, and we feel leaning into it is the smart thing to do because of its unique quality, how popular it is and how profitable it has been. We believe we have an opportunity there as we bring it in the direct-to-consumer direction. To strengthen our hand when we do that by partnering with either tech companies that can provide us with marketing technology support, customer acquisition help, or sports leagues that can provide us with more content. It's that simple. We're quite -- we are actually quite bullish about it. And frankly, if we were to just sit back and leave ESPN alone, kind of as part of the linear bundle, we know ultimately where that would bring us. It certainly wouldn't bring us in a growth direction because of the -- basically the continued decrease in multichannel subscribers. So this is a way to really buck that trend, continue to allow it to be part of the multichannel bundle, but also make it available on an [indiscernible] basis, basically taking a very popular product, in fact, and make it available and possibly strengthening it by doing what I described earlier. It's that simple. And we think about the building blocks of the company, which right now we believe there are four. One of them obviously is streaming overall. Another one we've talked about, which is Parks and Resorts and turbocharging that growth. The third I talked about earlier, which is returning the studio to basically the level of success that we became used to before the pandemic. And the fourth is turning ESPN into a preeminent digital sports platform. Kevin, you take the cash flow. Jessica, first of all, in India, our linear business actually does quite well. It's making money. But we know that other parts of that business are challenged for us and for others, and we are looking, I'll call it expansively. I know I've said this before. It always gets me in trouble. But we're considering our options there. We have an opportunity to strengthen our hand. It is, I think, now that maybe the most populous country in the world, or maybe just still second to China and about to pass them. We'd like to stay in that market. And -- but we also are looking to see whether we can strengthen our hand, obviously, improve the bottom line. In terms of advertising, we are actually finding that linear is a little bit stronger than we had expected it would be. It's not back as much as we would like. It's still challenged, but it's not as bad as it had been. So we've seen some slight improvement. Actually, the tech sector is still somewhat weak. But in general, overall, advertising has improved. We're finding, obviously, great demand for addressable advertising. I noted on an interview I did earlier that we've now put tools in place, or we're using tools on Disney+ to provide advertisers with better targeting. They're starting to work. And in general, sports has been very, very strong. So as we look at the advertising marketplace right now, while it's not as strong as we would like it to be, it's certainly not as bad as some people think it is. And it's working for us. On AVOD, look, it's very, very clear that the tools that the new platforms provide to advertisers are exactly what the advertisers are looking for. Those platforms are an advertiser's dream. And we know that the more data, the more detail, the more context, the more targeting we can provide, the better off we'll be. Hulu had an extremely robust advertising engine. We actually -- we've got one of the best in the business, if not the best. And so, actually, that combination of Hulu and Disney+ with some of the tools that we put in place, is going to give us the ability to have a blended CPM, grow engagement, grow advertising. So we're quite bullish about our position, media-wise in an advertising marketplace. Good questions, John. Thank you. We've actually been licensing content to Netflix and are going to continue to. We're actually in discussion with them now about some opportunities, but I wouldn't expect that we will license our core brands to them. Those are real, obviously, competitive advantages for us and differentiators, Disney Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, for instance, all doing very, very well on our platform, and I don't see why, just basically to chase bucks we should do that when they are really, really important building blocks to the current and future of our streaming business. Regarding local sports, the technology that we will have for ESPN DTC will give us the ability to provide local sports in a pretty robust way, basically what the RSNs are doing. But we're not really aiming to do so by taking on significant risk. So if we can find the right kind of business arrangements and partnerships, I think we'll look very seriously at providing local sports as part of that platform. But again, not if it results in us taking on too much risk."

            "name": "Kevin Lansberry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. I appreciate your kind words at the outset of the call. It's been an honor serving as Interim CFO these past few months. We are excited to welcome Hugh to the Walt Disney Company and I look forward to working with both of you on all of this ahead. Now to dive into this quarter's results. Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, increased versus the prior year to $0.82 in the fiscal fourth quarter, and $3.76 for the full fiscal year. This past year has been marked by both transformation and execution. And we are pleased with the momentum we are building and the results we've realized, including meeting our guide of high single-digit percentage growth in both revenue and operating income for fiscal 2023. Total company revenues for the year increased 7% and segment operating income grew by 8%, excluding the impact of accelerated depreciation from the Galactic Starcruiser. And free cash flow for the year increased substantially, totaling close to $5 billion, driven by the work we've been doing on the cost efficiency front and by improvement in our underlying financial results. A few weeks ago, we published our recast financials, aligned to our newly reorganized segment structure. Today, I'll be walking through the fourth quarter's financial results for each of our three segments: Entertainment; Sports; and Experiences. And I'll also provide some color for the year ahead. Starting off with Entertainment. Q4 operating income grew by over $800 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by improvement in our direct-to-consumer business. We continue to make headway on our path to profitability in streaming with fourth quarter operating losses at our Entertainment D2C services improving by nearly $1 billion versus the prior year or $85 million sequentially to $420 million. Note that our Entertainment direct-to-consumer results exclude ESPN+. Including ESPN+ our combined streaming businesses and an operating loss in the fourth quarter of $387 million, a year-over-year improvement of a little over $1 billion and a sequential improvement of $125 million. As Bob noted earlier, we added nearly 7 million Disney+ core subs over the past quarter, reflecting strong content performance and our global summer promotion. Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by $0.12, driven by pricing increases and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by the impact of the summer promotion. The Disney+ ad tier added approximately 2 million subs during the fourth quarter and ended the fiscal year with 5.2 million subscribers. We anticipate core Disney+ subscribers in fiscal Q1 will decline slightly versus Q4 due to the expected temporary uptick in churn from the recent US price increases, as well as from the end of the summer promotion. However, we expect to see sub growth rebound later in the fiscal year. Growth in Entertainment D2C advertising revenue of 4% in Q4 versus the prior year, partially offset linear ad declines. The growth reflects an increase at Disney+ while Hulu results declined due to lower political and technology category advertising. We continue to expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024. Although as we have mentioned in the past, we don't expect linear progress from quarter to quarter. While we expect Entertainment D2C operating losses in Q1 to be generally in line with Q4 due to higher sports rights costs at ESPN+ aligned with the start of the NHL season, we anticipate a modest sequential decline in Q1 for the combined streaming business. Whereas we have also said previously, we anticipate upward momentum later in the fiscal year to be driven by realizing the full impact of price increases, the launch of the ad tier internationally and subscriber growth. At linear networks, which now excludes our sports channels, fourth quarter operating income was flat to the prior year, reflecting lower advertising and affiliate revenues which were generally offset by a decrease in marketing and programming and production costs. Advertising revenue declines were driven by our domestic business, primarily at ABC and our own TV stations. Domestic entertainment affiliate revenue decreased by 4% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year due to a 6 point decline from fewer subscribers, and a 1.5 point adverse impact from the Charter blackout, partially offset by roughly 4 point impact from higher rates. As Bob mentioned, we remain focused on driving additional cost efficiencies in this business over the long term. Content sales, licensing and other, lower operating results versus the prior year were due to lower theatrical results, partially offset by higher home entertainment results. We currently expect that first quarter operating income will be roughly breakeven and comparable to the prior year. Moving to our Sports segment. Q4 operating income increased by 14% versus the prior year. Results were driven by our domestic ESPN business from lower programming and production costs. Growth in subscription revenue at ESPN+ due to both pricing and sub growth and lower marketing costs, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs reflect the absence of the Big 10. And domestic ESPN linear advertising revenue increased by 1% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, despite the absence of the Big 10, the charter blackout and a highly competitive marketplace. Domestic affiliate revenue decreased by a little less than 5% in Q4 versus the prior year as 5.5 points of growth from higher rates were offset by adverse impacts of approximately 7.5 points from fewer subscribers and two points from the charter blackout. As Bob referenced earlier, it's worth noting that ESPN's domestic business grew both full year revenue and operating income in each of the last two years. These results give us confidence in our belief that sports has the power to drive value for the company even in the face of challenging industry headwinds. Finally at Experiences. Fourth quarter operating results increased by over 30% versus the prior year quarter and 27% versus fiscal 2019. Operating margins at the segment were 22% in Q4, an increase of three percentage points versus the prior year. Our international operations continued their strong performance trend in the quarter with significant growth across all sites versus the prior year. Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club and Disneyland Resort also all saw strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and operating income, while Disney World operating results decreased, driven by the accelerated depreciation from the closure of the Galactic Starcruiser along with inflationary impacts and the continued comparison to the 50th Anniversary celebration in the prior year. Looking towards fiscal 2024, we anticipate robust annual operating income growth at Experiences to reflect continued strong performance at our International Parks and Disney Cruise Line. While domestic Parks and Experiences is expecting solid growth for the full year, that growth will be heavily back-end loaded due to continued challenging comparisons in the first half of the year from the 50th Anniversary at Walt Disney World in addition to wage inflation. We continue to be bullish on the long-term positioning of our Experiences business. As evidenced by our recent announcement, on significant investments we plan to make over the next 10 years to turbocharge growth in this area. We expect those investments to ramp up towards the back half of that 10-year period with more gradual increases in the first few years. As has been the case historically, CapEx for the parks are largely effectively self-funded, given the strong returns these investments generate over time and I would also note that a portion of the investments in our theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong is funded out of joint venture cash flows. Before we conclude and move to Q&A, there are a number of additional items I'd like to share for context on the year ahead. First on capital expenditures, fiscal 2023 CapEx totaled approximately $5 billion, roughly comparable to the prior year and in line with our most recent guidance. And we expect CapEx in fiscal 2024 to total $6 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion versus fiscal 2023, driven by higher spend at Experiences. CapEx at Experiences in fiscal 2024 will look more comparable to fiscal 2019 levels and includes spend at our Cruise business ahead of the launch of three new ships in fiscal 2025 and 2026. Our enterprise-wide content spend in fiscal 2023 was $27 billion, in line with our guidance and about $3 billion below the prior year as we significantly reduced our spend on entertainment content. As a result of our continued work to be more efficient in our content spend, in addition to impacts from the strikes and the timing of sports payments, we expect total content spend in fiscal 2024 to be approximately $25 billion, which is a decrease of $2 billion versus 2023. Note that sports rights now account for over 40% of our enterprise-wide content spend. Our annualized entertainment cash content spend reduction target is now $4.5 billion, excluding strike impacts and sports rights versus $3 billion previously. We expect this to be realized on a cash basis in fiscal 2024, although it will take a few years for the bulk of these savings to be reflected in the P&L due to the timing of amortization. On the topic of cost-savings and streamlining our operations, we have eliminated over 8,000 roles, and while we are not currently planning to make further large-scale reductions to our workforce, we are taking significant concrete steps to continue addressing the cost basis of the overall company. We have increased our annualized efficiency target for total company SG&A and other operating expenses to $3 billion versus $2.5 billion previously, excluding the strike impacts. Approximately $2 billion of these efficiencies were achieved in fiscal 2023. Naturally, we also saw inflation and volume-related cost increases throughout the year, including higher content amortization and costs related to expanded operations at International Parks and Cruise, which were impacted by closures and limited operating capacity in the prior year. The remainder of these savings are expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2024. Our expense base in fiscal 2024 is expected to only increase slightly versus the prior year as these efficiencies and strike savings will mostly offset the year's planned volume-related growth and inflation. Adding the new $4.5 billion cash content spend reduction target to the $3 billion expense target brings our total annualized target to $7.5 billion as Bob announced earlier. All of these factors, in addition to continued growth and improvement across our underlying businesses are expected to come together over the coming fiscal year to result in free-cash flow generation of roughly $8 billion, a significant year-over-year increase and approaching levels we last achieved pre-pandemic. This continued robust free-cash flow growth alongside our strong balance sheet will position us well to address our investment and shareholder returns goals for the year and going-forward. To that end, we will be recommending to the Board that they declared dividend by the end of this calendar year. While this will be just the starting point, we do see ample opportunity to continue to increase shareholder returns in the future as our earnings and free-cash flow grow in the form of increased dividends or share buybacks, and we look-forward to sharing more as we move ahead. And with that, I will turn the call-back to Alexia for Q&A. Yeah. With -- Ben, with respect to cash flow, we do feel good about where we are ending up in 2024 from a content spend perspective. And when you take a look at how we're getting to that year-over-year, lower content spend is clearly part of it. But continued growth and improvement of our underlying business is also a huge component of that, as is the annualized efficiency targets that we have all implemented. So those things are driving a significant amount of year-over-year improvement in our cash flow. Yep. So with respect to the Parks, and I think we've talked about it in our prepared remarks with respect to Walt Disney World, and just we're lapping the 50th there. So we're going to continue to have a little bit of that lapping effect that will continue for a little bit as we go through Q1. But as I look out at the other domestic businesses, especially Disneyland continues to look exceptionally strong, as does Disney Cruise Line. So bookings at all of those continue to be very, very strong going forward. So domestically, we feel good and internationally we feel pretty good. So we're not really seeing anything in terms of an economic hangover."

[Operator Instructions] After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Alexia Quadrani, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be made available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Lansberry, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Kevin, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon. In the eight months since I returned, we've undertaken an unprecedented transformation at Disney and this quarter's earnings reflect some of what we have accomplished. First, the company was completely restructured, restoring creativity to the center of our business. We made important management changes and efficiency improvements to create a more cost-effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations. We aggressively reduced costs across the enterprise and we're on track to exceed our initial goal of $5.5 billion in savings. And perhaps most importantly, we've improved our DTC operating income by roughly $1 billion in just three quarters, as we continue to work toward achieving DTC profitability by the end of fiscal 2024. I'm pleased with how much we've gotten done in such a short period of time, but I also know we have a lot more to do. Before I turn the call over to Kevin Lansberry, our Interim CFO, I'd like to elaborate on the state of our company and the transformative work we are still undertaking. As I've said before, our progress will not always be linear. But despite near-term headwinds, I'm incredibly confident in Disney's long-term trajectory because of the work we've done, the team we have in place and because of Disney's core intellectual property foundation. Moving forward, I believe three businesses will drive the greatest growth and value creation over the next five years. They are our film studios, our parks business and streaming, all of which are inextricably linked to our brands and franchises. Looking to Disney Entertainment studios, we're focused on improving the quality of our films and on better economics, not just reducing the number of titles we release but also the cost per title. And we're maximizing the full impact of our titles by embracing the multiple distribution windows at our disposal, enabling consumers to access their content in multiple ways. For example, Avatar: The Way of Water, which is now the third highest grossing film of all time, is also on track to be the biggest ever electronic home video release for Disney domestically. Certain other titles will be sold in the download-to-own window as well. By focusing on big franchises and tentpole films, we're able to generate interest in our existing library. For example, we're seeing tremendous engagement on Disney+ with the previous Guardians of the Galaxy films, the original Avatar and the first four Indiana Jones movies. But the value of our Disney entertainment studios and the reason this will be a key growth business for us extends far beyond our library and new releases. What sets Disney apart are the numerous ways we're able to reach consumers with the stories and characters they love, including in our parks and resorts. We'll be opening new Frozen theme lands at Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris as well as the Zootopia theme land at Shanghai Disney Resort. And later down the road, we will be bringing an Avatar experience to Disneyland, reinforcing the unrivaled worldwide appeal of our brands and franchises. Our Parks and Experience segment overall has had an impressive streak and will continue to be a key growth engine for the company, even as we navigate the cycles that come with operating this business. Our Cruise Line in particular showed strong revenue and operating income growth in the third quarter. Current Q4 booked occupancy for our existing fleet of five ships is at 98% and we will be expanding our fleet by adding two more ships in fiscal '25 and another in fiscal '26, nearly doubling our worldwide capacity. In addition to our Cruise Line, strong segment results for the quarter were driven by solid performance at our international parks, and we also saw continued strength at Disneyland Resort. Our Asia parks have been doing exceptionally well, reinforcing a clear opportunity for continued growth. Both Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland have experienced stronger-than-expected recoveries from the pandemic. And in Q3, they both grew meaningfully in revenue, operating income and attendance. We saw softer performance at Walt Disney World from the prior year, coming off our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration. Also as post-COVID pent-up demand continues to level off in Florida, local tax data shows evidence of some softening in several major Florida tourism markets. And the strong dollar is expected to continue tamping down international visitation to the state. However, Walt Disney World is still performing well above pre-COVID levels, 21% higher in revenue and 29% higher in operating income compared to fiscal 2019, adjusting for Starcruiser accelerated depreciation. And following a number of recent changes we've implemented, we continue to see positive guest experience ratings in our theme parks, including Walt Disney World and positive indicators for guests looking to book future visits. This includes strong demand for our newly returned annual passes. We're making numerous investments globally to grow our parks business over the next five years, and I'm very optimistic about the future of this business over the long term. The third area that will drive growth and value creation for Disney is our direct-to-consumer business. When you consider our path to profitability in streaming, it's important to remember where we started and how we've adapted based on what we've learned. We overachieved with massive subscriber growth for Disney+ out of the gate and we leaned into a spending level to fuel subscriber growth, which had been the key measure of success for many. All of this happened while we were still determining the right strategies for pricing, marketing, content and specific international market investments. However, since my return, we've reset the whole business around economics designed to deliver significant, sustained profitability. We're prioritizing the strength of our brands and franchises. We're rationalizing the volume of content we make, what we spend and what markets we invest in. We're deploying the technology necessary to both improve the user experience as well as the economics of this business. We're harnessing windowing opportunities, perfecting our pricing and marketing strategies, maximizing our enormous advertising potential and we're making extensive Hulu content available to bundle subscribers via Disney+. As I announced last quarter, we're moving closer toward a more unified one-app experience domestically to pair high-quality general entertainment with content from our popular brands and franchises for our bundle subscribers. It's a formula for success that we have already proven in international markets with our Star offering on Disney+. We see a future where consumers can access even more of the company's streaming content all in one place, resulting in higher user engagement, lower churn and greater opportunities for advertisers. We're also very optimistic about the long-term advertising potential of this business. Even amid a challenging ad market, this quarter, we began seeing early signs of improvement. And I'm pleased to announce that as of the end of Q3, we've signed up 3.3 million subscribers to our ad-supported Disney+ option. Since its inception, 40% of new Disney+ subscribers are choosing an ad-supported product. On our pricing strategy, this year alone, we've raised prices in nearly 50 countries around the world to better reflect the value of our product offerings, and the impact on churn and retention has outperformed our expectations. Later today, we will release details regarding upcoming streaming price increases. And I'm pleased to share that our ad-supported Disney+ subscription offerings will become available in Canada and in select markets across Europe, beginning November 1, while a new ad-free bundled subscription plan featuring Disney+ and Hulu will be available in the U.S. on September 6. Maintaining access to our content for as broad an audience as possible is top of mind for us, which is why pricing for our stand-alone ad-supported Disney+ and Hulu offerings will remain unchanged. I'd also like to note that we are actively exploring ways to address account sharing and the best options for paying subscribers to share their accounts with friends and family. Later this year, we will begin to update our subscriber agreements with additional terms on our sharing policies and we will roll out tactics to drive monetization sometime in 2024. Our DTC ambitions also extend to our sports business. Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences. Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process. Looking to our broader linear business. While linear remains highly profitable for Disney today, the trends being fueled by cord cutting are unmistakable. And as I've stated before, we are thinking expansively and considering a variety of strategic options. However, we're fortunate to have an array of extremely productive television studios that we will rely on to continue providing exceptional content for audiences well into the future. And speaking of the content we create, I'd like to say a few words about the ongoing strikes. Nothing is more important to this company than its relationships with the creative community, and that includes actors, writers, animators, directors and producers. I have deep respect and appreciation for all those who are vital to the extraordinary creative engine that drives this company and our industry. And it is my fervent hope that we quickly find solutions to the issues that have kept us apart these past few months, and I am personally committed to working to achieve this result. In closing, I returned to Disney in November and have agreed to stay on longer because there is more to accomplish before our transformation is complete and because I want to ensure a successful transition for my successor. In spite of a challenging environment in the near term, I'm overwhelmingly bullish about Disney's future for the reasons I shared at the beginning of this call. The work we've done over these past eight months are core foundation of creative excellence and iconic brands and franchises and because of the unrivaled talent we have at every level here at Disney. I have the highest confidence in our leadership team today, and I'm enormously proud of the ways each of them is helping steer the company through this moment of great change. And with that, I'll turn things over to Kevin.\nKevin Lansberry: Thanks, Bob. It's good to be here and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal third quarter diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items were at $1.03, a decrease of $0.06 versus the prior year. In the coming months, we will be presenting recast financials in line with our new reorganized segments: Disney Entertainment, ESPN, and Parks, Experiences and Products. So today will be the last earnings call, where we will discuss our numbers under the existing structure. Now turning to this quarter's results. Starting off with direct-to-consumer. As Bob referenced earlier, we've improved direct-to-consumer operating results by $1 billion in just three quarters. For Q3, operating losses improved by approximately $150 million versus the prior quarter and by approximately $550 million versus the prior year. These results outperformed the guidance we gave on the last earnings call, largely due to lower-than-expected expenses, including from realizing SG&A savings sooner than initially expected. Disney+ core subscribers grew by nearly 800,000 during the third quarter, in line with the commentary we made at our last earnings call, with international growth more than offsetting modest domestic net losses. As Bob mentioned, our progress will vary from quarter-to-quarter and we are more focused on overall economics versus pure sub growth. But currently, we do expect that in the fourth quarter, we will see core Disney+ net adds rebound with growth both domestically and internationally. Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by $0.11 driven by higher per subscriber advertising revenue domestically, as well as price increases in certain international markets. With over 40% of gross adds opting for the ad tier, the domestic Disney+ ad tier is continuing to improve our ARPU. And we look forward to the additional market launches announced today, which should serve as a stepping stone on our path to profitability. Disney+ Hotstar subscribers declined this quarter as we adjusted our product from one centered around the IPL to one more balanced with other sports and entertainment offerings. I would also note that this business with its significantly lower ARPU compared to core Disney+ is not a material component of our overall D2C financial results. We will therefore continue to focus our commentary on the core Disney+ product. Hulu and ESPN+ subscribers were roughly comparable to Q2. Hulu remained profitable in the third quarter with advertising revenue increasing versus the second quarter, benefiting sequentially from a higher sell-through rate. In Q4, we expect D2C ad revenue to continue to benefit from higher advertiser demand at Hulu as well as from the ramp-up of the Disney+ ad tier. As we work toward achieving D2C profitability by the end of fiscal 2024, we don't necessarily expect the progress to be linear each quarter as the impacts of the transformative work we are doing take time to realize. We expect to see more meaningful improvement in our D2C losses by middle of fiscal 2024. These expectations and plans remain subject to all of the risks and assumptions we previously identified and are noting here today, which will require close and ongoing assessment. But we remain encouraged by the early results we've already realized and are optimistic about our path ahead. Moving on to our content sales line of business. Operating results declined by a little over $200 million versus the prior year. Lower results in the third quarter versus the prior year were due to lower TV/SVOD and theatrical results. For Q4, we expect this business to generate operating losses up to $100 million worse than last year's fourth quarter. And at Linear Networks, operating income declined versus the prior year by $580 million driven by declines at both domestic and international channels. The decrease at domestic channels was driven by lower advertising and affiliate revenue and by higher programming and production costs driven by the NBA and the new Formula One agreement. While domestic linear advertising revenue declined year-over-year, ESPN ad revenue increased by 4%, demonstrating the relative strength of sports. Quarter-to-date, ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing down, reflecting in part the absence of the Big 10 this year. It's worth noting, however, that the absence of the Big 10 is expected to drive overall operating income favorability in Q4 versus the prior year. The fourth quarter will also hold one additional Monday night football game versus the prior year. Linear advertising continues to see impacts from market softness. While sports is healthy, entertainment continues to face headwinds. Note that we expect D2C advertising year-over-year growth to partially offset linear declines in the fourth quarter. And we wrap this year's upfront with overall volume roughly in line with the prior year. Growth in addressable revenue increased, representing over 40% of the total upfront volume, and sports pricing is up single digits across the board. Domestic Linear Networks affiliate revenue decreased by 2% from the prior year due to a 6-point decline from fewer subscribers, partially offset by 4 points of growth from contractual rate increases. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower advertising revenue and to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Our Parks, Experiences and Products portfolio of businesses continues to be an earnings and free cash flow growth driver for the company, with both revenue and operating income increasing by more than 10% versus the prior year. International parks continued its strong growth trend with year-over-year operating income increasing at all our international sites, but most significantly at Shanghai Disney, which saw record highs from a revenue, OI and margin perspective. At domestic Parks and Experiences, operating income was up 24% versus pre-pandemic results in fiscal '19, but declined 13% versus the prior year. In addition to the inflationary cost pressures we have discussed on prior calls and some of the near-term headwinds at Walt Disney World that Bob mentioned earlier, results reflect an approximately $100 million accelerated depreciation charge related to the closure of the Galactic Starcruiser. These drivers were partially offset by favorable performance at our Cruise Line and at the Disneyland Resort. While Walt Disney World results were down year-over-year, as Bob mentioned, operating income was nearly 30% higher versus 2019 when adjusting for the Starcruiser accelerated depreciation. Domestic parks attendance grew slightly year-over-year, reflecting comparisons against last year's strong trends coming out of the 50th anniversary at Walt Disney World. Per cap spending was comparable to the prior year with contributions from pricing, Genie+ and higher food and beverage spend offset by attendance composition changes and lower merchandise spend. Excluding the impact of the Starcruiser accelerated depreciation, domestic parks and Experiences operating margins in Q3 were roughly 3 percentage points below the prior year, and DPEP margins were slightly higher than the prior year. We continue to expect some moderation in demand at our domestic parks, as we compare against our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and the burn-off of pent-up demand persists, while elevated travel costs are impacting international visitation. We are also seeing continued cost pressures in the fourth quarter, predominantly from labor wage rate growth, coupled with $150 million of remaining accelerated depreciation for the Galactic Starcruiser. However, we still expect all-in Q4 operating margins at DPEP to exceed the prior year due to the ongoing strength of recovery at our international parks and Cruise Line. Putting this all together, excluding the impact of accelerated depreciation for the Starcruiser, we are still expecting full year total company revenue and segment operating income to grow at a high-single digit percentage rate versus the prior year. We currently expect fiscal 2023 content spend to come in at approximately $27 billion, which is lower than we previously guided due to lower spend on produced content, in part due to the writers' and actors' strikes. We now expect capital expenditures for the year to total $5 billion. This is lower than our prior guide, primarily due to spending timing shifts for various projects across the enterprise. In the midst of the transformative work we have been doing, we are prioritizing long-term free cash flow growth and have generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with our single A credit ratings reflecting that strength. We have made significant progress deleveraging coming out of the pandemic, and we continue to approach capital allocation in a disciplined and balanced manner, prioritizing investments to generate future growth while also keeping an eye towards shareholder returns. And to that point, as we've mentioned before, we still expect to be in a position to recommend that the Board declared a modest dividend by the end of this calendar year with the intention to recommend increased shareholder returns over time as our earnings and free cash flow power grows. And with that, I will turn it back over to Alexia for Q&A.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Kevin. As we transition to the Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many as possible today. And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi. Thank you. Bob, the linear business is clearly under pressure and you made it clear recently that all options are being considered. I'm curious, though, what the practical considerations are of separating assets like ABC, National Geographic or others from both ESPN or sports or integrated or from Hulu, which is kind of the next-generation distribution platform. Can you talk about that? And then second, can we assume that most of those TV assets have been fully depreciated? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Clearly, if we are to do anything significant in terms of, call it, strategic direction to the linear nets, we have to keep in mind the need for content to ultimately fuel our DTC businesses, notably and as you mentioned Hulu. So anything that is to be done would be done with an eye toward maintaining a rich flow of content to fuel our growth business, and that will be streaming. There's obviously complexity as it relates to decoupling the linear nets from ESPN, but nothing that we feel we can't contend with if we were to ultimately create strategic realignment.\nKevin Lansberry: And Phil, this is Kevin. With respect to the assets, these have been around for quite a while at this point and we're not going to comment specifically on where they sit from a depreciation standpoint.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from BoA. Please go ahead with your question.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Bob, maybe just a follow-up on your prepared remarks and film being core strategic. Can you share with us how you plan to improve the movie performance and maybe the time frame or create more original content? Just give us more color. And then a follow-up to something you said on DTC and password crackdown, is this a fiscal '24 full year? Like will you be done by the end of the year and is it on a global basis? How many password shares do you think there are on your platform?\nRobert Iger: So the second part of your question, Jessica, regarding password sharing, we are -- we already have the technical capability to monitor much of this. And I'm not going to give you a specific number, except to say that it's significant. What we don't know, of course, is as we get to work on this, how much of the password sharing as we basically eliminate it will convert to growth in subs. Obviously, we believe there will be some, but we're not speculating. What we are saying, though, is that in calendar '24, we're going to get at this issue. And so while it is likely you'll see some impact in calendar '24, it's possible that we won't be complete or the work will not be completed within the calendar year. But we certainly have established this as a real priority and we actually think that there's an opportunity here to help us grow our business. Regarding our studio performance, let's put things in perspective a little bit. The studio has had a tremendous run over the last decade, perhaps the greatest run that any studio has ever had with multiple billion-dollar hits and including, by the way, too, that were relatively recent were one, in particular, Avatar: The Way of Water. And we also had a pretty strong performance with Guardians of the Galaxy 3, which has done, I think, approximately $850 million in global box office. That said, the performance of some of our recent films has definitely been disappointing and we don't take that lightly. And as you'd expect, we're very focused on improving the quality and the performance of the films that we've got coming up. It's something that I'm working closely with the studio on. I'm personally committed to spending more time and attention on that as well.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you. Good afternoon. Bob, we've -- the press is out with the price increase information for later this year tonight. I'm just wondering now that you've been through one Disney+ price increase here in the U.S. and multiple Hulu and ESPN increases sort of how you're thinking about the pricing power of the product as you go into these even more significant increases and whether you think you can hold your customer base as you raise prices. And obviously, some big news with ESPN Bet. Why now and why PENN? Can you just talk about your vision or Jimmy's vision for the ESPN product over time that stems from this announcement and other thoughts on ESPN's future?\nRobert Iger: Ben, as you know, I think as we've said before, we took a pretty significant price increase at Disney+ sometime late in calendar '22. And we really didn't see significant churn or loss of subs because of that, which was actually heartening. It's important to note, though, that the price increase that we've just announced is a price increase for the premium product or the non-advertiser-supported product. We're actually keeping the advertiser supported product flat in terms of prices. That's being done for a reason. Obviously, as has been noted by Kevin in his remarks, the advertising marketplace for streaming is picking up. It's more healthy than the advertising marketplace for linear television. We believe in the future of advertising on our streaming platforms, both Disney+ and Hulu. And we're obviously trying with our pricing strategy to migrate more subs to the advertiser-supported tier. It also should be noted, as I think I mentioned in my remarks, that a substantial amount of new subscribers to Disney+ are signing up for the ad-supported tier, which suggests that the pricing is working for us in that regard. So we're looking at this very carefully. One thing I think that I should also note is that we grew this business really fast, really before we even understood what our pricing strategy should be or could be. And we're really just getting at, and I'd say in the last six months, the pricing strategy that's really aimed at enabling us to improve the bottom line ultimately to turn this into a growth business and as a component of that, obviously, to grow subs.\nBenjamin Swinburne: On ESPN?\nRobert Iger: On ESPN Bet, you say why now? Well, we've been in discussions with a number of entities over a fairly long period of time. It's something that we've wanted to accomplish, obviously, because we believe there's an opportunity here to significantly grow engagement with ESPN consumers, particularly young consumers. And PENN, why PENN? Because PENN stepped up in a very aggressive way and made an offer to us that was better than any of the competitive offers by far. And we like the fact that PENN is going to use this as a growth engine for their business. And we actually believe and trust in their ability to \u2013 in this partnership to grow their business nicely while we grow ours.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks, Hey, Bob. I have a few, if you could. One is, given the thinking you've done about the future of Disney, why does it make sense to create two Disney companies: one focused on parks, CP, Disney+ and then the studio IP that drives that flywheel, and then one on everything else? So why not make a clean break? And then secondly, on ESPN, you've been talking about partnerships. I wonder if you have a vision for the streaming content vision of ESPN that's different than the linear one we see, perhaps a sports funded with other networks or with lead partnership. So can you just expand on how the product will look differently down the road in streaming than it does now and late on (ph)?\nRobert Iger: Michael, on the first part, I'm not going to comment on the future structure of the company or the asset makeup of the company. As I've said, we're looking at strategic options both for ESPN and for the Linear Networks, obviously, addressing all the challenges that those businesses are facing. I'm looking forward to reading your thesis on it. Maybe you'll give us some ideas about it, but I'm not going to make any comments about it right now. Regarding the second question and ESPN, the strategic partnerships that we're looking to create and that we're actually in discussions about are aimed at accomplishing a few things: one, content, meaning increasing the content that ESPN offers; and two, possibly, I'll call it distribution and marketing support. And it's possible that we'll be able to do both as -- and this is all being done with an eye toward the inevitability of taking the SPN flagship over the top. So when we look ahead and we see a business that will be a direct -- primarily a direct-to-consumer business, we obviously have an eye toward how much content do we need in order to make that a successful business. That obviously ties to what the pricing model need to be and actually, how much distribution support we need. We benefited greatly from the distribution support in the old business model from cable and satellite. Obviously, when you go DTC, you're kind of doing it on your own or maybe not or maybe there's an opportunity with another entity to help in that regard. So we're basically looking quite expansively. I must say we're extremely encouraged with all the interest that we've had already in this regard. And I think it's safe to assume, as we ultimately turn this into a streaming business, while we have a phenomenal hand right now better than anyone else in terms of the content that ESPN offers that -- we believe that adding more content in under economical circumstances might be a wise thing.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. Thanks, Bob.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you. Bob, you said you're now on track to exceed that initial goal of $5.5 billion in cost savings, and DTC came in ahead in the quarter. As you think about the future of this business long term and getting to kind of the price and cost structure that you're aiming for, do you have any expectations for longer-term DTC margins? It just seems like you're meaningfully below where Netflix was at a similar revenue scale. So I'm wondering how you think about that 15% or 20% margin level as that business gets above $20 billion in revenue this year. And then just secondly, as a follow-up, given that you have the Hulu put coming up next year, what are your thoughts on your ability to fund that transaction as we head into that time horizon? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Our streaming business is still actually very young. In fact, it's not even four years old. It launched in November of 2019. And we love to have the margins that Netflix has. They've accomplished those margins though, over a substantially longer period of time and they've done so because they figured out how to really carefully balance their investment in programming with their pricing strategy and what they spend in marketing. Because we're new at all of this, we actually have not really achieved the kind of balance we know we need to achieve in terms of cost savings and pricing and money spent on marketing. And of course, all the other things that we're looking at from a technological perspective that grows engagement with our customers, for instance, recommendation engines would be one example of that, that have the ability to improve performance or obviously grow consumption. So I would say that -- and I obviously have to -- I can't emphasize enough the time that we spent and the effort that we spent on managing costs. We've done a tremendous job in a very, very short period of time of exceeding the cost reductions that we said we were going to achieve and that's obviously a major step in the direction of improving our margins. Pricing, as we've talked about earlier on this call and in our comments, is another way to do that. Password sharing is another way to do that. Getting the technology in place to grow engagement, the advertising side of this business is another. So I'm reasonably optimistic and hopeful that we will be improving our margins in this business significantly over the next few years. But I'm not going to make any further predictions in that except -- the good news is that we know how much work we have to do. We know the work that we have to do as well.\nKevin Lansberry: And Steven, I'll answer the question with respect to Hulu put. So I'll remind everyone that the floor to that put is about $9.2 billion. We're very comfortable with our current liquidity position. We've got about $11.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet, got about $10.5 billion worth of revolving credit facilities and commercial paper. And so we -- and we're going to have plenty of future cash flow to help fund all of this going forward. I would also like to note that from a balance sheet perspective, we've got a strong single A credit rating that reflects the strength that we see in our balance sheet. We made significant progress recently, deleveraging coming out of the pandemic. We're prioritizing free cash flow as a company. And we're being really disciplined and smart about how we go about allocating capital across the company. And last but not least, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we hope to still be in a position \u2013 or we plan to still be in a position at the end of this year to recommend to the Board of Directors that we put a modest dividend out.\nAlexia Quadrani: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So Bob, I mean, on the ESPN side, you've spoken about the need for partners. Could you talk a little bit about the priorities when you look at partners? Is it more in the form of direct capital infusion or maybe some kind of reach on the distribution side when it comes to streaming? What are the objectives you're really solving for? And then, Kevin, maybe as a follow-up to the guidance, just triangulating between some of the segment guidance that you just gave and trends in the first three quarters. The full year high-single digit guide in the operation is obviously great. But it will need more acceleration in Q4 than we've seen in the first three quarters of OI. So if you could just talk through what the drivers of that acceleration, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Kannan, we're not necessarily looking for cash infusion when it comes to partners. We're looking for partners that are going to help ESPN successfully transition to a DTC model. And that, as I've said, can come in the form of either content or distribution and marketing support or both.\nAlexia Quadrani: And Kannan, can you repeat your second question, please?\nKannan Venkateshwar: So in terms of the guidance for high-single digit OI growth, just triangulating between the trends in the first three quarters and some of the segment guidance in the quarter, it seems to imply growth in the fourth quarter will be higher for OI. And so I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that acceleration.\nKevin Lansberry: Yeah, Kannan. There's very significant growth across our direct-to-consumer business and at our Parks and Experiences business also. So those two businesses predominantly are the big growth drivers as you begin to look at relative to the prior year where we\u2019re getting that kind of growth.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. So I'm curious how your experience with Disney+ Hotstar shape your view on your long-term international streaming strategy. Are you thinking about maybe exiting those markets or any markets and maybe focusing more on content licensing or partnerships? And is it essential that you reshape that international strategy in any way to meet your long-term profitability objectives?\nRobert Iger: We actually have been looking at multiple markets around the world with an eye toward prioritizing those that are going to help us turn this business into a profitable business. What that basically means is there are some markets that we will invest less in local programming but still maintain the service. There are some markets that we may not have a service at all. And there are others that we'll consider, I'll call it, high-potential markets where we'll invest nicely for local programming, marketing and basically full-service content in those markets. Basically, what I\u2019m saying is not all markets are created equal. And in terms of our march to profitability, one of the ways we believe we\u2019re going to do that is by creating priorities internationally.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris from Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Morris: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. So on the theme of considering options for Disney, there was an article published recently that speculated that the entire company could be sold to a larger technology company. So Bob, my straightforward question is, do you see a plausible scenario where the entire company would be sold? Maybe a bit more broadly, though, when you think of maximum value of the Disney enterprise, do you think that can be achieved by being more aligned with a single technology partner or is that value maximized through partnering with a variety of tech platforms? And if I could just sneak one in on the PENN Gaming announcement. Does it -- will you forego advertising partnerships with all other betting or sports gaming partners? And if so, how much impact will that have in exchange for building value in this partnership?\nRobert Iger: Michael, I just am not going to speculate about the potential for Disney to be acquired by any company, whether a technology company or not. Obviously, anyone who want to speculate about these things would have to immediately consider the global regulatory environment. I'll say no more than that. It's just -- it's not something that we obsess about.\nKevin Lansberry: Great. And then, Michael, with respect to any foregone economics or no longer accepting advertising from other gaming companies, I don't see us in a position where we'll ever be in that situation. So...\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thanks for the question, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Iger",
            "content": "Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon. In the eight months since I returned, we've undertaken an unprecedented transformation at Disney and this quarter's earnings reflect some of what we have accomplished. First, the company was completely restructured, restoring creativity to the center of our business. We made important management changes and efficiency improvements to create a more cost-effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations. We aggressively reduced costs across the enterprise and we're on track to exceed our initial goal of $5.5 billion in savings. And perhaps most importantly, we've improved our DTC operating income by roughly $1 billion in just three quarters, as we continue to work toward achieving DTC profitability by the end of fiscal 2024. I'm pleased with how much we've gotten done in such a short period of time, but I also know we have a lot more to do. Before I turn the call over to Kevin Lansberry, our Interim CFO, I'd like to elaborate on the state of our company and the transformative work we are still undertaking. As I've said before, our progress will not always be linear. But despite near-term headwinds, I'm incredibly confident in Disney's long-term trajectory because of the work we've done, the team we have in place and because of Disney's core intellectual property foundation. Moving forward, I believe three businesses will drive the greatest growth and value creation over the next five years. They are our film studios, our parks business and streaming, all of which are inextricably linked to our brands and franchises. Looking to Disney Entertainment studios, we're focused on improving the quality of our films and on better economics, not just reducing the number of titles we release but also the cost per title. And we're maximizing the full impact of our titles by embracing the multiple distribution windows at our disposal, enabling consumers to access their content in multiple ways. For example, Avatar: The Way of Water, which is now the third highest grossing film of all time, is also on track to be the biggest ever electronic home video release for Disney domestically. Certain other titles will be sold in the download-to-own window as well. By focusing on big franchises and tentpole films, we're able to generate interest in our existing library. For example, we're seeing tremendous engagement on Disney+ with the previous Guardians of the Galaxy films, the original Avatar and the first four Indiana Jones movies. But the value of our Disney entertainment studios and the reason this will be a key growth business for us extends far beyond our library and new releases. What sets Disney apart are the numerous ways we're able to reach consumers with the stories and characters they love, including in our parks and resorts. We'll be opening new Frozen theme lands at Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris as well as the Zootopia theme land at Shanghai Disney Resort. And later down the road, we will be bringing an Avatar experience to Disneyland, reinforcing the unrivaled worldwide appeal of our brands and franchises. Our Parks and Experience segment overall has had an impressive streak and will continue to be a key growth engine for the company, even as we navigate the cycles that come with operating this business. Our Cruise Line in particular showed strong revenue and operating income growth in the third quarter. Current Q4 booked occupancy for our existing fleet of five ships is at 98% and we will be expanding our fleet by adding two more ships in fiscal '25 and another in fiscal '26, nearly doubling our worldwide capacity. In addition to our Cruise Line, strong segment results for the quarter were driven by solid performance at our international parks, and we also saw continued strength at Disneyland Resort. Our Asia parks have been doing exceptionally well, reinforcing a clear opportunity for continued growth. Both Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland have experienced stronger-than-expected recoveries from the pandemic. And in Q3, they both grew meaningfully in revenue, operating income and attendance. We saw softer performance at Walt Disney World from the prior year, coming off our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration. Also as post-COVID pent-up demand continues to level off in Florida, local tax data shows evidence of some softening in several major Florida tourism markets. And the strong dollar is expected to continue tamping down international visitation to the state. However, Walt Disney World is still performing well above pre-COVID levels, 21% higher in revenue and 29% higher in operating income compared to fiscal 2019, adjusting for Starcruiser accelerated depreciation. And following a number of recent changes we've implemented, we continue to see positive guest experience ratings in our theme parks, including Walt Disney World and positive indicators for guests looking to book future visits. This includes strong demand for our newly returned annual passes. We're making numerous investments globally to grow our parks business over the next five years, and I'm very optimistic about the future of this business over the long term. The third area that will drive growth and value creation for Disney is our direct-to-consumer business. When you consider our path to profitability in streaming, it's important to remember where we started and how we've adapted based on what we've learned. We overachieved with massive subscriber growth for Disney+ out of the gate and we leaned into a spending level to fuel subscriber growth, which had been the key measure of success for many. All of this happened while we were still determining the right strategies for pricing, marketing, content and specific international market investments. However, since my return, we've reset the whole business around economics designed to deliver significant, sustained profitability. We're prioritizing the strength of our brands and franchises. We're rationalizing the volume of content we make, what we spend and what markets we invest in. We're deploying the technology necessary to both improve the user experience as well as the economics of this business. We're harnessing windowing opportunities, perfecting our pricing and marketing strategies, maximizing our enormous advertising potential and we're making extensive Hulu content available to bundle subscribers via Disney+. As I announced last quarter, we're moving closer toward a more unified one-app experience domestically to pair high-quality general entertainment with content from our popular brands and franchises for our bundle subscribers. It's a formula for success that we have already proven in international markets with our Star offering on Disney+. We see a future where consumers can access even more of the company's streaming content all in one place, resulting in higher user engagement, lower churn and greater opportunities for advertisers. We're also very optimistic about the long-term advertising potential of this business. Even amid a challenging ad market, this quarter, we began seeing early signs of improvement. And I'm pleased to announce that as of the end of Q3, we've signed up 3.3 million subscribers to our ad-supported Disney+ option. Since its inception, 40% of new Disney+ subscribers are choosing an ad-supported product. On our pricing strategy, this year alone, we've raised prices in nearly 50 countries around the world to better reflect the value of our product offerings, and the impact on churn and retention has outperformed our expectations. Later today, we will release details regarding upcoming streaming price increases. And I'm pleased to share that our ad-supported Disney+ subscription offerings will become available in Canada and in select markets across Europe, beginning November 1, while a new ad-free bundled subscription plan featuring Disney+ and Hulu will be available in the U.S. on September 6. Maintaining access to our content for as broad an audience as possible is top of mind for us, which is why pricing for our stand-alone ad-supported Disney+ and Hulu offerings will remain unchanged. I'd also like to note that we are actively exploring ways to address account sharing and the best options for paying subscribers to share their accounts with friends and family. Later this year, we will begin to update our subscriber agreements with additional terms on our sharing policies and we will roll out tactics to drive monetization sometime in 2024. Our DTC ambitions also extend to our sports business. Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences. Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process. Looking to our broader linear business. While linear remains highly profitable for Disney today, the trends being fueled by cord cutting are unmistakable. And as I've stated before, we are thinking expansively and considering a variety of strategic options. However, we're fortunate to have an array of extremely productive television studios that we will rely on to continue providing exceptional content for audiences well into the future. And speaking of the content we create, I'd like to say a few words about the ongoing strikes. Nothing is more important to this company than its relationships with the creative community, and that includes actors, writers, animators, directors and producers. I have deep respect and appreciation for all those who are vital to the extraordinary creative engine that drives this company and our industry. And it is my fervent hope that we quickly find solutions to the issues that have kept us apart these past few months, and I am personally committed to working to achieve this result. In closing, I returned to Disney in November and have agreed to stay on longer because there is more to accomplish before our transformation is complete and because I want to ensure a successful transition for my successor. In spite of a challenging environment in the near term, I'm overwhelmingly bullish about Disney's future for the reasons I shared at the beginning of this call. The work we've done over these past eight months are core foundation of creative excellence and iconic brands and franchises and because of the unrivaled talent we have at every level here at Disney. I have the highest confidence in our leadership team today, and I'm enormously proud of the ways each of them is helping steer the company through this moment of great change. And with that, I'll turn things over to Kevin. Clearly, if we are to do anything significant in terms of, call it, strategic direction to the linear nets, we have to keep in mind the need for content to ultimately fuel our DTC businesses, notably and as you mentioned Hulu. So anything that is to be done would be done with an eye toward maintaining a rich flow of content to fuel our growth business, and that will be streaming. There's obviously complexity as it relates to decoupling the linear nets from ESPN, but nothing that we feel we can't contend with if we were to ultimately create strategic realignment. So the second part of your question, Jessica, regarding password sharing, we are -- we already have the technical capability to monitor much of this. And I'm not going to give you a specific number, except to say that it's significant. What we don't know, of course, is as we get to work on this, how much of the password sharing as we basically eliminate it will convert to growth in subs. Obviously, we believe there will be some, but we're not speculating. What we are saying, though, is that in calendar '24, we're going to get at this issue. And so while it is likely you'll see some impact in calendar '24, it's possible that we won't be complete or the work will not be completed within the calendar year. But we certainly have established this as a real priority and we actually think that there's an opportunity here to help us grow our business. Regarding our studio performance, let's put things in perspective a little bit. The studio has had a tremendous run over the last decade, perhaps the greatest run that any studio has ever had with multiple billion-dollar hits and including, by the way, too, that were relatively recent were one, in particular, Avatar: The Way of Water. And we also had a pretty strong performance with Guardians of the Galaxy 3, which has done, I think, approximately $850 million in global box office. That said, the performance of some of our recent films has definitely been disappointing and we don't take that lightly. And as you'd expect, we're very focused on improving the quality and the performance of the films that we've got coming up. It's something that I'm working closely with the studio on. I'm personally committed to spending more time and attention on that as well. Ben, as you know, I think as we've said before, we took a pretty significant price increase at Disney+ sometime late in calendar '22. And we really didn't see significant churn or loss of subs because of that, which was actually heartening. It's important to note, though, that the price increase that we've just announced is a price increase for the premium product or the non-advertiser-supported product. We're actually keeping the advertiser supported product flat in terms of prices. That's being done for a reason. Obviously, as has been noted by Kevin in his remarks, the advertising marketplace for streaming is picking up. It's more healthy than the advertising marketplace for linear television. We believe in the future of advertising on our streaming platforms, both Disney+ and Hulu. And we're obviously trying with our pricing strategy to migrate more subs to the advertiser-supported tier. It also should be noted, as I think I mentioned in my remarks, that a substantial amount of new subscribers to Disney+ are signing up for the ad-supported tier, which suggests that the pricing is working for us in that regard. So we're looking at this very carefully. One thing I think that I should also note is that we grew this business really fast, really before we even understood what our pricing strategy should be or could be. And we're really just getting at, and I'd say in the last six months, the pricing strategy that's really aimed at enabling us to improve the bottom line ultimately to turn this into a growth business and as a component of that, obviously, to grow subs. On ESPN Bet, you say why now? Well, we've been in discussions with a number of entities over a fairly long period of time. It's something that we've wanted to accomplish, obviously, because we believe there's an opportunity here to significantly grow engagement with ESPN consumers, particularly young consumers. And PENN, why PENN? Because PENN stepped up in a very aggressive way and made an offer to us that was better than any of the competitive offers by far. And we like the fact that PENN is going to use this as a growth engine for their business. And we actually believe and trust in their ability to \u2013 in this partnership to grow their business nicely while we grow ours. Michael, on the first part, I'm not going to comment on the future structure of the company or the asset makeup of the company. As I've said, we're looking at strategic options both for ESPN and for the Linear Networks, obviously, addressing all the challenges that those businesses are facing. I'm looking forward to reading your thesis on it. Maybe you'll give us some ideas about it, but I'm not going to make any comments about it right now.

And I think it's safe to assume, as we ultimately turn this into a streaming business, while we have a phenomenal hand right now better than anyone else in terms of the content that ESPN offers that -- we believe that adding more content in under economical circumstances might be a wise thing. Our streaming business is still actually very young. In fact, it's not even four years old. It launched in November of 2019. And we love to have the margins that Netflix has.

Pricing, as we've talked about earlier on this call and in our comments, is another way to do that. Password sharing is another way to do that. Getting the technology in place to grow engagement, the advertising side of this business is another. So I'm reasonably optimistic and hopeful that we will be improving our margins in this business significantly over the next few years. But I'm not going to make any further predictions in that except -- the good news is that we know how much work we have to do. We know the work that we have to do as well. Kannan, we're not necessarily looking for cash infusion when it comes to partners. We're looking for partners that are going to help ESPN successfully transition to a DTC model. And that, as I've said, can come in the form of either content or distribution and marketing support or both. We actually have been looking at multiple markets around the world with an eye toward prioritizing those that are going to help us turn this business into a profitable business.

Basically, what I'm saying is not all markets are created equal. And in terms of our march to profitability, one of the ways we believe we're going to do that is by creating priorities internationally. Michael, I just am not going to speculate about the potential for Disney to be acquired by any company, whether a technology company or not. Obviously, anyone who want to speculate about these things would have to immediately consider the global regulatory environment. I'll say no more than that. It's just -- it's not something that we obsess about."

            "content": "Thanks, Bob. It's good to be here and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal third quarter diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items were at $1.03, a decrease of $0.06 versus the prior year. In the coming months, we will be presenting recast financials in line with our new reorganized segments: Disney Entertainment, ESPN, and Parks, Experiences and Products. So today will be the last earnings call, where we will discuss our numbers under the existing structure. Now turning to this quarter's results. Starting off with direct-to-consumer. As Bob referenced earlier, we've improved direct-to-consumer operating results by $1 billion in just three quarters. For Q3, operating losses improved by approximately $150 million versus the prior quarter and by approximately $550 million versus the prior year. These results outperformed the guidance we gave on the last earnings call, largely due to lower-than-expected expenses, including from realizing SG&A savings sooner than initially expected. Disney+ core subscribers grew by nearly 800,000 during the third quarter, in line with the commentary we made at our last earnings call, with international growth more than offsetting modest domestic net losses. As Bob mentioned, our progress will vary from quarter-to-quarter and we are more focused on overall economics versus pure sub growth. But currently, we do expect that in the fourth quarter, we will see core Disney+ net adds rebound with growth both domestically and internationally. Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by $0.11 driven by higher per subscriber advertising revenue domestically, as well as price increases in certain international markets. With over 40% of gross adds opting for the ad tier, the domestic Disney+ ad tier is continuing to improve our ARPU. And we look forward to the additional market launches announced today, which should serve as a stepping stone on our path to profitability. Disney+ Hotstar subscribers declined this quarter as we adjusted our product from one centered around the IPL to one more balanced with other sports and entertainment offerings. I would also note that this business with its significantly lower ARPU compared to core Disney+ is not a material component of our overall D2C financial results. We will therefore continue to focus our commentary on the core Disney+ product. Hulu and ESPN+ subscribers were roughly comparable to Q2. Hulu remained profitable in the third quarter with advertising revenue increasing versus the second quarter, benefiting sequentially from a higher sell-through rate. In Q4, we expect D2C ad revenue to continue to benefit from higher advertiser demand at Hulu as well as from the ramp-up of the Disney+ ad tier. As we work toward achieving D2C profitability by the end of fiscal 2024, we don't necessarily expect the progress to be linear each quarter as the impacts of the transformative work we are doing take time to realize. We expect to see more meaningful improvement in our D2C losses by middle of fiscal 2024. These expectations and plans remain subject to all of the risks and assumptions we previously identified and are noting here today, which will require close and ongoing assessment. But we remain encouraged by the early results we've already realized and are optimistic about our path ahead. Moving on to our content sales line of business. Operating results declined by a little over $200 million versus the prior year. Lower results in the third quarter versus the prior year were due to lower TV/SVOD and theatrical results. For Q4, we expect this business to generate operating losses up to $100 million worse than last year's fourth quarter. And at Linear Networks, operating income declined versus the prior year by $580 million driven by declines at both domestic and international channels. The decrease at domestic channels was driven by lower advertising and affiliate revenue and by higher programming and production costs driven by the NBA and the new Formula One agreement. While domestic linear advertising revenue declined year-over-year, ESPN ad revenue increased by 4%, demonstrating the relative strength of sports. Quarter-to-date, ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing down, reflecting in part the absence of the Big 10 this year. It's worth noting, however, that the absence of the Big 10 is expected to drive overall operating income favorability in Q4 versus the prior year. The fourth quarter will also hold one additional Monday night football game versus the prior year. Linear advertising continues to see impacts from market softness. While sports is healthy, entertainment continues to face headwinds. Note that we expect D2C advertising year-over-year growth to partially offset linear declines in the fourth quarter. And we wrap this year's upfront with overall volume roughly in line with the prior year. Growth in addressable revenue increased, representing over 40% of the total upfront volume, and sports pricing is up single digits across the board. Domestic Linear Networks affiliate revenue decreased by 2% from the prior year due to a 6-point decline from fewer subscribers, partially offset by 4 points of growth from contractual rate increases. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower advertising revenue and to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Our Parks, Experiences and Products portfolio of businesses continues to be an earnings and free cash flow growth driver for the company, with both revenue and operating income increasing by more than 10% versus the prior year. International parks continued its strong growth trend with year-over-year operating income increasing at all our international sites, but most significantly at Shanghai Disney, which saw record highs from a revenue, OI and margin perspective. At domestic Parks and Experiences, operating income was up 24% versus pre-pandemic results in fiscal '19, but declined 13% versus the prior year. In addition to the inflationary cost pressures we have discussed on prior calls and some of the near-term headwinds at Walt Disney World that Bob mentioned earlier, results reflect an approximately $100 million accelerated depreciation charge related to the closure of the Galactic Starcruiser. These drivers were partially offset by favorable performance at our Cruise Line and at the Disneyland Resort. While Walt Disney World results were down year-over-year, as Bob mentioned, operating income was nearly 30% higher versus 2019 when adjusting for the Starcruiser accelerated depreciation. Domestic parks attendance grew slightly year-over-year, reflecting comparisons against last year's strong trends coming out of the 50th anniversary at Walt Disney World. Per cap spending was comparable to the prior year with contributions from pricing, Genie+ and higher food and beverage spend offset by attendance composition changes and lower merchandise spend. Excluding the impact of the Starcruiser accelerated depreciation, domestic parks and Experiences operating margins in Q3 were roughly 3 percentage points below the prior year, and DPEP margins were slightly higher than the prior year. We continue to expect some moderation in demand at our domestic parks, as we compare against our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and the burn-off of pent-up demand persists, while elevated travel costs are impacting international visitation. We are also seeing continued cost pressures in the fourth quarter, predominantly from labor wage rate growth, coupled with $150 million of remaining accelerated depreciation for the Galactic Starcruiser. However, we still expect all-in Q4 operating margins at DPEP to exceed the prior year due to the ongoing strength of recovery at our international parks and Cruise Line. Putting this all together, excluding the impact of accelerated depreciation for the Starcruiser, we are still expecting full year total company revenue and segment operating income to grow at a high-single digit percentage rate versus the prior year. We currently expect fiscal 2023 content spend to come in at approximately $27 billion, which is lower than we previously guided due to lower spend on produced content, in part due to the writers' and actors' strikes. We now expect capital expenditures for the year to total $5 billion. This is lower than our prior guide, primarily due to spending timing shifts for various projects across the enterprise. In the midst of the transformative work we have been doing, we are prioritizing long-term free cash flow growth and have generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with our single A credit ratings reflecting that strength. We have made significant progress deleveraging coming out of the pandemic, and we continue to approach capital allocation in a disciplined and balanced manner, prioritizing investments to generate future growth while also keeping an eye towards shareholder returns. And to that point, as we've mentioned before, we still expect to be in a position to recommend that the Board declared a modest dividend by the end of this calendar year with the intention to recommend increased shareholder returns over time as our earnings and free cash flow power grows. And with that, I will turn it back over to Alexia for Q&A. And Phil, this is Kevin. With respect to the assets, these have been around for quite a while at this point and we're not going to comment specifically on where they sit from a depreciation standpoint. And Steven, I'll answer the question with respect to Hulu put. So I'll remind everyone that the floor to that put is about $9.2 billion. We're very comfortable with our current liquidity position. We've got about $11.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet, got about $10.5 billion worth of revolving credit facilities and commercial paper. And so we -- and we're going to have plenty of future cash flow to help fund all of this going forward. I would also like to note that from a balance sheet perspective, we've got a strong single A credit rating that reflects the strength that we see in our balance sheet. We made significant progress recently, deleveraging coming out of the pandemic. We're prioritizing free cash flow as a company. And we're being really disciplined and smart about how we go about allocating capital across the company. And last but not least, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we hope to still be in a position \u2013 or we plan to still be in a position at the end of this year to recommend to the Board of Directors that we put a modest dividend out. Yeah, Kannan. There's very significant growth across our direct-to-consumer business and at our Parks and Experiences business also. So those two businesses predominantly are the big growth drivers as you begin to look at relative to the prior year where we're getting that kind of growth. Great. And then, Michael, with respect to any foregone economics or no longer accepting advertising from other gaming companies, I don't see us in a position where we'll ever be in that situation. So..."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay and a transcript will also be made available on our website. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nRobert Iger: Thank you Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Allow me to digress for a moment to congratulate Universal for the tremendous success of Super Mario Brothers. It certainly proves people love to be entertained in theatres around the world and it gives us reason to be optimistic about the movie business. Now turning to our results. We're pleased with our accomplishments this quarter, which are reflective of the strategic changes we've been making throughout our businesses. We're also proud of what we continue to deliver for consumers, from movies to television to sports, news and our theme parks. A few recent highlights include Marvel Studios Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, which topped the global box office in its opening weekend with $289 million. The first round of the NBA playoffs was the most watched ever across Disney networks, and we've been averaging 5 million viewers throughout the first 22 games, up 15% versus the comparable point in last year's playoffs. ABC continued its run as the number one entertainment broadcast network for the fourth consecutive season. And at our domestic parks, we continued to improve the guest experience with our recent pricing changes and exciting new attractions, including the Reimagined Mickey's Toontown at Disneyland and TRON Lightcycle Run at Walt Disney World. I've been back at the company for almost six months, and in that time we've embarked on a significant transformation to strategically realign Disney for sustained growth and success. I\u2019m pleased to say that the strategy we detailed last quarter is working. Our new organizational structure is returning authority and accountability to our creative leaders, as well as allowing for a more efficient, coordinated, and streamlined approach to our operations. The cost-cutting initiatives I announced last quarter are well underway, and we're on track to meet or exceed our target of $5.5 billion. We're delivering progress on the number of fronts, including a reduction in streaming operating losses this quarter, and I'm very optimistic about our direct to consumer business longer-term. Combined, our brands, franchises, and robust library are a significant differentiator in the space, and the meteoric subscriber growth we've seen since our launch three years ago only further reinforces that. As I think about our path forward in streaming, we have a number of clear opportunities to further position our DTC business for success. First, as a significant step toward creating a growth business, I'm pleased to announce that we will soon begin offering a one-app experience domestically that incorporates our Hulu content via Disney+. And while we continue to offer Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ as standalone options, this is a logical progression of our DTC offerings that will provide greater opportunities for advertisers while giving bundles of subscribers access to more robust and streamlined content, resulting in greater audience engagement and ultimately leading to a more unified streaming experience. We will begin to roll out this one-app offering by the end of the calendar year, and we look forward to sharing more details in the future. Despite the near-term macro headwinds of the overall marketplace today, the advertising potential of this combined platform is incredibly exciting. And when you drill down into the details, you can see why. Over 40% of our domestic advertising portfolio is addressable, including streaming, which we expect will continue to grow over time. We're also focused on the growth opportunity in programmatic advertising, and we are well positioned to scale as the market improves and audiences continue to grow. We've added more than 1,000 advertisers over the past year, and now have 5,000 advertisers across our streaming platforms, with over a third buying advertising programmatically today. In addition, we plan to launch our ad tier on Disney+ in Europe by the end of this calendar year, which will drive both increased inventory and revenue over the long-term. The truth is we have only just begun to scratch the surface of what we can do with advertising on Disney+. And I'm incredibly bullish on our longer term advertising positioning. Meanwhile, the pricing changes we've already implemented have proven successful and we plan to set a higher price for our ad-free tier later this year to better reflect the value of our content offerings. As we look to the future, we will continue optimizing our pricing model to reward loyalty and reduce churn, to increase subscriber revenue for the premium ad-free tier, and drive growth of subscribers who opt for the lower cost ad-supported option. Additionally, I'd like to share a few other key areas where we see opportunities for improvements in our streaming business. First, it's critical we rationalize the volume of content we're creating and what we're spending to produce our content. Second, our legacy platforms enable us to expand our audiences and often augment our potential streaming success while at the same time allowing us to amortize our content costs across multiple windows. We also need to strike the right balance between our local and global programming as well as our platform and program marketing. Finally, we must continue calibrating our investments in specific markets, looking at the total addressable market and ARPU prospects and evaluating the profitability potential. All of these factors combined are why we are confident that we're on the right path for streaming's long-term profitability. The strength of our content, the one-app experience, and the enormous advertising potential that comes with it, rationalizing the volume of the content we make and what we're spending, maximizing windowing opportunities, recalibrating our investments internationally, perfecting our pricing model, and consolidating our global streaming business under the leadership of Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman, Alan Bergman and Dana Walden. We're doing the essential work now to position our streaming business for sustained growth and success in the future. Turning to our parks, we see this business as a key growth driver for the company. This past quarter, we've been especially pleased with the performance of our parks internationally. We have several international expansions underway that will allow our parks to continue to build capacity and drive longer-term growth. At Disneyland Paris, our Avengers Campus has been a resounding success in its first year. And we have on-going investment underway there, including a Frozen-inspired land currently in development. Our Zootopia-inspired expansion opens later this year at Shanghai Disney Resort. Arendelle, the World of Frozen expansion, is set to open at Hong Kong Disneyland in the second half of 2023. And Tokyo Disney Resort, which is currently celebrating its 40th anniversary, will be opening the new Frozen Kingdom, Rapunzel's Forest, and Peter Pan's Neverland in the coming year. Regarding our domestic parks, we just announced additional changes coming in 2024 that will improve the experience for guests visiting Walt Disney World, including further expanding access for annual pass holders to visit on certain days without reservations, as well as removing the need for an additional reservation for guests with date-based tickets. This is just another example of how we're continuously listening to our guests and finding ways to improve their experiences. And we have a number of other growth and expansion opportunities at our parks and we're closely evaluating where it makes the most sense to direct future investments. The unyielding popularity of our world-class parks business and our unparalleled content, powered by our brands and franchises, is what sets Disney apart. From the very beginning, 100 years ago, our timeless stories and characters have been the key to our success and hold a special place in the hearts of generations of fans and families. We're leaning into this across every segment of our business, as illustrated with our strong summer slate of theatrical releases, including Disney's The Little Mermaid, Pixar's Elemental, and Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny. As we've been looking at the structure of the company these past several months, what's become clear is that there is an enormous opportunity to harness our full potential by increasing alignment and coordination in marketing across our businesses. That's why I named Asad Ayaz our first ever Chief Brand Officer in addition to his role as President of Marketing for our studios. For years, our businesses have been incredibly successful in marketing our content, experiences, and products. And now with greater integration of our touch points with consumers, especially streaming, we're able to be more efficient and more successful in reaching the right audiences with the right offerings from across our businesses. Disney means so much to so many people around the world. That's a privilege we take seriously. And I know I speak for our terrific Chairman, Alan, Dana, Jimmy and Josh, when I say that our goal is to continue finding innovative new ways that allow guests and audiences to have even deeper connections with us. And that's why I'm so thrilled to be taking this more proactive approach to our brand and marketing work. With that, I will turn things over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items, fiscal second quarter, diluted earnings per share, or $0.93, a decrease of $0.15 versus the prior year. As improvements that deep up and direct to consumer, we're more than offset by declines at our linear network's business. As Bob mentioned, we are making excellent progress on our cost-cutting initiatives and are on track to meet or exceed the efficiency targets we outlined last quarter. During Q2, we took a restructuring charge over approximately $150 million, primarily related to severance. While we are continuing to refine our estimates, we currently expect to record additional severance charges of approximately $180 million over the remainder of this fiscal year with the bulk of that additional charge expected in the third quarter. We are in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation that you've heard Bob discuss. As a result, we will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms and currently expect to take an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 billion. The charge, which will not be recorded in our segment results, will primarily be recognized in the third quarter as we complete our review and remove the content. And going forward, we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift. Now, to dive into our quarterly results by segment, starting with our Media and Entertainment Distribution Business, a year-over-year decline in operating income was driven primarily by a $1 billion decrease at linear networks. DTC results improved versus a prior year in content sales licensing and other operating results in the second quarter declined modestly. At linear networks, results were consistent with guidance given last quarter, driven by decreases of approximately $800 million at our domestic linear networks and $160 million at our international linear networks. The domestic results decreased at both cable and broadcasting. At cable, this is largely due to higher sports programming and production costs, which were driven by the timing of costs for the college football playoff and the NFL we discussed last quarter. In addition to NBA contractual rate increases and higher sports production costs. Lower broadcasting results reflected decreases in advertising revenue across the ABC network and our own television stations. Second quarter domestic linear networks affiliate revenue decreased by 2% from the prior year, driven by a 6 point decline from fewer subscribers, partially offset by 3 points of growth from contractual rating increases. Rate growth was adversely impacted by 1 percentage point from the timing of revenue recognition from certain non-owned TV stations. Second quarter, domestic linear advertising revenue declined 10% year-over-year, although ESPN ad revenue is up 2% or flat when adjusted for certain non-comparable items, including CFP timing. The sports advertising marketplace is currently stable, with quarter-to-date ESPN domestic linear cash ads sales pacing up. However, the overall entertainment advertising marketplace has been challenging. While the weakness has moderated somewhat, we anticipate that some softness may continue into the back half of the fiscal year. But as Bob mentioned, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to be a leader in advertising throughout the business cycle, particularly as it relates to our capabilities in addressable and programmatic. And we look forward to sharing more details at our upfront presentation next week. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower advertising revenue, partially offset by lower programming costs. Moving on to the direct-to-consumer, operating losses improved sequentially by approximately $400 million versus Q1. During the second quarter, Disney+ core subscribers grew modestly, with over 600,000 net additions. Core international subs, increased by close to $1 million. While domestic subs declined slightly in the quarter from continued impacts from the price increase, domestic ARPU increased sequentially by 20%, reflecting strong subscription revenue growth. And while the softness we saw in Q2 domestic Disney+ net ads may linger into Q3, we do expect core sub growth to rebound in Q4. At ESPN Plus and Hulu, subscribers increased slightly over the prior quarter. ARPU at Hulu was impacted by lower per-subscriber advertising revenue, in line with the comments we made last quarter regarding near-term softness in the addressable advertising space. DTC expenses, including programming and production costs, and SG&A, declined in the second quarter versus Q1. Our direct-to-consumer operating results in Q2 outperformed our guidance by about $200 million, due in part to timing shifts of marketing expenses driven by recent slate changes at Disney+ and Hulu. The shift of some of those costs into the third quarter will contribute to Q3 DTC operating losses widening by approximately $100 million versus Q2. As we have noted before, the path will not be linear, as the strategic changes and improvements we're executing on take time to deliver, but we remain confident in our long-term trajectory, with continued opportunities to further improve results given our content duration strategy, planned price increases, expanding our relationships with our advertisers, and our on-going disciplined approach to costs. At Content Sales Licensing and Other, we generated a $50 million loss in the quarter, a bit shy of our prior guidance that results would be roughly break-even. Lower results in the second quarter versus the prior year were due to a decrease in TVS mod distribution results, partially offset by improved theatrical distribution results due to the continued success of Avatar, The Way of Water. In the fiscal third quarter, we anticipate this business's operating results will decline by $150 million to $200 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by timing of the marketing of theatrical releases, with key titles, Elemental, In Indiana Jones, and The Dial of Destiny, not premiering until very late in the quarter. Moving on to Parks, Experiences, and Products, operating income increased by over 20% versus the prior year to $2.2 billion, with increases at both international and domestic parks and experiences partially offset by lower merchandise licensing results at consumer products. Our international parks were a bright spot this quarter, with strong year-over-year operating income growth driven by higher attendance and improved financial results at Shanghai Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. At domestic parks and experiences, operating income increased 10% versus the prior year, driven primarily by the continued post-pandemic recovery of our cruise line, partially offset by a comparison to a gain from a real estate sale in the prior year. Q2 domestic parks operating income came in slightly below the prior year, but was still up over 50% versus 2019. Results generally reflects the cost pressures we cited in last quarter's earnings call, including wage increases, costs associated with new guest offerings, and other inflationary cost impacts. Domestic year-over-year increases in attendance and per capita spending were 7% and 2%, respectively. Per-cap growth was more moderate this quarter, as we are comparing against the first full quarter of offering GeniePlus and Lightning Lane at both parks in the prior year. Domestic parks and experiences operating margins were comparable to the prior year, once adjusted for the impact of the prior year's real estate sale. Please keep in mind that in the back half of this fiscal year, there will be an unfavorable comparison against the prior year's incredibly successful 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World. We typically see some moderation in demand as we lapse these types of events, and third quarter-to-date performance has been in line with those historical trends. This comparison, coupled with inflationary cost pressures, including from a new union agreement, is expected to drive a modest adverse impact to domestic parks and experiences operating margins in the third quarter compared to the prior year. However, we expect the contribution from continued strong performance at our international parks in Q3 to result in DPEP segment-level operating margins that are slightly higher than the prior year. DPEP will continue to be a growth business for our company, and we will manage all of these factors in line with our enduring focus on our guests. Before we conclude, I would like to note a couple of items related to our expectations for the total company this year. For fiscal 2023, cash content spend company-wide is expected to remain roughly comparable to last year, excluding any potential impacts from the writer strike, and we expect that fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will total approximately $5.6 billion. This is lower than our prior guide of $6 billion, largely due to timing of projects at DPEP as well as lower technology spend at DMED. We still expect fiscal 2023 revenue and operating income to grow in the high single-digit percentage range. There are still many moving pieces, including macroeconomic factors, the state of the global advertising market, and content timing shifts, which could impact our plans and expectations for the back half of this year. But as Bob mentioned earlier, we are incredibly optimistic about the long-term value creation opportunities that the changes we are currently executing on can generate for our company, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. And with that, I will turn the call over to Alexia for Q&A.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Christine. As we transition to Q&A, we ask you to please try to limit yourselves to one question in order to help us get as many answers as possible today. And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good afternoon. Bob, I wanted to ask you about what you learned on sort of two topics over the last several months. One is around the price increase on Disney+. You've sort of commented that you think it went well. Obviously, we can see the subscriber trends. And you sound optimistic that the company can continue to drive ARPU over time. Maybe you just talk a little bit about what you've seen in the customer base and reaction and engagement that gives you confidence around pricing power for Disney+ looking ahead. And then a similar question around the cost rationalization and reorg at the company, now that you're sort of deep into that. What have you learned about the opportunity for that to drive better financial results for the company? And Christine sort of teased it, that there might be more opportunities to maybe exceed expectations. But do you think there's more to do, I guess, is the short question on the cost side. Thank you very much.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Ben. On the first question regarding price increases, first, we were pleasantly surprised that the loss of subs due to what was a substantial increase in pricing for the non-ad supported Disney+ product was de minimis. It was some loss, but it was relatively small. That leads us to believe that we, in fact, have pricing elasticity. With that in mind, I think one of the things that we not only have discovered, but that we believe we have to do, is that we've got to widen the delta between the ad-free service and the non-ad supported service. Because we clearly would like to drive more subs to the ad-supported service, which we did in the quarter, by the way, the obvious reason, because of the ARPU potential of the ad service Disney+. And in fact, as we look to this up front and after careful and considerable discussion with our sales team, led by Rita Farrow, we see that there's going to be a substantial growth in digital advertising in this up front, I mean, quite substantial. Suggesting, for the obvious reason, because digital advertising is so attractive to advertisers, that there's an opportunity for us to really lean into ad-supported. And again, raising our prices on the ad-free, keeping the prices on the ad-supported relatively modest, maybe perhaps no increases, increasing the delta, driving more subs in a higher ARPU direction. So we're heartened by it, and we are optimistic. And that is one of the strategies that we believe will help lead us ultimately to profitability and growth, along with the second thing that you mentioned, which is the cost rationalization. And I'll tag team with Christine on this. Clearly, we, as she mentioned, we're on a path to meeting or exceeding $5.5 billion in growth, sorry, in cost reductions that we mentioned last quarter. That comes in two categories, content spend and SG&A. I'm going to let Christine handle the SG&A. But on the content spend, we said at the time, most of that will come starting in 2024 and into 2025, because we were committed to so much content already in 2023. I'll let Christine handle the timing of the SG&A reductions and what potential impact that would have. Clearly, again, the price increases, the pushing more viewers, sorry, more subscribers to the ad-supported, and the cost containment are among the things we are doing to get to profitability.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. Hi, Ben. I'll just further elaborate on some of the SG&A progress that we've had. And thanks for picking up that I did tease that by saying that we would need to exceed our targets of $2.5 billion. But, as we've gotten into this, there's been great cooperation throughout the entire company, which has been really rewarding, because we're looking at this and, of course, there's the reality of headcount reductions, and we're going through those. But there's also other things that we're finding more and more opportunities on eliminating redundancies, looking at ways to become more effective by utilizing resources, people and other resources across other businesses. But we're really leaning into all the opportunities. There's technology, which we've also seen a lot of good progress. Some of it will be, and I say some, will be realized in the balance of this year, really at the end of the fiscal year. But the real impact is going to help us in 2024. But, once again, since we're all into it, I think, once again, having it be company-wide and having, it be something that all of our business leaders have embraced, we are looking for a real comprehensive look throughout the SG&A buckets.\nRobert Iger: And one more thing to add to that, Ben. We launched Disney+ in many, many markets around the world, including many very low ARPU markets. And not only did we launch in those markets, but we spent a lot of money on marketing in those markets, and we spent money on local content. So, as we rationalize this business and we head in the direction of profitability, clearly, we're looking at opportunities to reduce expenses in those markets where the revenue potential just isn't there.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Thank you both.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi. Great to see the park's doing so well. Christine, can you dig into the contribution from Shanghai and where that is relative pre-COVID and to its potential? And Bob, Florida is such a big part of the value of the company, but you have this political issue that only seems to get more press. It seems like you're stuck with this fight. So, how should investors think about the risk, both the near-term and long-term business for Disney? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Phil. Yes, let me address our results at Shanghai. They were incredibly positive this quarter. We've been really gratified to see the bounce back from the pandemic closures that we had. We're not going to get into too many specifics, but suffice it to say that the business is doing extremely well on both an attendance and a per-cap basis. We see that momentum continuing, and we also have some new attractions. We've talked about Zootopia coming later this year, and we believe that that is going to drive even further attendance and spending at the park. But Shanghai is doing extremely well, and we've been really gratified to see that bounce back. Like I said, it was closed for quite a long period of time during the pandemic.\nRobert Iger: Regarding Florida, I got a few things I want to say about that, Phil. First of all, I think the case that we filed last month made our position in the facts very clear, and that's really that this is about one thing and one thing only, and that's retaliating against us for taking a position about pending legislation. And we believe that in us taking that position, we are merely exercising our right to free speech. Also, this is not about special privileges or a level playing field or Disney in any way using its leverage around the state of Florida. But since there's been a lot said about special districts and the arrangement that we had, I want to set the record straight on that, too. There are about 2,000 special districts in Florida, and most were established to foster investment and development, where we were one of them. It basically made it easier for us and others, by the way, to do business in Florida, and we built a business that employs, as we've said before, over 75,000 people and attracts tens of millions of people to the state. So while it's easy to say that the Reedy Creek Special District that was established for us over 50 years ago benefited us, it's misleading to not also consider how much Disney benefited the state of Florida. And we're also, we're not the only company operating a special district. I mentioned 2000, the Daytona Speedway has one, so do the Villages, which is a prominent retirement community, and there are countless others. So the goal here is leveling the playing, if the goal is leveling the playing field, then a uniform application of the law or government oversight of special districts needs to occur or be applied to all special districts. There's also a false narrative that we've been fighting to protect tax breaks as part of this, but in fact, we're the largest taxpayer in central Florida, paying over 1.1 billion in state and local taxes last year alone, and we pay more taxes, specifically more real estate taxes, as a result of that special district. And we all know there was no concerted effort to do anything to dismantle what was once called Reedy Creek Special District until we spoke out on the legislation. So this is plainly a matter of retaliation while the rest of the Florida special districts continue operating basically as they were. And I think it's also important for us to say our primary goal has always been to be able to continue to do exactly what we've been doing there, which is investing in Florida. We're proud of the tourism industry that we created, and we want to continue delivering the best possible experience for guests going forward. We never wanted, and we certainly never expected, to be in the position of having to defend our business interests in federal court, particularly having such a terrific relationship with the state, as we've had for more than 50 years. And as I mentioned on our shareholder call, we have a huge opportunity to continue to invest in Florida. I noted that our plans were to invest $17 billion over the next ten years, which is what the state should want us to do. We operate responsibly, we pay our fair share of taxes, we employ thousands of people, and by the way, we pay them above the minimum wage, substantially above the minimum wage dictated by the state of Florida. And we also provide them with great benefits and free education. So I'm going to finish what is obviously kind of a long answer by asking one question. Does the state want us to invest more, employ more people, and pay more taxes, or not? Thanks.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks, Bob.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I have two. Bob, first for you is, what do you think the impact of the slowdown in your DTC content spending will have on global subscriber growth, and then what does the move to one app in the U.S. offer as a solution? And Christine, any help on future cash content spending? You said this year is flat. Is this the peak year, and then we start seeing declines from this year? Any help there on future cash content spending will be helpful. Thanks.\nRobert Iger: Michael, when we launch this service, let me remind everyone, it was only three and a half years ago, so we're still a startup in many ways. The goal was, as you know, global subs, and we wanted to flood the so-called digital shelves with as much content as possible. To achieve, obviously, as much sub growth as possible. And now, as we grow the business in terms of the global footprint, we realize that we made a lot of content that is not necessarily driving sub growth, and we're getting much more surgical about what it is we make. So, as we look to reduce content spend, we're looking to reduce it in a way that should not have any impact at all on subs. We believe that there's an opportunity for us to focus more on real sub drivers. And one interesting example and I should also throw marketing in, too, where when you make a lot of content, everything needs to be marketed. You're spending a lot of money marketing things that are not going to have an impact on the bottom line, except negatively, due to the marketing costs. One thing we also know is that our films, those that are released theatrically, big tentpole movies in particular, are great sub drivers. But we were spreading our marketing costs so thin that we were not allocating enough money to even market them when they came on the service, as witnessed by the ones that are coming up, including Avatar, Little Mermaid, Guardians of the Galaxy, Indiana Jones, Elemental, etcetera, where we actually believe we have an opportunity to lean into those more, put the right marketing dollars against it, allocate more from basically away from programming that was not driving any subs at all. So, I guess this is part of the maturation process. As we grow into a business that we had never been in, we're learning a lot more about it. Specifically, we're learning a lot more about how our content behaves on the service, and what it is consumers want.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Michael. I'll address your question on content spend. As you know, this is an area that Bob is spending a lot of time working with our creative teams on. But when you think about that $30 billion overall, and Bob's targeted an annualized saving in the $3 billion range, I just want to remind everyone that the sports component of that amount is now over 30%, just due to the contractual rate increases that we've had in our contract rights, our sports rights. The other thing is, in fiscal 2023, we said that we're going to be roughly comparable to last year. Remember, last year we came in slightly below $30 billion. And this estimate does not include any potential impacts from the writer's strike. We have not estimated that, because that's a new development, and we haven't really quantified what that would be, because we don't know how long it's going to last. But in general, what we're really doing is looking at a lower volume of content, as I mentioned in my comments. And Bob is, once again, going through all of the development slates, and really looking at not only our Disney-branded, but also a more curated approach to our general entertainment content.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Bob, you mentioned that in the upfront, you will take a bigger share. You'll lean heavily into digital or AVOD. I'm just wondering, in the face of accelerating pay-to-view universe decline, is that enough to offset linear losses, or when will it be enough to offset linear losses and start to drive growth? And in the sub-universe decline thought, I'm just wondering if you can give us your thoughts on ESPN and how it transitions, or when it transitions to ESPN Plus.\nRobert Iger: I'll address the ESPN first. We haven't really changed our position regarding basically migrating ESPN's flagship service as a direct-to-consumer or streaming platform. We think there's an inevitability to that, but it's a huge decision for us to make, and we know that we've got to get it right, both in terms of pricing and timing. Obviously, that has not only a direct impact on the linear channels, but it will have an even greater impact on it if we were to do that. What we see going on in linear networks, as you know, I'm not saying anything that you don't know, is we're seeing both sub-declines and advertising weakness. And it's created worrisome circumstance for us, because it's obviously having such a negative impact on the economics of that business, and that's forcing us to take a look at the cost structure of those channels, which ultimately comes down, probably more than anything, to spending on programming. The decline in the business is, by the way, something that we predicted starting in 2015-16, which is why we got into the streaming business to begin with, but the declines that we're seeing put even more pressure on us to turn that streaming business into a profitable growth business for us, and that's why all of the steps that we're taking, both in terms of the organizational structure, the cost reductions, the marketing changes, the changes in how we program, the lean into advertising, we've also, by the way, Jessica, we've invested a fair amount in the technology needed to serve advertisers digitally much more effectively with automated sales functionality and delivering in a very, very granular way exactly what advertisers want. So we're very bullish about leaning into digital advertising. We're bullish about how we're positioned there. We're bullish about Disney+ and Hulu and that combination, by the way. We think that by making Hulu available as a one-app experience will increase our engagement and increase our opportunity in terms of serving digital ads and growing our advertising business. So all things are kind of connected, ESPN to the long-term health of the bundle, the growth and the need to grow streaming as a reaction to the deterioration of linear businesses and, of course, all the steps that we've been taking to get to profitability.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Bob, on Hulu, the revenues of Hulu make it one of the biggest streaming businesses around, and it's also one of the oldest services around, but it doesn't seem to be profitable despite the scale. And it sounds like you've made up your mind on buying the rest of Hulu based on the announcement of the combination with Disney+. Does this combination allow you to change the cost structure of Hulu by maybe dropping content spending or the number of titles on Hulu and raising price because it's now a single service? So any color on your plans with Hulu would be much appreciated. And, Christine, on the parks, could you help us scale the impact of the recent wage increases in Florida and how that might impact the year? And, historically, the business has delivered mid-single digits for better revenue growth, and EBITDA grows faster than that. You now have a number of cruise ships, more attractions, higher price, but also higher costs. So could you help us think about the growth algorithm going forward more broadly? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Kannan, as you know, we have a contractual arrangement with Comcast that will enable them to put their share of Hulu back to us in early 2024. Starting in early 2024, there's a, I guess, further right that we have to call their share from them. And it's not really been fully determined what will happen in that regard, except that as we look more and more at the growth or the future of our streaming business, and I mentioned at the first earnings call that I did after I came back that everything was on the table. And, in fact, everything was on the table. But I've now had another three months to really study this carefully and figure out what is the best path for us to grow this business. And it's clear that a combination of the content that is on Disney+ with general entertainment is a very positive, is a very strong combination. From a subscriber perspective, from a subscriber acquisition, subscriber retention perspective, and also from an advertiser's perspective. So where we are headed is for one experience that would have general entertainment and Disney+ content together for the reasons that I just described. How that ultimately unfolds is to some extent in the hands of Comcast and in the hands of basically a conversation or a negotiation that we have with them. I don't want to be in any way predictive in terms of when or how that ends up. I can say we've had some conversations with them already. They've been cordial and they're aimed at being constructive. But I can't tell you and I can't really say where they end up, only to say that there seems to be real value in having general entertainment combined with Disney+. And if ultimately Hulu is that solution, we're bullish about that.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Kannan. Let me address your question on parks earnings growth and the outlook there. So I think the way I would phrase this is we do expect a really solid year overall for our domestic parks. That being said, we also expect increased costs. And we alluded to that in our first quarter earnings call. And they're really coming from a few areas most predominantly. One is wages with the new union contract coupled with inflationary trends. We do have some new guest offerings. So there's some incremental operating expenses that come along with those. And we also have the operational support for adding a fifth cruise ship to our cruise line fleet. I think you all know that we launched the Wish back last fall. So we continue to look at ways to address cost management. The team down there has done a great job throughout the pandemic and then coming out of the pandemic. But they utilize a variety of tactics to mitigate potential margin pressures and downside risk across the segments. And some of the levers that they can utilize to really address it are by looking at capacity in some of our new attractions, they increase the footprint or increase capacity so we can open up the valve a little bit more on attendance. And with some new attractions that are more based on newer IP, so that will get more people not only coming in but wanting to come in and enjoy the experience while they're there. And we also are really continuing to focus on meeting our customer needs there. But we think that, this is a growth business for us. We've said so in the past. And I do just want to give a call out to our cruise business. That business, as you know, was the most impacted. And we had talked about that, that was going to be the last business to come back from the closures during the pandemic. But that business has come back incredibly strongly over the last year, this fiscal year. And even looking out to the balance of our fiscal year, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there and the reception to not only our new ship but also our legacy ships within the fleet.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Morris of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask one on direct-to-consumer advertising. And I'd love to hear any early details you can share about the Disney+ with advertising product. It wasn't mentioned as a driver, and I realize it's early. But I would love to hear any early takes there and thoughts about how that might pace over the course of the year. And then second, Bob, I'd love to ask about artificial intelligence, clearly a very hot topic right now, and a technology that seems like it could be pretty impactful to your business, both your ability to use it but also just given how much intellectual property you have to protect something that could be a threat as well. So I'd love any takes that you can share on how that would impact the business over time. Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Not to get cheeky, Michael, I'm looking forward to a time where maybe AI does earnings calls for me. You probably wouldn't know the difference, perhaps. Maybe they'd be better. I don't know.\nMichael Morris: I'd use AI to ask the questions, too.\nRobert Iger: It's pretty clear that AI developments represent some pretty interesting opportunities for us and some substantial benefits. In fact, we're already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers. Getting closer to the customer is something that is a real goal of ours, and we think that AI will provide some great opportunities to do that. But it's also clear that AI is going to be highly disruptive, and it could be extremely difficult to manage, particularly from an IP management perspective. I can tell you that our legal team is working overtime already to try to come to grips with what could be some of the challenges here, and we're certainly not the only ones. I think this is across not only our industry but industries. So I'd have to say overall I'm bullish about the prospects because I think they'll create efficiencies and ways for us to basically provide better services to customers. On the other hand, I think that there's a lot we're going to have to contend with that will be quite disruptive and quite challenging. Getting more specific is not something I really am prepared to do right now.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Mike. I will take the Disney+ ad tier question for you. As you know, we launched back in December, and we've just begun to scratch the surface of what we can really do on advertising on Disney+. And we look at this as an incredible opportunity for longer-term advertising positioning. Just to remind everyone, we do have a lighter ad load on Disney+ versus what we have on Hulu and also notwithstanding the very challenging macroeconomic advertising market, we're still seeing our consumers come into the not only existing but also new sign-ups come into that ad tier, so we're very encouraged by that. As Bob has mentioned previously, we have invested a lot in our ad tier technology and our data platforms for really providing state-of-the-art programmatic and addressable ad tools to our advertisers, so those are also investments that we've made and we believe are going to pay off not only today but position us well for the future as the ad market overall gets stronger. The other thing I just want to mention is we will be launching the ad tier on Disney+ in Europe by the end of this calendar year, so that will be another platform that we'll have or another offering that we'll have for consumers outside of the U.S.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: The last question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nOperator:\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Just struck me on good afternoon. Bob, integrating Hulu into the Disney+ app is intriguing, so I wanted to continue that conversation. When Disney+ was launched you noted consumers should not have to buy through your entertainment content to get to Marvel and Star Wars and Disney and Pixar content, and you thought at the time having separate services to give consumers choice was the right approach. Is that still the right approach to have multiple services to give consumer choice? And if the answer is yes but you want the efficiency and flexibility of a single app, that would suggest that Disney+ is finally turning into a platform, and I'm just curious if you see the opportunity to broaden the number of subscriptions that can live on that Disney+ platform or if you can expand the monetization of that platform in other ways while maintaining a premium experience for consumers. And if I could just add one for Christine. Is fiscal 3Q the peak for streaming losses? Thank you both.\nRobert Iger: We -- on the integrated app experience that we announced today, that's for consumers that have subscribed to both services for now. So in other words, it's taking what we call the dual bundle and putting it together in one experience, which is obviously good for consumers. Why have to close out one app and open another one? So it becomes a one app experience. We also think that it will benefit basically consumption in general, lower churn, be more attractive. It's just an all-in-one. It's a bigger platform, basically more content than it offered before. Outside the United States, we created that with Star, which doesn't have all the programming of Hulu, but it has a significant amount and it's working quite well. And it's one of the reasons why we're going to launch that as an advertised supported platform, as Christine mentioned. So I think to answer your question, we're bullish about an app that goes well beyond the Disney+ branded content and includes general entertainment, which maybe at one point I called undifferentiated. That was a little harsh. But that includes quality curated general entertainment for the purpose of growing advertising, growing subscriber fees, growing engagement, growing lessening churn, and to address one part of your question, reducing costs.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Doug. And I'll answer your question on the direct-to-consumer losses and the peak losses. Just to remind everyone, we did say, and it is the case, that we had peak losses in direct-to-consumer in the fourth quarter of 2022. That was the quarter that we reported in November. So what you've seen since then is we improved on a sequential, linked-quarter basis. You've seen a $400 million improvement in Q1, another $400 million improvement in Q2. In my comments, I did say that Q3, it would widen out by $100 million because of the timing of some releases and particularly the marketing of those releases. But that will be an aberration because it's not a linear path, but we will be improving significantly from 22 peak losses in Q4 through the balance of fiscal 2023. So, you should assume that what you saw back in Q4 was the peak loss and we have improved for the next two quarters, there will be that one little blip in Q3 and then we expect to be back on the path for the balance of the fiscal year.\nDoug Mitchelson: Very helpful.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay, thanks for the question.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Iger",
            "content": "Thank you Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Allow me to digress for a moment to congratulate Universal for the tremendous success of Super Mario Brothers. It certainly proves people love to be entertained in theatres around the world and it gives us reason to be optimistic about the movie business. Now turning to our results. We're pleased with our accomplishments this quarter, which are reflective of the strategic changes we've been making throughout our businesses. We're also proud of what we continue to deliver for consumers, from movies to television to sports, news and our theme parks. A few recent highlights include Marvel Studios Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, which topped the global box office in its opening weekend with $289 million. The first round of the NBA playoffs was the most watched ever across Disney networks, and we've been averaging 5 million viewers throughout the first 22 games, up 15% versus the comparable point in last year's playoffs. ABC continued its run as the number one entertainment broadcast network for the fourth consecutive season. And at our domestic parks, we continued to improve the guest experience with our recent pricing changes and exciting new attractions, including the Reimagined Mickey's Toontown at Disneyland and TRON Lightcycle Run at Walt Disney World. I've been back at the company for almost six months, and in that time we've embarked on a significant transformation to strategically realign Disney for sustained growth and success. I'm pleased to say that the strategy we detailed last quarter is working. Our new organizational structure is returning authority and accountability to our creative leaders, as well as allowing for a more efficient, coordinated, and streamlined approach to our operations. The cost-cutting initiatives I announced last quarter are well underway, and we're on track to meet or exceed our target of $5.5 billion. We're delivering progress on the number of fronts, including a reduction in streaming operating losses this quarter, and I'm very optimistic about our direct to consumer business longer-term. Combined, our brands, franchises, and robust library are a significant differentiator in the space, and the meteoric subscriber growth we've seen since our launch three years ago only further reinforces that. As I think about our path forward in streaming, we have a number of clear opportunities to further position our DTC business for success. First, as a significant step toward creating a growth business, I'm pleased to announce that we will soon begin offering a one-app experience domestically that incorporates our Hulu content via Disney+. And while we continue to offer Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ as standalone options, this is a logical progression of our DTC offerings that will provide greater opportunities for advertisers while giving bundles of subscribers access to more robust and streamlined content, resulting in greater audience engagement and ultimately leading to a more unified streaming experience. We will begin to roll out this one-app offering by the end of the calendar year, and we look forward to sharing more details in the future. Despite the near-term macro headwinds of the overall marketplace today, the advertising potential of this combined platform is incredibly exciting. And when you drill down into the details, you can see why. Over 40% of our domestic advertising portfolio is addressable, including streaming, which we expect will continue to grow over time. We're also focused on the growth opportunity in programmatic advertising, and we are well positioned to scale as the market improves and audiences continue to grow. We've added more than 1,000 advertisers over the past year, and now have 5,000 advertisers across our streaming platforms, with over a third buying advertising programmatically today. In addition, we plan to launch our ad tier on Disney+ in Europe by the end of this calendar year, which will drive both increased inventory and revenue over the long-term. The truth is we have only just begun to scratch the surface of what we can do with advertising on Disney+. And I'm incredibly bullish on our longer term advertising positioning. Meanwhile, the pricing changes we've already implemented have proven successful and we plan to set a higher price for our ad-free tier later this year to better reflect the value of our content offerings. As we look to the future, we will continue optimizing our pricing model to reward loyalty and reduce churn, to increase subscriber revenue for the premium ad-free tier, and drive growth of subscribers who opt for the lower cost ad-supported option. Additionally, I'd like to share a few other key areas where we see opportunities for improvements in our streaming business. First, it's critical we rationalize the volume of content we're creating and what we're spending to produce our content. Second, our legacy platforms enable us to expand our audiences and often augment our potential streaming success while at the same time allowing us to amortize our content costs across multiple windows. We also need to strike the right balance between our local and global programming as well as our platform and program marketing. Finally, we must continue calibrating our investments in specific markets, looking at the total addressable market and ARPU prospects and evaluating the profitability potential. All of these factors combined are why we are confident that we're on the right path for streaming's long-term profitability. The strength of our content, the one-app experience, and the enormous advertising potential that comes with it, rationalizing the volume of the content we make and what we're spending, maximizing windowing opportunities, recalibrating our investments internationally, perfecting our pricing model, and consolidating our global streaming business under the leadership of Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman, Alan Bergman and Dana Walden. We're doing the essential work now to position our streaming business for sustained growth and success in the future. Turning to our parks, we see this business as a key growth driver for the company. This past quarter, we've been especially pleased with the performance of our parks internationally. We have several international expansions underway that will allow our parks to continue to build capacity and drive longer-term growth. At Disneyland Paris, our Avengers Campus has been a resounding success in its first year. And we have on-going investment underway there, including a Frozen-inspired land currently in development. Our Zootopia-inspired expansion opens later this year at Shanghai Disney Resort. Arendelle, the World of Frozen expansion, is set to open at Hong Kong Disneyland in the second half of 2023. And Tokyo Disney Resort, which is currently celebrating its 40th anniversary, will be opening the new Frozen Kingdom, Rapunzel's Forest, and Peter Pan's Neverland in the coming year. Regarding our domestic parks, we just announced additional changes coming in 2024 that will improve the experience for guests visiting Walt Disney World, including further expanding access for annual pass holders to visit on certain days without reservations, as well as removing the need for an additional reservation for guests with date-based tickets. This is just another example of how we're continuously listening to our guests and finding ways to improve their experiences. And we have a number of other growth and expansion opportunities at our parks and we're closely evaluating where it makes the most sense to direct future investments. The unyielding popularity of our world-class parks business and our unparalleled content, powered by our brands and franchises, is what sets Disney apart. From the very beginning, 100 years ago, our timeless stories and characters have been the key to our success and hold a special place in the hearts of generations of fans and families. We're leaning into this across every segment of our business, as illustrated with our strong summer slate of theatrical releases, including Disney's The Little Mermaid, Pixar's Elemental, and Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny. As we've been looking at the structure of the company these past several months, what's become clear is that there is an enormous opportunity to harness our full potential by increasing alignment and coordination in marketing across our businesses. That's why I named Asad Ayaz our first ever Chief Brand Officer in addition to his role as President of Marketing for our studios. For years, our businesses have been incredibly successful in marketing our content, experiences, and products. And now with greater integration of our touch points with consumers, especially streaming, we're able to be more efficient and more successful in reaching the right audiences with the right offerings from across our businesses. Disney means so much to so many people around the world. That's a privilege we take seriously. And I know I speak for our terrific Chairman, Alan, Dana, Jimmy and Josh, when I say that our goal is to continue finding innovative new ways that allow guests and audiences to have even deeper connections with us. And that's why I'm so thrilled to be taking this more proactive approach to our brand and marketing work. With that, I will turn things over to Christine. Thanks, Ben. On the first question regarding price increases, first, we were pleasantly surprised that the loss of subs due to what was a substantial increase in pricing for the non-ad supported Disney+ product was de minimis. It was some loss, but it was relatively small. That leads us to believe that we, in fact, have pricing elasticity. With that in mind, I think one of the things that we not only have discovered, but that we believe we have to do, is that we've got to widen the delta between the ad-free service and the non-ad supported service. Because we clearly would like to drive more subs to the ad-supported service, which we did in the quarter, by the way, the obvious reason, because of the ARPU potential of the ad service Disney+. And in fact, as we look to this up front and after careful and considerable discussion with our sales team, led by Rita Farrow, we see that there's going to be a substantial growth in digital advertising in this up front, I mean, quite substantial. Suggesting, for the obvious reason, because digital advertising is so attractive to advertisers, that there's an opportunity for us to really lean into ad-supported. And again, raising our prices on the ad-free, keeping the prices on the ad-supported relatively modest, maybe perhaps no increases, increasing the delta, driving more subs in a higher ARPU direction. So we're heartened by it, and we are optimistic. And that is one of the strategies that we believe will help lead us ultimately to profitability and growth, along with the second thing that you mentioned, which is the cost rationalization. And I'll tag team with Christine on this. Clearly, we, as she mentioned, we're on a path to meeting or exceeding $5.5 billion in growth, sorry, in cost reductions that we mentioned last quarter. That comes in two categories, content spend and SG&A. I'm going to let Christine handle the SG&A. But on the content spend, we said at the time, most of that will come starting in 2024 and into 2025, because we were committed to so much content already in 2023. I'll let Christine handle the timing of the SG&A reductions and what potential impact that would have. Clearly, again, the price increases, the pushing more viewers, sorry, more subscribers to the ad-supported, and the cost containment are among the things we are doing to get to profitability. And one more thing to add to that, Ben. We launched Disney+ in many, many markets around the world, including many very low ARPU markets. And not only did we launch in those markets, but we spent a lot of money on marketing in those markets, and we spent money on local content. So, as we rationalize this business and we head in the direction of profitability, clearly, we're looking at opportunities to reduce expenses in those markets where the revenue potential just isn't there. Regarding Florida, I got a few things I want to say about that, Phil. First of all, I think the case that we filed last month made our position in the facts very clear, and that's really that this is about one thing and one thing only, and that's retaliating against us for taking a position about pending legislation. And we believe that in us taking that position, we are merely exercising our right to free speech. Also, this is not about special privileges or a level playing field or Disney in any way using its leverage around the state of Florida. But since there's been a lot said about special districts and the arrangement that we had, I want to set the record straight on that, too. There are about 2,000 special districts in Florida, and most were established to foster investment and development, where we were one of them. It basically made it easier for us and others, by the way, to do business in Florida, and we built a business that employs, as we've said before, over 75,000 people and attracts tens of millions of people to the state. So while it's easy to say that the Reedy Creek Special District that was established for us over 50 years ago benefited us, it's misleading to not also consider how much Disney benefited the state of Florida. And we're also, we're not the only company operating a special district. I mentioned 2000, the Daytona Speedway has one, so do the Villages, which is a prominent retirement community, and there are countless others. So the goal here is leveling the playing, if the goal is leveling the playing field, then a uniform application of the law or government oversight of special districts needs to occur or be applied to all special districts. There's also a false narrative that we've been fighting to protect tax breaks as part of this, but in fact, we're the largest taxpayer in central Florida, paying over 1.1 billion in state and local taxes last year alone, and we pay more taxes, specifically more real estate taxes, as a result of that special district. And we all know there was no concerted effort to do anything to dismantle what was once called Reedy Creek Special District until we spoke out on the legislation. So this is plainly a matter of retaliation while the rest of the Florida special districts continue operating basically as they were. And I think it's also important for us to say our primary goal has always been to be able to continue to do exactly what we've been doing there, which is investing in Florida. We're proud of the tourism industry that we created, and we want to continue delivering the best possible experience for guests going forward. We never wanted, and we certainly never expected, to be in the position of having to defend our business interests in federal court, particularly having such a terrific relationship with the state, as we've had for more than 50 years. And as I mentioned on our shareholder call, we have a huge opportunity to continue to invest in Florida. I noted that our plans were to invest $17 billion over the next ten years, which is what the state should want us to do. We operate responsibly, we pay our fair share of taxes, we employ thousands of people, and by the way, we pay them above the minimum wage, substantially above the minimum wage dictated by the state of Florida. And we also provide them with great benefits and free education. So I'm going to finish what is obviously kind of a long answer by asking one question. Does the state want us to invest more, employ more people, and pay more taxes, or not? Thanks. Michael, when we launch this service, let me remind everyone, it was only three and a half years ago, so we're still a startup in many ways. The goal was, as you know, global subs, and we wanted to flood the so-called digital shelves with as much content as possible. To achieve, obviously, as much sub growth as possible. And now, as we grow the business in terms of the global footprint, we realize that we made a lot of content that is not necessarily driving sub growth, and we're getting much more surgical about what it is we make. So, as we look to reduce content spend, we're looking to reduce it in a way that should not have any impact at all on subs. We believe that there's an opportunity for us to focus more on real sub drivers. And one interesting example and I should also throw marketing in, too, where when you make a lot of content, everything needs to be marketed. You're spending a lot of money marketing things that are not going to have an impact on the bottom line, except negatively, due to the marketing costs. One thing we also know is that our films, those that are released theatrically, big tentpole movies in particular, are great sub drivers. But we were spreading our marketing costs so thin that we were not allocating enough money to even market them when they came on the service, as witnessed by the ones that are coming up, including Avatar, Little Mermaid, Guardians of the Galaxy, Indiana Jones, Elemental, etcetera, where we actually believe we have an opportunity to lean into those more, put the right marketing dollars against it, allocate more from basically away from programming that was not driving any subs at all. So, I guess this is part of the maturation process. As we grow into a business that we had never been in, we're learning a lot more about it. Specifically, we're learning a lot more about how our content behaves on the service, and what it is consumers want. I'll address the ESPN first. We haven't really changed our position regarding basically migrating ESPN's flagship service as a direct-to-consumer or streaming platform. We think there's an inevitability to that, but it's a huge decision for us to make, and we know that we've got to get it right, both in terms of pricing and timing. Obviously, that has not only a direct impact on the linear channels, but it will have an even greater impact on it if we were to do that. What we see going on in linear networks, as you know, I'm not saying anything that you don't know, is we're seeing both sub-declines and advertising weakness. And it's created worrisome circumstance for us, because it's obviously having such a negative impact on the economics of that business, and that's forcing us to take a look at the cost structure of those channels, which ultimately comes down, probably more than anything, to spending on programming. The decline in the business is, by the way, something that we predicted starting in 2015-16, which is why we got into the streaming business to begin with, but the declines that we're seeing put even more pressure on us to turn that streaming business into a profitable growth business for us, and that's why all of the steps that we're taking, both in terms of the organizational structure, the cost reductions, the marketing changes, the changes in how we program, the lean into advertising, we've also, by the way, Jessica, we've invested a fair amount in the technology needed to serve advertisers digitally much more effectively with automated sales functionality and delivering in a very, very granular way exactly what advertisers want. So we're very bullish about leaning into digital advertising. We're bullish about how we're positioned there. We're bullish about Disney+ and Hulu and that combination, by the way. We think that by making Hulu available as a one-app experience will increase our engagement and increase our opportunity in terms of serving digital ads and growing our advertising business. So all things are kind of connected, ESPN to the long-term health of the bundle, the growth and the need to grow streaming as a reaction to the deterioration of linear businesses and, of course, all the steps that we've been taking to get to profitability. Kannan, as you know, we have a contractual arrangement with Comcast that will enable them to put their share of Hulu back to us in early 2024. Starting in early 2024, there's a, I guess, further right that we have to call their share from them. And it's not really been fully determined what will happen in that regard, except that as we look more and more at the growth or the future of our streaming business, and I mentioned at the first earnings call that I did after I came back that everything was on the table. And, in fact, everything was on the table. But I've now had another three months to really study this carefully and figure out what is the best path for us to grow this business. And it's clear that a combination of the content that is on Disney+ with general entertainment is a very positive, is a very strong combination. From a subscriber perspective, from a subscriber acquisition, subscriber retention perspective, and also from an advertiser's perspective. So where we are headed is for one experience that would have general entertainment and Disney+ content together for the reasons that I just described. How that ultimately unfolds is to some extent in the hands of Comcast and in the hands of basically a conversation or a negotiation that we have with them. I don't want to be in any way predictive in terms of when or how that ends up. I can say we've had some conversations with them already. They've been cordial and they're aimed at being constructive. But I can't tell you and I can't really say where they end up, only to say that there seems to be real value in having general entertainment combined with Disney+. And if ultimately Hulu is that solution, we're bullish about that. Not to get cheeky, Michael, I'm looking forward to a time where maybe AI does earnings calls for me. You probably wouldn't know the difference, perhaps. Maybe they'd be better. I don't know. It's pretty clear that AI developments represent some pretty interesting opportunities for us and some substantial benefits. In fact, we're already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers. Getting closer to the customer is something that is a real goal of ours, and we think that AI will provide some great opportunities to do that. But it's also clear that AI is going to be highly disruptive, and it could be extremely difficult to manage, particularly from an IP management perspective. I can tell you that our legal team is working overtime already to try to come to grips with what could be some of the challenges here, and we're certainly not the only ones. I think this is across not only our industry but industries. So I'd have to say overall I'm bullish about the prospects because I think they'll create efficiencies and ways for us to basically provide better services to customers. On the other hand, I think that there's a lot we're going to have to contend with that will be quite disruptive and quite challenging. Getting more specific is not something I really am prepared to do right now. We -- on the integrated app experience that we announced today, that's for consumers that have subscribed to both services for now. So in other words, it's taking what we call the dual bundle and putting it together in one experience, which is obviously good for consumers. Why have to close out one app and open another one? So it becomes a one app experience. We also think that it will benefit basically consumption in general, lower churn, be more attractive. It's just an all-in-one. It's a bigger platform, basically more content than it offered before. Outside the United States, we created that with Star, which doesn't have all the programming of Hulu, but it has a significant amount and it's working quite well. And it's one of the reasons why we're going to launch that as an advertised supported platform, as Christine mentioned. So I think to answer your question, we're bullish about an app that goes well beyond the Disney+ branded content and includes general entertainment, which maybe at one point I called undifferentiated. That was a little harsh. But that includes quality curated general entertainment for the purpose of growing advertising, growing subscriber fees, growing engagement, growing lessening churn, and to address one part of your question, reducing costs."

            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items, fiscal second quarter, diluted earnings per share, or $0.93, a decrease of $0.15 versus the prior year. As improvements that deep up and direct to consumer, we're more than offset by declines at our linear network's business. As Bob mentioned, we are making excellent progress on our cost-cutting initiatives and are on track to meet or exceed the efficiency targets we outlined last quarter. During Q2, we took a restructuring charge over approximately $150 million, primarily related to severance. While we are continuing to refine our estimates, we currently expect to record additional severance charges of approximately $180 million over the remainder of this fiscal year with the bulk of that additional charge expected in the third quarter. We are in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation that you've heard Bob discuss. As a result, we will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms and currently expect to take an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 billion. The charge, which will not be recorded in our segment results, will primarily be recognized in the third quarter as we complete our review and remove the content. And going forward, we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift. Now, to dive into our quarterly results by segment, starting with our Media and Entertainment Distribution Business, a year-over-year decline in operating income was driven primarily by a $1 billion decrease at linear networks. DTC results improved versus a prior year in content sales licensing and other operating results in the second quarter declined modestly. At linear networks, results were consistent with guidance given last quarter, driven by decreases of approximately $800 million at our domestic linear networks and $160 million at our international linear networks. The domestic results decreased at both cable and broadcasting. At cable, this is largely due to higher sports programming and production costs, which were driven by the timing of costs for the college football playoff and the NFL we discussed last quarter. In addition to NBA contractual rate increases and higher sports production costs. Lower broadcasting results reflected decreases in advertising revenue across the ABC network and our own television stations. Second quarter domestic linear networks affiliate revenue decreased by 2% from the prior year, driven by a 6 point decline from fewer subscribers, partially offset by 3 points of growth from contractual rating increases. Rate growth was adversely impacted by 1 percentage point from the timing of revenue recognition from certain non-owned TV stations. Second quarter, domestic linear advertising revenue declined 10% year-over-year, although ESPN ad revenue is up 2% or flat when adjusted for certain non-comparable items, including CFP timing. The sports advertising marketplace is currently stable, with quarter-to-date ESPN domestic linear cash ads sales pacing up. However, the overall entertainment advertising marketplace has been challenging. While the weakness has moderated somewhat, we anticipate that some softness may continue into the back half of the fiscal year. But as Bob mentioned, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to be a leader in advertising throughout the business cycle, particularly as it relates to our capabilities in addressable and programmatic. And we look forward to sharing more details at our upfront presentation next week. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower advertising revenue, partially offset by lower programming costs. Moving on to the direct-to-consumer, operating losses improved sequentially by approximately $400 million versus Q1. During the second quarter, Disney+ core subscribers grew modestly, with over 600,000 net additions. Core international subs, increased by close to $1 million. While domestic subs declined slightly in the quarter from continued impacts from the price increase, domestic ARPU increased sequentially by 20%, reflecting strong subscription revenue growth. And while the softness we saw in Q2 domestic Disney+ net ads may linger into Q3, we do expect core sub growth to rebound in Q4. At ESPN Plus and Hulu, subscribers increased slightly over the prior quarter. ARPU at Hulu was impacted by lower per-subscriber advertising revenue, in line with the comments we made last quarter regarding near-term softness in the addressable advertising space. DTC expenses, including programming and production costs, and SG&A, declined in the second quarter versus Q1. Our direct-to-consumer operating results in Q2 outperformed our guidance by about $200 million, due in part to timing shifts of marketing expenses driven by recent slate changes at Disney+ and Hulu. The shift of some of those costs into the third quarter will contribute to Q3 DTC operating losses widening by approximately $100 million versus Q2. As we have noted before, the path will not be linear, as the strategic changes and improvements we're executing on take time to deliver, but we remain confident in our long-term trajectory, with continued opportunities to further improve results given our content duration strategy, planned price increases, expanding our relationships with our advertisers, and our on-going disciplined approach to costs. At Content Sales Licensing and Other, we generated a $50 million loss in the quarter, a bit shy of our prior guidance that results would be roughly break-even. Lower results in the second quarter versus the prior year were due to a decrease in TVS mod distribution results, partially offset by improved theatrical distribution results due to the continued success of Avatar, The Way of Water. In the fiscal third quarter, we anticipate this business's operating results will decline by $150 million to $200 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by timing of the marketing of theatrical releases, with key titles, Elemental, In Indiana Jones, and The Dial of Destiny, not premiering until very late in the quarter. Moving on to Parks, Experiences, and Products, operating income increased by over 20% versus the prior year to $2.2 billion, with increases at both international and domestic parks and experiences partially offset by lower merchandise licensing results at consumer products. Our international parks were a bright spot this quarter, with strong year-over-year operating income growth driven by higher attendance and improved financial results at Shanghai Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. At domestic parks and experiences, operating income increased 10% versus the prior year, driven primarily by the continued post-pandemic recovery of our cruise line, partially offset by a comparison to a gain from a real estate sale in the prior year. Q2 domestic parks operating income came in slightly below the prior year, but was still up over 50% versus 2019. Results generally reflects the cost pressures we cited in last quarter's earnings call, including wage increases, costs associated with new guest offerings, and other inflationary cost impacts. Domestic year-over-year increases in attendance and per capita spending were 7% and 2%, respectively. Per-cap growth was more moderate this quarter, as we are comparing against the first full quarter of offering GeniePlus and Lightning Lane at both parks in the prior year. Domestic parks and experiences operating margins were comparable to the prior year, once adjusted for the impact of the prior year's real estate sale. Please keep in mind that in the back half of this fiscal year, there will be an unfavorable comparison against the prior year's incredibly successful 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World. We typically see some moderation in demand as we lapse these types of events, and third quarter-to-date performance has been in line with those historical trends. This comparison, coupled with inflationary cost pressures, including from a new union agreement, is expected to drive a modest adverse impact to domestic parks and experiences operating margins in the third quarter compared to the prior year. However, we expect the contribution from continued strong performance at our international parks in Q3 to result in DPEP segment-level operating margins that are slightly higher than the prior year. DPEP will continue to be a growth business for our company, and we will manage all of these factors in line with our enduring focus on our guests. Before we conclude, I would like to note a couple of items related to our expectations for the total company this year. For fiscal 2023, cash content spend company-wide is expected to remain roughly comparable to last year, excluding any potential impacts from the writer strike, and we expect that fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will total approximately $5.6 billion. This is lower than our prior guide of $6 billion, largely due to timing of projects at DPEP as well as lower technology spend at DMED. We still expect fiscal 2023 revenue and operating income to grow in the high single-digit percentage range. There are still many moving pieces, including macroeconomic factors, the state of the global advertising market, and content timing shifts, which could impact our plans and expectations for the back half of this year. But as Bob mentioned earlier, we are incredibly optimistic about the long-term value creation opportunities that the changes we are currently executing on can generate for our company, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. And with that, I will turn the call over to Alexia for Q&A. Yes. Hi, Ben. I'll just further elaborate on some of the SG&A progress that we've had. And thanks for picking up that I did tease that by saying that we would need to exceed our targets of $2.5 billion. But, as we've gotten into this, there's been great cooperation throughout the entire company, which has been really rewarding, because we're looking at this and, of course, there's the reality of headcount reductions, and we're going through those. But there's also other things that we're finding more and more opportunities on eliminating redundancies, looking at ways to become more effective by utilizing resources, people and other resources across other businesses. But we're really leaning into all the opportunities. There's technology, which we've also seen a lot of good progress. Some of it will be, and I say some, will be realized in the balance of this year, really at the end of the fiscal year. But the real impact is going to help us in 2024. But, once again, since we're all into it, I think, once again, having it be company-wide and having, it be something that all of our business leaders have embraced, we are looking for a real comprehensive look throughout the SG&A buckets. Hi, Phil. Yes, let me address our results at Shanghai. They were incredibly positive this quarter. We've been really gratified to see the bounce back from the pandemic closures that we had. We're not going to get into too many specifics, but suffice it to say that the business is doing extremely well on both an attendance and a per-cap basis. We see that momentum continuing, and we also have some new attractions. We've talked about Zootopia coming later this year, and we believe that that is going to drive even further attendance and spending at the park. But Shanghai is doing extremely well, and we've been really gratified to see that bounce back. Like I said, it was closed for quite a long period of time during the pandemic. Hi, Michael. I'll address your question on content spend. As you know, this is an area that Bob is spending a lot of time working with our creative teams on. But when you think about that $30 billion overall, and Bob's targeted an annualized saving in the $3 billion range, I just want to remind everyone that the sports component of that amount is now over 30%, just due to the contractual rate increases that we've had in our contract rights, our sports rights. The other thing is, in fiscal 2023, we said that we're going to be roughly comparable to last year. Remember, last year we came in slightly below $30 billion. And this estimate does not include any potential impacts from the writer's strike. We have not estimated that, because that's a new development, and we haven't really quantified what that would be, because we don't know how long it's going to last. But in general, what we're really doing is looking at a lower volume of content, as I mentioned in my comments. And Bob is, once again, going through all of the development slates, and really looking at not only our Disney-branded, but also a more curated approach to our general entertainment content. Hi, Kannan. Let me address your question on parks earnings growth and the outlook there. So I think the way I would phrase this is we do expect a really solid year overall for our domestic parks. That being said, we also expect increased costs. And we alluded to that in our first quarter earnings call. And they're really coming from a few areas most predominantly. One is wages with the new union contract coupled with inflationary trends. We do have some new guest offerings. So there's some incremental operating expenses that come along with those. And we also have the operational support for adding a fifth cruise ship to our cruise line fleet. I think you all know that we launched the Wish back last fall. So we continue to look at ways to address cost management. The team down there has done a great job throughout the pandemic and then coming out of the pandemic. But they utilize a variety of tactics to mitigate potential margin pressures and downside risk across the segments. And some of the levers that they can utilize to really address it are by looking at capacity in some of our new attractions, they increase the footprint or increase capacity so we can open up the valve a little bit more on attendance. And with some new attractions that are more based on newer IP, so that will get more people not only coming in but wanting to come in and enjoy the experience while they're there. And we also are really continuing to focus on meeting our customer needs there. But we think that, this is a growth business for us. We've said so in the past. And I do just want to give a call out to our cruise business. That business, as you know, was the most impacted. And we had talked about that, that was going to be the last business to come back from the closures during the pandemic. But that business has come back incredibly strongly over the last year, this fiscal year. And even looking out to the balance of our fiscal year, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there and the reception to not only our new ship but also our legacy ships within the fleet. Hi, Mike. I will take the Disney+ ad tier question for you. As you know, we launched back in December, and we've just begun to scratch the surface of what we can really do on advertising on Disney+. And we look at this as an incredible opportunity for longer-term advertising positioning. Just to remind everyone, we do have a lighter ad load on Disney+ versus what we have on Hulu and also notwithstanding the very challenging macroeconomic advertising market, we're still seeing our consumers come into the not only existing but also new sign-ups come into that ad tier, so we're very encouraged by that. As Bob has mentioned previously, we have invested a lot in our ad tier technology and our data platforms for really providing state-of-the-art programmatic and addressable ad tools to our advertisers, so those are also investments that we've made and we believe are going to pay off not only today but position us well for the future as the ad market overall gets stronger. The other thing I just want to mention is we will be launching the ad tier on Disney+ in Europe by the end of this calendar year, so that will be another platform that we'll have or another offering that we'll have for consumers outside of the U.S. Hi, Doug. And I'll answer your question on the direct-to-consumer losses and the peak losses. Just to remind everyone, we did say, and it is the case, that we had peak losses in direct-to-consumer in the fourth quarter of 2022. That was the quarter that we reported in November. So what you've seen since then is we improved on a sequential, linked-quarter basis. You've seen a $400 million improvement in Q1, another $400 million improvement in Q2. In my comments, I did say that Q3, it would widen out by $100 million because of the timing of some releases and particularly the marketing of those releases. But that will be an aberration because it's not a linear path, but we will be improving significantly from 22 peak losses in Q4 through the balance of fiscal 2023. So, you should assume that what you saw back in Q4 was the peak loss and we have improved for the next two quarters, there will be that one little blip in Q3 and then we expect to be back on the path for the balance of the fiscal year. Thanks."

[Operator Instructions] Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay and transcript will also be made available on our website. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. We have a lot to get through today, but we will do our best to answer as many questions as we can. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Iger: Thank you, Alexia and good afternoon everyone. It\u2019s an extraordinary privilege to lead this remarkable company again, especially at the special moment in its history as we celebrate our centenary. Since I first became CEO in 2005, I have guided the Walt Disney Company through two significant transformations. The first was to confer greater creative control and authority to our creative businesses and to focus on great brands and franchises. It was also aimed at embracing new technologies and expanding internationally. It ultimately led to the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. Second transformation took place beginning in 2016 when we laid the foundation for Disney to become a true digital company. As we were planning to launch our streaming platforms, the opportunity arose to acquire numerous assets from 21st Century Fox. And that acquisition gave us a bigger library with more franchises, a broader global reach and a talented experienced management team that enabled us to generate even more higher quality content. In 2019, Disney+ launched with nearly 500 films and 7,500 episodes of television from across the world of Disney. Three years later, its meteoric rise is considered one of the most successful rollouts in the history of the media business. Now it\u2019s time for another transformation, one that rationalizes our enviable streaming business and puts it on a path to sustained growth and profitability while also reducing expenses to improve margins and returns and better positioning us to weather future disruption, increased competition, and global economic challenges. We must also return creativity to the center of the company, increase accountability, improve results and ensure the quality of our content and experiences. Now the details. Our company is fueled by storytelling and creativity. And virtually every dollar we earn, every transaction, every interaction with our consumers emanates from something creative. I have always believed that the best way to spur great creativity is to make sure that people who are managing the creative processes feel empowered. Therefore, our new structure is aimed at returning greater authority to our creative leaders and making them accountable for how their content performs financially. Our former structure severed that link and it must be restored. Moving forward, our creative teams will determine what content we are making, how it is distributed and monetized and how it gets marketed. Managing costs, maximizing revenue and driving growth from the content being produced will be their responsibility. Under our strategic reorganization there will be three core business segments: Disney Entertainment, ESPN and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Alan Bergman and Dana Walden will be Co-Chairman of Disney Entertainment, which will include the company\u2019s full portfolio of entertainment media and content businesses globally, including streaming. Jimmy Pitaro will continue to serve as Chairman of ESPN, which will include ESPN Networks, ESPN+ and our international sports channels. And Josh D\u2019Amaro will continue to be Chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, which will include our theme parks, resort destinations and cruise line as well as Disney\u2019s consumer products, games and publishing businesses. These organizational changes will be implemented immediately and we will begin reporting under the new business structure by the end of the fiscal year. This reorganization will result in a more cost-effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations and we are committed to running our businesses more efficiently, especially in a challenging economic environment. In that regard, we are targeting $5.5 billion of cost savings across the company. First, reductions to our non-content costs will total roughly $2.5 billion not adjusted for inflation. $1 billion in savings is already underway and Christine will provide more details. But in general, the savings will come from reductions in SG&A and other operating costs across the company. To help achieve this, we will be reducing our workforce by approximately 7,000 jobs. While this is necessary to address the challenges we are facing today, I do not make this decision lightly. I have enormous respect and appreciation for the talent and dedication of our employees worldwide and I am mindful of the personal impact of these changes. On the content side, we expect to deliver approximately $3 billion in savings over the next few years, excluding sports. Christine will be providing more details during the call. Turning to our streaming businesses, I am proud of what we have been able to achieve since the launch of Disney+ just 3 years ago. We are delivering more content with greater quality in more ways, in more places and to larger audiences. Like many of our peers, we will no longer be providing long-term subscriber guidance in order to move beyond an emphasis on short-term quarterly metrics, although we will provide color on relevant drivers. Instead, our priority is the enduring growth and profitability of our streaming business. Our current forecasts indicate Disney+ will hit profitability by the end of fiscal 2024 and achieving that remains our goal. Since my return, I have drilled down into every facet of the streaming business to determine how to achieve both profitability and growth. And so with that goal in mind, we will focus even more on our core brands and franchises, which have consistently delivered higher returns. We will aggressively curate our general entertainment content. We will reassess all markets we have launched in and also determine the right balance between global and local content. We will adjust our pricing strategy, including a full examination of our promotional strategies. We will fine-tune our advertising initiatives on all streaming platforms. We will improve our marketing, better balancing platform and program marketing while also leveraging our legacy distribution platforms for marketing and programming. This may include greater use of legacy distribution opportunities to increase revenue and more effectively amortize content investment. And as I said before, our new organizational structure will reestablish the direct link between content decisions and financial performance. This is one of the most important steps we can take to improve the economics of our streaming business. There is a lot to accomplish, but let me be clear. This is my number one priority. We are focused on the success of our streaming business and the return it generates for our shareholders long into the future. Before I turn this over to Christine, a few comments about the quarter. James Cameron\u2019s Avatar: The Way of Water, which was easily the most successful film of the quarter has become the fourth biggest film of all time globally with close to $2.2 billion earned at the box office to-date. The global popularity of this film will result in the creation of more opportunities for fans to engage with the franchise, which they have been doing at Walt Disney World\u2019s Pandora, the World of Avatar, as well as in theaters globally and on Disney+, where the first film has delivered very strong numbers. And today, I am thrilled to announce that we will be bringing an exciting Avatar experience to Disneyland. We will be sharing more details on that very soon. Avatar represents yet another core franchise for the company. And as you have seen time and time again, we have a unique way of leveraging creative success across multiple businesses and territories and over long periods of time. Speaking of our parks, we had an outstanding quarter in Q1, while we continued our purposeful efforts to control capacity to preserve guest experience. Last month, we also announced some price adjustments at our parks. We are listening to guest feedback and we are continuously working to improve the quality and value of their experience. We are also proud of our creative success as we led all studios with the most Academy Award nominations, including two best picture nominations, 20th Century Studio\u2019s Avatar: The Way of Water and Searchlight Pictures\u2019 The Banshees of Inisherin. Marvel\u2019s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever received five Oscar nominations. And in addition to an $840 million run at the box office, it launched on Disney+ last week and it has quickly become one of the most successful Marvel films on the platform. Looking ahead, we are excited about our fantastic lineup of new films coming to theaters this year, starting with next week\u2019s release of Marvel\u2019s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania; followed by other highly anticipated theatrical titles, including The Little Mermaid; Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3; Pixar\u2019s Elemental; Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny; and Disney\u2019s Haunted Mansion. Lucasfilms\u2019 The Mandalorian, the series that started it all for Disney+, will be back at the beginning of March for its highly anticipated third season. And today, I am so pleased to announce that we have sequels in the works from our animation studios to some of our most popular franchises: Toy Story, Frozen and Zootopia. We will have more to share about these productions soon, but this is a great example of how we are leaning into our unrivaled brands and franchises. The Walt Disney Company also won more Golden Globes than any other entertainment company this year, a total of 9, including for Abbott Elementary, the first broadcast show to win a Golden Globe for Best Series in nearly a decade. Without question, we have a world class television business that fuels both our linear channels and direct-to-consumer services, especially with the assets acquired through the Fox transaction. It goes without saying that the best shows lead to the most lucrative library and have the power to endure because of their quality. The Simpsons illustrates this perfectly. Disney+ launched back in 2019 with more than 30 seasons and it remains one of our top performers today. Across the board, our television business is second to none, and that includes ABC News, which remains America\u2019s number one news network. Power of ESPN brand also continues to deliver for us. In calendar \u201822, ESPN linear ratings were up 8% overall and 14% in primetime and we are also growing rapidly across our digital platforms. We are being selective in our rights renewals and continue to approach rights acquisition with discipline and a focus on supporting both sides of ESPN\u2019s business: traditional linear and digital. ESPN is more than just a network. And today, the team is harnessing innovative technology to deliver spectacular coverage and entertainment to audiences who have a deep connection to the brand and content. Now when it comes to investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders, we will take a balanced and disciplined approach as we did throughout my previous tenure as CEO, when we invested in our core businesses and acquired new ones, bought back stock and paid a dividend to our shareholders. As a result of the impact of the COVID pandemic, we made the decision to suspend the dividend in the spring of 2020. Now that the pandemic impacts to our business are largely behind us, we intend to ask the Board to approve the reinstatement of a dividend by the end of the calendar year. Our cost-cutting initiatives will make this possible. And while initially, it will be a modest dividend, we hope to build upon it over time. Christine will provide more information on that. And finally, on the topic of succession, the Board recently established a dedicated Succession Planning Committee. The committee is chaired by Mark Parker, who will become Chairman of the Walt Disney Company\u2019s Board following our annual meeting. I am excited to work with him in his new capacity and I am grateful to our outgoing Board Chairman, Susan Arnold, for her 15 years of tremendous service. Obviously, there is a lot going on, but as I said before, I am truly excited to be back and to lead this great company through this necessary transformation. I am grateful for our incredible talent and my exceptional leadership team. And with that, I will turn things over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thank you, Bob. It\u2019s great to have you back on these calls and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, our company\u2019s diluted earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 was $0.99, a decrease of $0.07 versus the prior year as continued strength at our Parks, Experiences and Products business was more than offset by a year-over-year decline at our Media Entertainment and Distribution segment. You heard earlier that we are embarking on a significant company-wide cost reduction plan that we expect will reduce annualized non-content-related expenses by roughly $2.5 billion, not including inflation. In general, we anticipate these reductions will be comprised of approximately 50% marketing, 30% labor and 20% technology, procurement and other expenses. Around $1 billion of this target was included in the guidance we gave last quarter. That fiscal 2023 segment operating income should grow in the high single-digit percentage range, which is still our current expectation. The bulk of the efficiencies we are realizing this year are related to reductions in marketing and headcount at DMED. The remaining portion of the target represents incremental SG&A and other operating expense savings, which will fully materialize by the end of fiscal 2024. Longer term, we also expect to realize additional efficiencies in our content spending with an annualized savings target of approximately $3 billion of future spending outside of sports. We will share additional details with you as we move forward on realizing these efficiencies. Bob also gave you some details earlier on the company\u2019s reorganization. The new structure and leadership roles are effective immediately and we expect to transition to financial reporting under this structure by the end of the fiscal year, at which point we will provide recast financials under our new segments. Until then, I will be walking through our results under the existing segments. Turning to Parks, Experiences and Products, we are thrilled with the results we achieved this quarter with operating income increasing 25% versus the prior year to over $3 billion, reflecting increases at our domestic and international parks and experiences businesses. At domestic parks and experiences, significant revenue and operating income growth in the quarter was achieved despite purposefully reducing capacity during select peak holiday periods by approximately 20% versus pre-pandemic levels in order to prioritize the guest experience. Per capita guest spend at our domestic parks also showed strong growth. Quarter-to-date, park attendance at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort are pacing above prior year. And based on reservation bookings, we expect to see this trend continue. Disney Cruise Line was also a meaningful contributor to the year-over-year increase in domestic operating income, reflecting higher occupancy in the existing fleet as well as the Disney Wish, which generated positive operating income in its first full quarter of operations. Domestic parks and experiences operating margins improved versus the prior year despite increased cost from inflation, operation support and new guest offerings, pressures, which we expect will persist into Q2 and beyond. At international parks and experiences, higher year-over-year results were due to growth at Disneyland Paris and higher royalty revenue from Tokyo Disney Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Shanghai Disney Resort. At Disneyland Paris, we remain pleased with the positive results we\u2019re seeing from the substantial investments we\u2019ve made. And at Shanghai, results reflect the fact that the resort was closed for roughly a month during Q1 of fiscal 2023. Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, operating income in the first quarter decreased by over $800 million versus the prior year, driven by year-over-year declines across direct-to-consumer, linear networks and content sales, licensing and others. However, we delivered a significant improvement on a quarter-over-quarter basis at our direct-to-consumer business as we progress on our path towards profitability with Q1 operating losses improving sequentially by over $400 million from Q4. The sequential improvement at DTC was driven by higher revenue and lower SG&A costs, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. Notably, in the first quarter, we meaningfully reduced DTC marketing expenses across all three categories: content, brand and performance. At both ESPN+ and Hulu, subscribers and ARPU grew sequentially with ARPU growth reflecting the impact of price increases that occurred in August and October, respectively. And at Disney+, core subscribers increased slightly, in line with our prior guidance from $102.9 million in the fourth quarter to $104.3 million in Q1. Disney+ core ARPU decreased by $0.19 versus the prior quarter, driven by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a higher mix of subscribers to our multiproduct offerings, partially offset by a benefit from the recent domestic price increase, which occurred towards the end of the first fiscal quarter. There are a few factors worth mentioning that we expect will impact Disney+ core subscriber and ARPU growth in Q2. The Disney+ domestic price increase has been playing out as expected, with only modestly higher churn, which may also negatively impact the fiscal second quarter given the timing of the December price increase. That impact, in addition to slower than previously expected growth in some international markets, suggests core Disney+ subs may grow only modestly in Q2 at a similar pace to the first quarter. As we have said before, sub growth will vary quarter-to-quarter, and we expect to see higher core subscriber growth towards the end of the fiscal year. Disney+ core ARPU will continue to benefit in the second quarter from the domestic price increase. And while it\u2019s only been 2 months since the launch of the Disney+ ad tier, we are pleased with the initial response, which includes continued demand from top-tier advertisers. As I mentioned last quarter, we do not expect the launch of the Disney+ ad tier to provide a meaningful financial impact until later this fiscal year. And like Bob said, we are reaffirming our guidance that Disney+ will achieve profitability by the end of fiscal 2024. Although, as I have mentioned before, our expectations are built on certain assumptions around subscriber additions based on the attractiveness of our future content, churn expectations, the financial impact of the Disney+ ad tier and price increases, our ability to quickly execute on cost rationalization while preserving revenue and macroeconomic conditions, all of which, while based on extensive internal analysis as well as recent experience provide a layer of uncertainty in our outlook. We remain focused on showing incremental improvements in our DTC metrics, and we will continue to provide transparency into our progress and key drivers. In our prior earnings call, we noted that we expected the improvement in Q2 operating results at direct-to-consumer would be larger than the improvement in Q1. We now expect Q2 DTC operating results to improve sequentially by approximately $200 million as improvements in the first quarter materialized more quickly than previously expected. Additionally, our view on Q2 now incorporates more challenging addressable advertising headwinds. Moving on to linear networks, first quarter operating income decreased by approximately $240 million versus the prior year. Domestic channels operating income grew year-over-year but that growth was more than offset by decreases at international channels. The increase at domestic channels was due to higher results at cable, while broadcasting results were comparable to the prior year quarter. Higher cable results were driven by lower programming and production costs, partially offset by decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs reflect lower NFL and college football playoff or CFP rights costs. The decline in NFL rights expense reflects the timing of costs under our new agreement compared to the prior NFL agreement, and lower CFP rights costs were due to timing shifts. Recall that we had two fewer games in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 versus the prior year as those games were shifted into Q2 this year. The decrease in cable advertising revenue also reflects the CFP timing shift. ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was down 4% year-over-year, but was roughly flat once adjusted for the CFP shift. And quarter-to-date, domestic cash ad sales at ESPN are pacing slightly below prior year when the two additional CFP games are adjusted out. Scatter/Data pricing remains above upfront levels. Although it has softened a bit in recent months, however, we are seeing solid advertiser interest for live events such as the Oscars and demand across sports also remains solid. Total domestic affiliate revenue in the first quarter increased by 1% from the prior year, driven by 6 points of growth from contractual rate increases, partially offset by a 5-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year due to lower advertising revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a decrease in affiliate revenue, partially offset by a decrease in programming and production costs. As a reminder, the first quarter held no IPL cricket matches versus 13 matches in the prior year due to COVID-related timing shifts. Looking ahead to the fiscal second quarter, we expect Linear Networks operating income will decrease year-over-year by approximately $1 billion. We expect Q2 will have the most challenging comparison for Linear Networks versus the prior year and anticipate a significantly lower decline in the back half of the year. There are several factors impacting the Q2 guide that I\u2019d like to walk through. First, recall that domestic Linear Networks operating income increased in Q1 versus the prior year, benefiting from the timing of costs under a new agreement for the NFL and a timing impact for CFP. These impacts will work against us in Q2. And as a result, ESPN is expected to account for approximately half of the $1 billion operating income decrease. Broadcasting and our other domestic cable networks will be adversely impacted in the second quarter by approximately $300 million, driven primarily by headwinds in advertising, and to a lesser extent, affiliate revenue, and international channels account for the remaining $200 million decrease. This includes timing impacts from BCCI cricket with eight additional matches versus the prior year, other contractual rights cost increases and additional top line headwinds. And at content sales, licensing and other operating results decreased versus the prior year by $114 million as higher theatrical results were more than offset by lower TV/SVOD operating income, higher overhead costs and a decrease in home entertainment operating income. These results came in below the guidance we gave in November, primarily due to softer-than-expected performance of certain theatrical releases. In the second quarter, we believe that content sales, licensing and other operating results will be roughly breakeven. Finally, before we conclude, I\u2019d like to say a few words about our focus on allocating capital in a disciplined and balanced way. As Bob mentioned, over the years, we have invested in our businesses to drive growth and return meaningful capital to our shareholders. Despite the impact of COVID, which had a significant adverse impact on the company\u2019s free cash flow, our balance sheet is strong and supports ongoing investment in our businesses. We still expect cash content spend company-wide to remain in the low $30 billion range for fiscal 2023. The longer-term content cost reductions referenced earlier in the call are not expected to impact this year\u2019s guidance range. We also continue to invest in our parks and experiences globally and in other capital ticks across the enterprise and expect that fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will total approximately $6 billion. This is lower than our prior guide of $6.7 billion primarily due to decreases in CapEx on our domestic parks, reflecting, in part, some timing shifts. Like Bob mentioned, given our recovery from the pandemic, strong balance sheet and commitment to cost cutting, we believe we will be on track to declare a modest dividend by the end of this calendar year. The amount will likely be a small fraction of our pre-COVID dividend with the intention to increase it over time as our earnings power grows. And in terms of our current outlook, as we sit here today, \u2013 we still expect that revenue and segment operating income growth for this fiscal year will be in the high single-digit percentage range, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move forward. I\u2019d also like to note that shortly after today\u2019s call we will be posting a presentation on our Investor Relations website, which will summarize many of the themes that we are discussing here today. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Christine. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you so much. Hi, Bob, as Christine said, it\u2019s great to have you back. It seems like a very different company than when you left even though it was only a couple of years ago, given the cyclical, but maybe more importantly, the secular challenges across all of your businesses, Linear Film, content competition, etcetera. So in the restructuring \u2013 what do you think are the quick fixes and what will take longer term to see the benefits of some of these actions? And on the $3 billion in cost cuts in content, is that largely fewer titles? And what does it mean for ultimate direct-to-consumer margins?\nBob Iger: Jessica, thank you for welcoming me back. Let me take the second part of your question first. We are going to take a really hard look at the cost for everything that we make, both across television and film because things in a very competitive world have just simply gotten more expensive. And that\u2019s something that is already underway here. In addition, we\u2019re going to look at the volume of what we make. And with that in mind, we\u2019re going to be fairly aggressive at better curation when it comes to general entertainment because when you think about it, general entertainment is generally undifferentiated as opposed to our core franchises and our brands which because of their differentiation and their quality have delivered higher returns for us over the years. So we think we have an opportunity to, through more aggressive curation, to reduce some of our costs in the general entertainment side and in general, in volume. In addition, the structure is now designed to place responsibility of all international programming and investment in content in the hands of one unit so that they can better decide the balance between what we make for global distribution and consumption and what we make for local distribution and consumption with an eye toward possibly reducing expenses there as well as we balance better. Obviously, all designed to deliver the profitability that we talk about delivering by the end of \u201824. In terms of your first question, I mean, indeed, it is times have changed, although in retrospect, looking back at it, not in an extraordinary way. Obviously, it\u2019s gotten more competitive. The forces of disruption have only gotten greater. And there are certain things, certainly, as a residual of COVID, they have just gotten tougher from a macroeconomic perspective. That said, we\u2019re still a company that is focused on creativity at its highest form. I love the fact that we are relinking the creative side of our business with the distribution and the monetization side of our business. And I think by doing that, we will see the impact of that reorganization fairly quickly. But when I think about the secular change that we\u2019re going through, generally speaking, I like our hand. We have an ability to balance how we take our product to market with legacy platforms, whether it\u2019s movie theaters or multichannel TV with, of course, the streamers. We have \u2013 and by the way, that helps us in a number of fronts, including advertising, monetization, stronger marketing. And so, I think that when you focus on the company\u2019s assets, in terms of our brands and our franchises. Yes, it\u2019s a tough environment, but the combination of the restructuring and the fact that we\u2019ve got these core brands, which when we get right creatively as we\u2019ve seen time and time again, not only differentiates us, but enables us to deliver fairly strong returns.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good afternoon. Bob, I\u2019m sure one reaction you\u2019ll get today from all this news is the future of television, I think is viewed as being streamed with linear obviously declining. I\u2019m sure you generally agree with that trend. So how do you think about that about your strategy as you\u2019ve laid out today in the context of that to make sure you\u2019re maximizing the returns globally of the franchises that you\u2019ve built? And then I was just wondering, maybe, Christine, on the Parks business, really strong margins this quarter, really kind of the return to the kind of incremental margins we\u2019re used to seeing, didn\u2019t sound like there was anything one-time. I just wanted to ask if this quarter is sort of emblematic of kind of how you see the rest of the year playing out from a trend point of view? Thank you, both.\nBob Iger: Thanks, Ben. Nice to hear from you. I\u2019ve been watching this very carefully for a long time. And what I\u2019m talking about is the impact of technology is basically creating a huge authority shift from the producer and the distributor to the consumer. And as that authority has shifted, it\u2019s made the traditional business more complicated, more to more challenging. And when you think about what streaming is, and we talked about this a lot as it related to multichannel TV, it is the ultimate ala card proposition for the consumer. It gives the consumer so much more authority than they ever had before because in reality, it gives them the ability to watch programs, not channels, not even bundles when you think about it. And because you are signing up in most cases for a 1-month subscription, you can sign up for one program, pay a relatively small amount of money and then end up basically unsubscribing. That\u2019s tremendous change. And I think what\u2019s going on right now is that as the linear business continues to erode, we have been basically eyes wide open on that. Christine commented about some of the challenges related to that, the streaming business, which I believe is the future and has been growing is not delivering basically the kind of profitability or bottom line results that the linear business delivered for us over a few decades. And so we are in a very interesting transition period, but one I think is inevitably heading towards streaming. So, what we are \u2013 the way we are basically contending with it, we have alluded to it today already is that \u2013 and this, I think is also directly related to our restructuring. We are going to rebalance a bit because those linear channels and movie theaters too still can provide us with significant amount of monetization capability. They enable us to amortize the cost better over multiple platforms and create some marketing cloud. When you think about it, Abbott Elementary airs on ABC, then it goes to Hulu. The demographic difference in age is tremendous. It\u2019s like 60-years-old or around, estimating on ABC and then the 30s on Hulu. That\u2019s a perfect example how the linear platforms, while they still have an audience and could help us monetize can still be used effectively, and we have that ability. And so we are going to monitor it very carefully. We are not in any way stepping away from streaming. It remains our number one priority. It is in many respects, our future. But we are not going to abandon the linear or the traditional platforms while they can still be a benefit to us and our shareholders.\nChristine McCarthy: So, Ben, great to hear your voice, and I will address the parks question. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we were really thrilled with the performance of parks in the quarter. There were no one-time items to call out. But the one thing I would mention is in previous quarters, we had mentioned that the recovery from the pandemic and our international parks was lagging domestic. And in this quarter, we had very strong performance, especially year-over-year from Disneyland Paris. We had the opening of Avengers Campus over there in July, and that is incredibly popular in driving attendance. And we also have a new hotel that was actually an old hotel that was redone into the art of Marvel. Again, very popular and attracting a lot of consumers to come out and experience that. The other thing I mentioned was the strength at our royalty stream from Disneyland in Tokyo. And the other thing not to forget is, this quarter, our first quarter of the year is seasonally one of our strongest when you look at it relative to other quarters. But the year-over-year comparison, it was an improvement, and we feel great about our business going forward.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you both.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Michael Nathanson at SVB MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Welcome back, Bob. I have two. The first is, when you go back to the second investment day you had for streaming, the company increased their TAM forecast, their investment spending and kind of vision for Disney+. Now that you have returned with more data and time, what\u2019s the vision for Disney+? You don\u2019t want to give us long-term targets, I get that. But what is the product vision? Is it a more narrow vision, any type of long-term size of the investment and awesome profitability case of D+ will be helpful. And then on linear, to Ben\u2019s question, a big part of the cost structure of sports costs, you have signed a ton in lately. But when you think about going forward, can you help us understand what will change going forward on sports rights investment in terms of must-have and not necessarily must-have? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Well, the second question, as you know, we have locked in a number of deals already, including some of the biggest ones, which is in college football with the SEC as well as with the NFL, the one that\u2019s looming is the NBA. And I know that\u2019s on people\u2019s minds, which is a product that we have enjoyed having and hope to continue to enjoy having, because not only it\u2019s volume, but it\u2019s quality. ESPN has been selective in the rights that they bought. I have had long conversations about this with Jimmy Pitaro, and we have got some decisions that we have to make coming up, not on something \u2013 not on anything particularly large, but on a few things. And we are simply going to have to get more selective. ESPN+ actually has grown nicely for us, and it\u2019s shown us that the ESPN brand can be enjoyed and can be expressed well as a streaming brand. And I think that we are going to continue to look at that as a potential pivot for ESPN away from the linear business. But we are not going to do that precipitously. We are not going to do that until it really makes sense from an economic perspective. On the first part of your question, what either \u2013 what\u2019s changed or where we headed from what was the second Investor Day. I think a few things. First of all, we were as a company in a global arms race for subscribers. And it was \u2013 the number of subscribers that have become kind of the primary measurement of success not only here in the company, but among in the investment community. And in our zeal to go after subscribers, I think we might have gotten a bit too aggressive in terms of our promotion and we are going to take a look at that. I listed a number of things on the call. That\u2019s one of them. I talked about pricing as well. That\u2019s another where we really have to look at are we pricing correctly, it\u2019s interesting, as Christine noted. We took our pricing up substantially on Disney+, and we didn\u2019t suffer any de minimis. We only suffered a de minimis loss of subs. That tells us something. It may also tell us that the promotion to chase subs that we have been fairly aggressive at globally wasn\u2019t absolutely necessary. So, pricing is definitely one thing, promotion, obviously is tied to that. It\u2019s also obvious to us is we can\u2019t get the profitability and turn this into a growth business without growing subs. So, while we are taking off the table sub-guidance, we are still going to look to grow subs. We just want to grow quality subs that are loyal and where we actually have an ability to continue to price effectively to those subs. In addition, we are going to lean more into our franchises, our core franchises and our brands. I talked about curation and general entertainment. We have to be better at curating the Disney and the Pixar and the Marvel and the Star Wars of it all as well. And of course, reduce costs on everything that we make because while we are extremely proud of what\u2019s on the screen, it\u2019s gotten to a point where it\u2019s extraordinarily expensive. And we want all the quality. We want the quality on the screen, but we have to look at what they cost us. So, we are going to continue to go after subs, but we are going to be more judicious about how we do that. We are going to look carefully at pricing. We are going to reduce costs, both in content and of course, infrastructure, there is a lot that we are getting out there. Marketing is another area where we are going to try to rebalance marketing of the platform versus marketing of the programs. Nielsen came out with something a few weeks ago that was stunning to us, and that was that 10 of the top 15 movies streamed in the United States in 2022 were ours. On that list was Moana and Zootopia and Frozen, but also Turning Red and Encanto. That suggests to us that our brands and franchises work extremely well in streaming. I mentioned how Wakanda Forever has done as well. So, core brands and franchises more efficient pricing, getting better in marketing, being a little bit more judicious at promotion, all of those things is how we believe we are going to get to turn the streaming business to a growth business. And one other thing, the streaming business is going to continue to grow, albeit at the expense of linear programming, but consumption of television is not decreasing, is actually going up.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi. Thank you. Bob, following up on Michael, there has been a lot of talk in the last year about whether Disney should keep spin or trade ESPN, and it now as a standalone segment, can you give us your view on the future of Disney and sports in particular, and maybe TV in general? How integral is ESPN to the company\u2019s future? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Thank you, Phil. We are fairly certain that when we created the structure and broke ESPN out on its own that it would lead to questions like this. We did not do it for that purpose actually. ESPN is a differentiator for this company. It\u2019s the best sports brand in television. It\u2019s one of the best sports brand in sports. It continues to create real value for us. It is going through some, obviously, challenging times because of what\u2019s happened in linear programming. But the brand of ESPN is very healthy, and the programming of ESPN is very healthy. We just have to figure out how to monetize it in disrupting and a continuing or disrupting world. That\u2019s it. But we are not engaged in any conversations right now or considering a spin-off of ESPN. That had been done, by the way, in my absence. And I am told the company concluded after exploring it very carefully that it wasn\u2019t something the company wanted to do.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Welcome Bob \u2013 my welcome back, Bob come in. Bob, there is some investor skepticism that theme park per caps and margins are elevated due to post-pandemic benefits that might expire. I am curious, in your view, does the theme park division still have healthy growth prospects from here, especially after a pretty good quarter, this quarter. And what do you see as the major growth drivers of theme parks going forward? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Nice to hear your voice again, Doug. We have been through many of these calls in the past. Well, the answer is yes on the theme parks in terms of their growth. I am very, very bullish about our parks and not just because of the COVID recovery. But to start with, demand on the parks is extraordinary right now. Now, we could lean into that demand easily by letting more people in and by more aggressively pricing. We don\u2019t think either would be smart, because we let more people in is going to reduce guest experience. That\u2019s certainly not what we want. And in fact, if you looked at our results this past holiday season, we actually reduced capacity certainly improved guest experience, and we are able to maintain profit, not just profitability, but a very, very successful or robust bottom line. We are going to continue to look at opportunities like that, which is essentially to simply get more creative in terms of managing the capacity that we have. I am going to come back to that in terms of growth, but let me also address the pricing side. It\u2019s clear that some of our pricing initiatives were alienating to consumers. I have always believed by the way, that accessibility is a core value of the Disney brand. We were not perceived to be as accessible or as affordable to many segments as we probably should have been. So, after basically paying heat to what we were hearing, we started to address it. And the steps that we took were actually were very, very positive. We got really great reaction to it. In addition, and it\u2019s tied to this is that we have put in place just basically more flexibility for the consumer in terms of how much it cost them to go. And interestingly enough, if you look at the increase of the core ticket, let\u2019s say, Disneyland, it has not really increased that much, maybe slightly ahead of inflation over the last few years. But one of the things that was interesting to me and coming in and examining our pricing is, we are making that available to people for only 15 days a year. So, if you look at our new pricing strategy, we made it available, I think was 50 days a year, so we greatly increased accessibility to our lowest price. And it is really well received. So, we are going to manage capacity very, very carefully. Some of that, by the way, has enabled us to essentially shift mix to \u2013 from annual pass holders to people who may come just once in a lifetime or once. They tend to be good customers of ours because of their per cap spending when they are there. That\u2019s really helpful. Some of the things that we put in place to manage basically annual pass holders was done to help us manage capacity without having doing too much damage to the bottom line. Lastly, we have learned that when we invest in increasing capacity, the Star Wars lands would be a good example of that, Pandora was a great example of that. We can grow our business. In fact, if you look at the results when we put Pandora and Animal Kingdom from year-to-year, they were stunning in terms of how many more people visited Animal Kingdom. I mentioned on the call that we are going to bring a version of Avatar to Disneyland. We have other opportunities as well. I have talked to Josh D\u2019Amaro about this very recently, like this morning, again, to really look at all the great franchises of the company and see where we can invest in them in the parks to increase capacity while preserving guest satisfaction.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. Bob, I will ask you a question that we have asked Christine a lot over the last year, which is you made the comment about ESPN+ expressing some success in streaming and sports. And there is probably now about 40 million homes who have decided to not be in the bundle. So, what do you need to see out there in the linear world to decide that an ESPN ala carte sports service in streaming should be the big leap for Disney? And then just a small one, you mentioned about how a lot of content can amortize in places other than streaming. You had talked a lot today about cost cutting. Should we think about licensing as also being a potential sort of big profit pool over the next few years? Thank you.\nBob Iger: I will take the second part first, Steve. Yes. The answer to the second part is yes. Now, when you say big, I don\u2019t know yet. I mean we are not really there. But when we bought Fox we greatly enhanced our television production and film production capabilities, bringing into the company great talent in both the movie and the TV side. As I have talked about getting more aggressive at curating general entertainment. By the way, we are not getting out of that business, but we are going to curate it more. We have opportunities using the great talent that we have to create for third-parties, and we are going to look at that very seriously. I actually think there is a nice opportunity to create a growth business for the company, but it\u2019s way too soon to predict what that can be. Regarding ESPN and when we might make the shift, if you are asking me is the shift inevitable, the answer is yes. But I am not going to give you any sense of when that could be because we have to do it obviously at a time that really makes sense for the bottom line. And we are just not there yet. And that\u2019s not just about how many subscribers we could get. It\u2019s also about what is the pricing power of ESPN, which obviously ties to the menu of sports that they have licensed.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thanks for the question.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christine McCarthy",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. It's great to have you back on these calls and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, our company's diluted earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 was $0.99, a decrease of $0.07 versus the prior year as continued strength at our Parks, Experiences and Products business was more than offset by a year-over-year decline at our Media Entertainment and Distribution segment. You heard earlier that we are embarking on a significant company-wide cost reduction plan that we expect will reduce annualized non-content-related expenses by roughly $2.5 billion, not including inflation. In general, we anticipate these reductions will be comprised of approximately 50% marketing, 30% labor and 20% technology, procurement and other expenses. Around $1 billion of this target was included in the guidance we gave last quarter. That fiscal 2023 segment operating income should grow in the high single-digit percentage range, which is still our current expectation. The bulk of the efficiencies we are realizing this year are related to reductions in marketing and headcount at DMED. The remaining portion of the target represents incremental SG&A and other operating expense savings, which will fully materialize by the end of fiscal 2024. Longer term, we also expect to realize additional efficiencies in our content spending with an annualized savings target of approximately $3 billion of future spending outside of sports. We will share additional details with you as we move forward on realizing these efficiencies. Bob also gave you some details earlier on the company's reorganization. The new structure and leadership roles are effective immediately and we expect to transition to financial reporting under this structure by the end of the fiscal year, at which point we will provide recast financials under our new segments. Until then, I will be walking through our results under the existing segments. Turning to Parks, Experiences and Products, we are thrilled with the results we achieved this quarter with operating income increasing 25% versus the prior year to over $3 billion, reflecting increases at our domestic and international parks and experiences businesses. At domestic parks and experiences, significant revenue and operating income growth in the quarter was achieved despite purposefully reducing capacity during select peak holiday periods by approximately 20% versus pre-pandemic levels in order to prioritize the guest experience. Per capita guest spend at our domestic parks also showed strong growth. Quarter-to-date, park attendance at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort are pacing above prior year. And based on reservation bookings, we expect to see this trend continue. Disney Cruise Line was also a meaningful contributor to the year-over-year increase in domestic operating income, reflecting higher occupancy in the existing fleet as well as the Disney Wish, which generated positive operating income in its first full quarter of operations. Domestic parks and experiences operating margins improved versus the prior year despite increased cost from inflation, operation support and new guest offerings, pressures, which we expect will persist into Q2 and beyond. At international parks and experiences, higher year-over-year results were due to growth at Disneyland Paris and higher royalty revenue from Tokyo Disney Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Shanghai Disney Resort. At Disneyland Paris, we remain pleased with the positive results we're seeing from the substantial investments we've made. And at Shanghai, results reflect the fact that the resort was closed for roughly a month during Q1 of fiscal 2023. Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, operating income in the first quarter decreased by over $800 million versus the prior year, driven by year-over-year declines across direct-to-consumer, linear networks and content sales, licensing and others. However, we delivered a significant improvement on a quarter-over-quarter basis at our direct-to-consumer business as we progress on our path towards profitability with Q1 operating losses improving sequentially by over $400 million from Q4. The sequential improvement at DTC was driven by higher revenue and lower SG&A costs, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. Notably, in the first quarter, we meaningfully reduced DTC marketing expenses across all three categories: content, brand and performance. At both ESPN+ and Hulu, subscribers and ARPU grew sequentially with ARPU growth reflecting the impact of price increases that occurred in August and October, respectively. And at Disney+, core subscribers increased slightly, in line with our prior guidance from $102.9 million in the fourth quarter to $104.3 million in Q1. Disney+ core ARPU decreased by $0.19 versus the prior quarter, driven by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a higher mix of subscribers to our multiproduct offerings, partially offset by a benefit from the recent domestic price increase, which occurred towards the end of the first fiscal quarter. There are a few factors worth mentioning that we expect will impact Disney+ core subscriber and ARPU growth in Q2. The Disney+ domestic price increase has been playing out as expected, with only modestly higher churn, which may also negatively impact the fiscal second quarter given the timing of the December price increase. That impact, in addition to slower than previously expected growth in some international markets, suggests core Disney+ subs may grow only modestly in Q2 at a similar pace to the first quarter. As we have said before, sub growth will vary quarter-to-quarter, and we expect to see higher core subscriber growth towards the end of the fiscal year. Disney+ core ARPU will continue to benefit in the second quarter from the domestic price increase. And while it's only been 2 months since the launch of the Disney+ ad tier, we are pleased with the initial response, which includes continued demand from top-tier advertisers. As I mentioned last quarter, we do not expect the launch of the Disney+ ad tier to provide a meaningful financial impact until later this fiscal year. And like Bob said, we are reaffirming our guidance that Disney+ will achieve profitability by the end of fiscal 2024. Although, as I have mentioned before, our expectations are built on certain assumptions around subscriber additions based on the attractiveness of our future content, churn expectations, the financial impact of the Disney+ ad tier and price increases, our ability to quickly execute on cost rationalization while preserving revenue and macroeconomic conditions, all of which, while based on extensive internal analysis as well as recent experience provide a layer of uncertainty in our outlook. We remain focused on showing incremental improvements in our DTC metrics, and we will continue to provide transparency into our progress and key drivers. In our prior earnings call, we noted that we expected the improvement in Q2 operating results at direct-to-consumer would be larger than the improvement in Q1. We now expect Q2 DTC operating results to improve sequentially by approximately $200 million as improvements in the first quarter materialized more quickly than previously expected. Additionally, our view on Q2 now incorporates more challenging addressable advertising headwinds. Moving on to linear networks, first quarter operating income decreased by approximately $240 million versus the prior year. Domestic channels operating income grew year-over-year but that growth was more than offset by decreases at international channels. The increase at domestic channels was due to higher results at cable, while broadcasting results were comparable to the prior year quarter. Higher cable results were driven by lower programming and production costs, partially offset by decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs reflect lower NFL and college football playoff or CFP rights costs. The decline in NFL rights expense reflects the timing of costs under our new agreement compared to the prior NFL agreement, and lower CFP rights costs were due to timing shifts. Recall that we had two fewer games in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 versus the prior year as those games were shifted into Q2 this year. The decrease in cable advertising revenue also reflects the CFP timing shift. ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was down 4% year-over-year, but was roughly flat once adjusted for the CFP shift. And quarter-to-date, domestic cash ad sales at ESPN are pacing slightly below prior year when the two additional CFP games are adjusted out. Scatter/Data pricing remains above upfront levels. Although it has softened a bit in recent months, however, we are seeing solid advertiser interest for live events such as the Oscars and demand across sports also remains solid. Total domestic affiliate revenue in the first quarter increased by 1% from the prior year, driven by 6 points of growth from contractual rate increases, partially offset by a 5-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year due to lower advertising revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a decrease in affiliate revenue, partially offset by a decrease in programming and production costs. As a reminder, the first quarter held no IPL cricket matches versus 13 matches in the prior year due to COVID-related timing shifts. Looking ahead to the fiscal second quarter, we expect Linear Networks operating income will decrease year-over-year by approximately $1 billion. We expect Q2 will have the most challenging comparison for Linear Networks versus the prior year and anticipate a significantly lower decline in the back half of the year. There are several factors impacting the Q2 guide that I'd like to walk through. First, recall that domestic Linear Networks operating income increased in Q1 versus the prior year, benefiting from the timing of costs under a new agreement for the NFL and a timing impact for CFP. These impacts will work against us in Q2. And as a result, ESPN is expected to account for approximately half of the $1 billion operating income decrease. Broadcasting and our other domestic cable networks will be adversely impacted in the second quarter by approximately $300 million, driven primarily by headwinds in advertising, and to a lesser extent, affiliate revenue, and international channels account for the remaining $200 million decrease. This includes timing impacts from BCCI cricket with eight additional matches versus the prior year, other contractual rights cost increases and additional top line headwinds. And at content sales, licensing and other operating results decreased versus the prior year by $114 million as higher theatrical results were more than offset by lower TV/SVOD operating income, higher overhead costs and a decrease in home entertainment operating income. These results came in below the guidance we gave in November, primarily due to softer-than-expected performance of certain theatrical releases. In the second quarter, we believe that content sales, licensing and other operating results will be roughly breakeven. Finally, before we conclude, I'd like to say a few words about our focus on allocating capital in a disciplined and balanced way. As Bob mentioned, over the years, we have invested in our businesses to drive growth and return meaningful capital to our shareholders. Despite the impact of COVID, which had a significant adverse impact on the company's free cash flow, our balance sheet is strong and supports ongoing investment in our businesses. We still expect cash content spend company-wide to remain in the low $30 billion range for fiscal 2023. The longer-term content cost reductions referenced earlier in the call are not expected to impact this year's guidance range. We also continue to invest in our parks and experiences globally and in other capital ticks across the enterprise and expect that fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will total approximately $6 billion. This is lower than our prior guide of $6.7 billion primarily due to decreases in CapEx on our domestic parks, reflecting, in part, some timing shifts. Like Bob mentioned, given our recovery from the pandemic, strong balance sheet and commitment to cost cutting, we believe we will be on track to declare a modest dividend by the end of this calendar year. The amount will likely be a small fraction of our pre-COVID dividend with the intention to increase it over time as our earnings power grows. And in terms of our current outlook, as we sit here today, \u2013 we still expect that revenue and segment operating income growth for this fiscal year will be in the high single-digit percentage range, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move forward. I'd also like to note that shortly after today's call we will be posting a presentation on our Investor Relations website, which will summarize many of the themes that we are discussing here today. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions. So, Ben, great to hear your voice, and I will address the parks question. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we were really thrilled with the performance of parks in the quarter. There were no one-time items to call out. But the one thing I would mention is in previous quarters, we had mentioned that the recovery from the pandemic and our international parks was lagging domestic. And in this quarter, we had very strong performance, especially year-over-year from Disneyland Paris. We had the opening of Avengers Campus over there in July, and that is incredibly popular in driving attendance. And we also have a new hotel that was actually an old hotel that was redone into the art of Marvel. Again, very popular and attracting a lot of consumers to come out and experience that. The other thing I mentioned was the strength at our royalty stream from Disneyland in Tokyo. And the other thing not to forget is, this quarter, our first quarter of the year is seasonally one of our strongest when you look at it relative to other quarters. But the year-over-year comparison, it was an improvement, and we feel great about our business going forward."

            "name": "Bob Iger",
            "content": "Thank you, Alexia and good afternoon everyone. It's an extraordinary privilege to lead this remarkable company again, especially at the special moment in its history as we celebrate our centenary. Since I first became CEO in 2005, I have guided the Walt Disney Company through two significant transformations. The first was to confer greater creative control and authority to our creative businesses and to focus on great brands and franchises. It was also aimed at embracing new technologies and expanding internationally. It ultimately led to the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. Second transformation took place beginning in 2016 when we laid the foundation for Disney to become a true digital company. As we were planning to launch our streaming platforms, the opportunity arose to acquire numerous assets from 21st Century Fox. And that acquisition gave us a bigger library with more franchises, a broader global reach and a talented experienced management team that enabled us to generate even more higher quality content. In 2019, Disney+ launched with nearly 500 films and 7,500 episodes of television from across the world of Disney. Three years later, its meteoric rise is considered one of the most successful rollouts in the history of the media business. Now it's time for another transformation, one that rationalizes our enviable streaming business and puts it on a path to sustained growth and profitability while also reducing expenses to improve margins and returns and better positioning us to weather future disruption, increased competition, and global economic challenges. We must also return creativity to the center of the company, increase accountability, improve results and ensure the quality of our content and experiences. Now the details. Our company is fueled by storytelling and creativity. And virtually every dollar we earn, every transaction, every interaction with our consumers emanates from something creative. I have always believed that the best way to spur great creativity is to make sure that people who are managing the creative processes feel empowered. Therefore, our new structure is aimed at returning greater authority to our creative leaders and making them accountable for how their content performs financially. Our former structure severed that link and it must be restored. Moving forward, our creative teams will determine what content we are making, how it is distributed and monetized and how it gets marketed. Managing costs, maximizing revenue and driving growth from the content being produced will be their responsibility. Under our strategic reorganization there will be three core business segments: Disney Entertainment, ESPN and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Alan Bergman and Dana Walden will be Co-Chairman of Disney Entertainment, which will include the company's full portfolio of entertainment media and content businesses globally, including streaming. Jimmy Pitaro will continue to serve as Chairman of ESPN, which will include ESPN Networks, ESPN+ and our international sports channels. And Josh D'Amaro will continue to be Chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, which will include our theme parks, resort destinations and cruise line as well as Disney's consumer products, games and publishing businesses. These organizational changes will be implemented immediately and we will begin reporting under the new business structure by the end of the fiscal year. This reorganization will result in a more cost-effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations and we are committed to running our businesses more efficiently, especially in a challenging economic environment. In that regard, we are targeting $5.5 billion of cost savings across the company. First, reductions to our non-content costs will total roughly $2.5 billion not adjusted for inflation. $1 billion in savings is already underway and Christine will provide more details. But in general, the savings will come from reductions in SG&A and other operating costs across the company. To help achieve this, we will be reducing our workforce by approximately 7,000 jobs. While this is necessary to address the challenges we are facing today, I do not make this decision lightly. I have enormous respect and appreciation for the talent and dedication of our employees worldwide and I am mindful of the personal impact of these changes. On the content side, we expect to deliver approximately $3 billion in savings over the next few years, excluding sports. Christine will be providing more details during the call. Turning to our streaming businesses, I am proud of what we have been able to achieve since the launch of Disney+ just 3 years ago. We are delivering more content with greater quality in more ways, in more places and to larger audiences. Like many of our peers, we will no longer be providing long-term subscriber guidance in order to move beyond an emphasis on short-term quarterly metrics, although we will provide color on relevant drivers. Instead, our priority is the enduring growth and profitability of our streaming business. Our current forecasts indicate Disney+ will hit profitability by the end of fiscal 2024 and achieving that remains our goal. Since my return, I have drilled down into every facet of the streaming business to determine how to achieve both profitability and growth. And so with that goal in mind, we will focus even more on our core brands and franchises, which have consistently delivered higher returns. We will aggressively curate our general entertainment content. We will reassess all markets we have launched in and also determine the right balance between global and local content. We will adjust our pricing strategy, including a full examination of our promotional strategies. We will fine-tune our advertising initiatives on all streaming platforms. We will improve our marketing, better balancing platform and program marketing while also leveraging our legacy distribution platforms for marketing and programming. This may include greater use of legacy distribution opportunities to increase revenue and more effectively amortize content investment. And as I said before, our new organizational structure will reestablish the direct link between content decisions and financial performance. This is one of the most important steps we can take to improve the economics of our streaming business. There is a lot to accomplish, but let me be clear. This is my number one priority. We are focused on the success of our streaming business and the return it generates for our shareholders long into the future. Before I turn this over to Christine, a few comments about the quarter. James Cameron's Avatar: The Way of Water, which was easily the most successful film of the quarter has become the fourth biggest film of all time globally with close to $2.2 billion earned at the box office to-date. The global popularity of this film will result in the creation of more opportunities for fans to engage with the franchise, which they have been doing at Walt Disney World's Pandora, the World of Avatar, as well as in theaters globally and on Disney+, where the first film has delivered very strong numbers. And today, I am thrilled to announce that we will be bringing an exciting Avatar experience to Disneyland. We will be sharing more details on that very soon. Avatar represents yet another core franchise for the company. And as you have seen time and time again, we have a unique way of leveraging creative success across multiple businesses and territories and over long periods of time. Speaking of our parks, we had an outstanding quarter in Q1, while we continued our purposeful efforts to control capacity to preserve guest experience. Last month, we also announced some price adjustments at our parks. We are listening to guest feedback and we are continuously working to improve the quality and value of their experience. We are also proud of our creative success as we led all studios with the most Academy Award nominations, including two best picture nominations, 20th Century Studio's Avatar: The Way of Water and Searchlight Pictures' The Banshees of Inisherin. Marvel's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever received five Oscar nominations. And in addition to an $840 million run at the box office, it launched on Disney+ last week and it has quickly become one of the most successful Marvel films on the platform. Looking ahead, we are excited about our fantastic lineup of new films coming to theaters this year, starting with next week's release of Marvel's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania; followed by other highly anticipated theatrical titles, including The Little Mermaid; Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3; Pixar's Elemental; Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny; and Disney's Haunted Mansion. Lucasfilms' The Mandalorian, the series that started it all for Disney+, will be back at the beginning of March for its highly anticipated third season. And today, I am so pleased to announce that we have sequels in the works from our animation studios to some of our most popular franchises: Toy Story, Frozen and Zootopia. We will have more to share about these productions soon, but this is a great example of how we are leaning into our unrivaled brands and franchises. The Walt Disney Company also won more Golden Globes than any other entertainment company this year, a total of 9, including for Abbott Elementary, the first broadcast show to win a Golden Globe for Best Series in nearly a decade. Without question, we have a world class television business that fuels both our linear channels and direct-to-consumer services, especially with the assets acquired through the Fox transaction. It goes without saying that the best shows lead to the most lucrative library and have the power to endure because of their quality. The Simpsons illustrates this perfectly. Disney+ launched back in 2019 with more than 30 seasons and it remains one of our top performers today. Across the board, our television business is second to none, and that includes ABC News, which remains America's number one news network. Power of ESPN brand also continues to deliver for us. In calendar \u201822, ESPN linear ratings were up 8% overall and 14% in primetime and we are also growing rapidly across our digital platforms. We are being selective in our rights renewals and continue to approach rights acquisition with discipline and a focus on supporting both sides of ESPN's business: traditional linear and digital. ESPN is more than just a network. And today, the team is harnessing innovative technology to deliver spectacular coverage and entertainment to audiences who have a deep connection to the brand and content. Now when it comes to investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders, we will take a balanced and disciplined approach as we did throughout my previous tenure as CEO, when we invested in our core businesses and acquired new ones, bought back stock and paid a dividend to our shareholders. As a result of the impact of the COVID pandemic, we made the decision to suspend the dividend in the spring of 2020. Now that the pandemic impacts to our business are largely behind us, we intend to ask the Board to approve the reinstatement of a dividend by the end of the calendar year. Our cost-cutting initiatives will make this possible. And while initially, it will be a modest dividend, we hope to build upon it over time. Christine will provide more information on that. And finally, on the topic of succession, the Board recently established a dedicated Succession Planning Committee. The committee is chaired by Mark Parker, who will become Chairman of the Walt Disney Company's Board following our annual meeting. I am excited to work with him in his new capacity and I am grateful to our outgoing Board Chairman, Susan Arnold, for her 15 years of tremendous service. Obviously, there is a lot going on, but as I said before, I am truly excited to be back and to lead this great company through this necessary transformation. I am grateful for our incredible talent and my exceptional leadership team. And with that, I will turn things over to Christine. Jessica, thank you for welcoming me back. Let me take the second part of your question first. We are going to take a really hard look at the cost for everything that we make, both across television and film because things in a very competitive world have just simply gotten more expensive. And that's something that is already underway here. In addition, we're going to look at the volume of what we make. And with that in mind, we're going to be fairly aggressive at better curation when it comes to general entertainment because when you think about it, general entertainment is generally undifferentiated as opposed to our core franchises and our brands which because of their differentiation and their quality have delivered higher returns for us over the years. So we think we have an opportunity to, through more aggressive curation, to reduce some of our costs in the general entertainment side and in general, in volume. In addition, the structure is now designed to place responsibility of all international programming and investment in content in the hands of one unit so that they can better decide the balance between what we make for global distribution and consumption and what we make for local distribution and consumption with an eye toward possibly reducing expenses there as well as we balance better. Obviously, all designed to deliver the profitability that we talk about delivering by the end of \u201824. In terms of your first question, I mean, indeed, it is times have changed, although in retrospect, looking back at it, not in an extraordinary way. Obviously, it's gotten more competitive. The forces of disruption have only gotten greater. And there are certain things, certainly, as a residual of COVID, they have just gotten tougher from a macroeconomic perspective. That said, we're still a company that is focused on creativity at its highest form. I love the fact that we are relinking the creative side of our business with the distribution and the monetization side of our business. And I think by doing that, we will see the impact of that reorganization fairly quickly. But when I think about the secular change that we're going through, generally speaking, I like our hand. We have an ability to balance how we take our product to market with legacy platforms, whether it's movie theaters or multichannel TV with, of course, the streamers. We have \u2013 and by the way, that helps us in a number of fronts, including advertising, monetization, stronger marketing. And so, I think that when you focus on the company's assets, in terms of our brands and our franchises. Yes, it's a tough environment, but the combination of the restructuring and the fact that we've got these core brands, which when we get right creatively as we've seen time and time again, not only differentiates us, but enables us to deliver fairly strong returns. Thanks, Ben. Nice to hear from you. I've been watching this very carefully for a long time. And what I'm talking about is the impact of technology is basically creating a huge authority shift from the producer and the distributor to the consumer. And as that authority has shifted, it's made the traditional business more complicated, more to more challenging. And when you think about what streaming is, and we talked about this a lot as it related to multichannel TV, it is the ultimate ala card proposition for the consumer. It gives the consumer so much more authority than they ever had before because in reality, it gives them the ability to watch programs, not channels, not even bundles when you think about it. And because you are signing up in most cases for a 1-month subscription, you can sign up for one program, pay a relatively small amount of money and then end up basically unsubscribing. That's tremendous change. And I think what's going on right now is that as the linear business continues to erode, we have been basically eyes wide open on that. Christine commented about some of the challenges related to that, the streaming business, which I believe is the future and has been growing is not delivering basically the kind of profitability or bottom line results that the linear business delivered for us over a few decades. And so we are in a very interesting transition period, but one I think is inevitably heading towards streaming. So, what we are \u2013 the way we are basically contending with it, we have alluded to it today already is that \u2013 and this, I think is also directly related to our restructuring. We are going to rebalance a bit because those linear channels and movie theaters too still can provide us with significant amount of monetization capability. They enable us to amortize the cost better over multiple platforms and create some marketing cloud. When you think about it, Abbott Elementary airs on ABC, then it goes to Hulu. The demographic difference in age is tremendous. It's like 60-years-old or around, estimating on ABC and then the 30s on Hulu. That's a perfect example how the linear platforms, while they still have an audience and could help us monetize can still be used effectively, and we have that ability. And so we are going to monitor it very carefully. We are not in any way stepping away from streaming. It remains our number one priority. It is in many respects, our future. But we are not going to abandon the linear or the traditional platforms while they can still be a benefit to us and our shareholders. Well, the second question, as you know, we have locked in a number of deals already, including some of the biggest ones, which is in college football with the SEC as well as with the NFL, the one that's looming is the NBA. And I know that's on people's minds, which is a product that we have enjoyed having and hope to continue to enjoy having, because not only it's volume, but it's quality. ESPN has been selective in the rights that they bought. I have had long conversations about this with Jimmy Pitaro, and we have got some decisions that we have to make coming up, not on something \u2013 not on anything particularly large, but on a few things. And we are simply going to have to get more selective. ESPN+ actually has grown nicely for us, and it's shown us that the ESPN brand can be enjoyed and can be expressed well as a streaming brand. And I think that we are going to continue to look at that as a potential pivot for ESPN away from the linear business. But we are not going to do that precipitously. We are not going to do that until it really makes sense from an economic perspective. On the first part of your question, what either \u2013 what's changed or where we headed from what was the second Investor Day. I think a few things. First of all, we were as a company in a global arms race for subscribers. And it was \u2013 the number of subscribers that have become kind of the primary measurement of success not only here in the company, but among in the investment community. And in our zeal to go after subscribers, I think we might have gotten a bit too aggressive in terms of our promotion and we are going to take a look at that. I listed a number of things on the call. That's one of them. I talked about pricing as well. That's another where we really have to look at are we pricing correctly, it's interesting, as Christine noted. We took our pricing up substantially on Disney+, and we didn't suffer any de minimis. We only suffered a de minimis loss of subs. That tells us something. It may also tell us that the promotion to chase subs that we have been fairly aggressive at globally wasn't absolutely necessary. So, pricing is definitely one thing, promotion, obviously is tied to that. It's also obvious to us is we can't get the profitability and turn this into a growth business without growing subs. So, while we are taking off the table sub-guidance, we are still going to look to grow subs. We just want to grow quality subs that are loyal and where we actually have an ability to continue to price effectively to those subs. In addition, we are going to lean more into our franchises, our core franchises and our brands. I talked about curation and general entertainment. We have to be better at curating the Disney and the Pixar and the Marvel and the Star Wars of it all as well. And of course, reduce costs on everything that we make because while we are extremely proud of what's on the screen, it's gotten to a point where it's extraordinarily expensive. And we want all the quality. We want the quality on the screen, but we have to look at what they cost us. So, we are going to continue to go after subs, but we are going to be more judicious about how we do that. We are going to look carefully at pricing. We are going to reduce costs, both in content and of course, infrastructure, there is a lot that we are getting out there. Marketing is another area where we are going to try to rebalance marketing of the platform versus marketing of the programs. Nielsen came out with something a few weeks ago that was stunning to us, and that was that 10 of the top 15 movies streamed in the United States in 2022 were ours. On that list was Moana and Zootopia and Frozen, but also Turning Red and Encanto. That suggests to us that our brands and franchises work extremely well in streaming. I mentioned how Wakanda Forever has done as well. So, core brands and franchises more efficient pricing, getting better in marketing, being a little bit more judicious at promotion, all of those things is how we believe we are going to get to turn the streaming business to a growth business. And one other thing, the streaming business is going to continue to grow, albeit at the expense of linear programming, but consumption of television is not decreasing, is actually going up. Thank you, Phil. We are fairly certain that when we created the structure and broke ESPN out on its own that it would lead to questions like this. We did not do it for that purpose actually. ESPN is a differentiator for this company. It's the best sports brand in television. It's one of the best sports brand in sports. It continues to create real value for us. It is going through some, obviously, challenging times because of what's happened in linear programming. But the brand of ESPN is very healthy, and the programming of ESPN is very healthy. We just have to figure out how to monetize it in disrupting and a continuing or disrupting world. That's it. But we are not engaged in any conversations right now or considering a spin-off of ESPN. That had been done, by the way, in my absence. And I am told the company concluded after exploring it very carefully that it wasn't something the company wanted to do. Nice to hear your voice again, Doug. We have been through many of these calls in the past. Well, the answer is yes on the theme parks in terms of their growth. I am very, very bullish about our parks and not just because of the COVID recovery. But to start with, demand on the parks is extraordinary right now. Now, we could lean into that demand easily by letting more people in and by more aggressively pricing. We don't think either would be smart, because we let more people in is going to reduce guest experience. That's certainly not what we want. And in fact, if you looked at our results this past holiday season, we actually reduced capacity certainly improved guest experience, and we are able to maintain profit, not just profitability, but a very, very successful or robust bottom line. We are going to continue to look at opportunities like that, which is essentially to simply get more creative in terms of managing the capacity that we have. I am going to come back to that in terms of growth, but let me also address the pricing side. It's clear that some of our pricing initiatives were alienating to consumers. I have always believed by the way, that accessibility is a core value of the Disney brand. We were not perceived to be as accessible or as affordable to many segments as we probably should have been. So, after basically paying heat to what we were hearing, we started to address it. And the steps that we took were actually were very, very positive. We got really great reaction to it. In addition, and it's tied to this is that we have put in place just basically more flexibility for the consumer in terms of how much it cost them to go. And interestingly enough, if you look at the increase of the core ticket, let's say, Disneyland, it has not really increased that much, maybe slightly ahead of inflation over the last few years. But one of the things that was interesting to me and coming in and examining our pricing is, we are making that available to people for only 15 days a year. So, if you look at our new pricing strategy, we made it available, I think was 50 days a year, so we greatly increased accessibility to our lowest price. And it is really well received. So, we are going to manage capacity very, very carefully. Some of that, by the way, has enabled us to essentially shift mix to \u2013 from annual pass holders to people who may come just once in a lifetime or once. They tend to be good customers of ours because of their per cap spending when they are there. That's really helpful. Some of the things that we put in place to manage basically annual pass holders was done to help us manage capacity without having doing too much damage to the bottom line. Lastly, we have learned that when we invest in increasing capacity, the Star Wars lands would be a good example of that, Pandora was a great example of that. We can grow our business. In fact, if you look at the results when we put Pandora and Animal Kingdom from year-to-year, they were stunning in terms of how many more people visited Animal Kingdom. I mentioned on the call that we are going to bring a version of Avatar to Disneyland. We have other opportunities as well. I have talked to Josh D'Amaro about this very recently, like this morning, again, to really look at all the great franchises of the company and see where we can invest in them in the parks to increase capacity while preserving guest satisfaction. I will take the second part first, Steve. Yes. The answer to the second part is yes. Now, when you say big, I don't know yet. I mean we are not really there. But when we bought Fox we greatly enhanced our television production and film production capabilities, bringing into the company great talent in both the movie and the TV side. As I have talked about getting more aggressive at curating general entertainment. By the way, we are not getting out of that business, but we are going to curate it more. We have opportunities using the great talent that we have to create for third-parties, and we are going to look at that very seriously. I actually think there is a nice opportunity to create a growth business for the company, but it's way too soon to predict what that can be. Regarding ESPN and when we might make the shift, if you are asking me is the shift inevitable, the answer is yes. But I am not going to give you any sense of when that could be because we have to do it obviously at a time that really makes sense for the bottom line. And we are just not there yet. And that's not just about how many subscribers we could get. It's also about what is the pricing power of ESPN, which obviously ties to the menu of sports that they have licensed."

Joining me this morning are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following introductory remarks from Bob, we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, I will now turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Iger: Good morning. As I reflect on the two years since I returned to the company, I'm incredibly proud of how much progress we've made. We've emerged from a period of considerable challenges and disruption, and we are well positioned for growth. We put in place specific strategies to generate growth across our businesses, and our solid results this quarter are a clear indication they've been successful. Given the momentum we see, we believe we can continue to drive healthy growth beyond this year, including our expectation of high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2025, accelerating to double-digit adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2026 and 2027. I'm especially grateful to my leadership team and everyone at Disney, who has played a role in setting us on this path for a new era of growth. On the creative front, our renewed strength is a result of the extensive work we began two years ago to restore creativity to the center of the company. In television, our branded series and general entertainment programming are performing exceptionally well, growing new audiences and winning an unprecedented number of accolades, including a record-breaking 60 Emmy Awards. In film, we are extremely proud of our performance at the summer box office, fueled by the top two movies of the year to date: Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine. We are excited to close out the year with two other highly anticipated titles: Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King. Looking to 2025, we have an extremely promising content slate, including Captain America: Brave New World, Lilo & Stitch, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash. Worth noting that a successful Disney movie today drives more value than it ever has in the past with our increased number of consumer touch points extending the reach and impact of our world-class storytelling from streaming to parks and resorts, cruise ships, consumer products and games. This multiplier effect means that the system economics of our movie business has never been stronger. Disney's Experiences segment continues to be the gold standard for the industry. And we have an investment strategy that is highly targeted in terms of projects, locations and IP and is designed to drive operating income growth and attractive returns. This all comes at a time when the footprint of our parks and experiences is growing. With six locations that attract guests from across the world, we have multiple exciting expansions currently in the works. After we unveil the Disney Treasure next week, Disney Cruise Line's fleet will grow to a total of six ships with seven additional ships currently in development. Plus our collaboration with Epic Games will allow us to integrate our popular brands and franchises in a transformational new games and entertainment universe. Meanwhile, we ended the quarter with 174 million Disney+ Core and Hulu subscription. And in five short years, we've built Disney+ into a streaming destination unlike any other with more than 120 million core subscribers. And with the addition of Hulu on Disney+, it is the ultimate collection of high-quality content for every member of the household from our extensive library of branded and general entertainment titles to news and live events. We have invested to make our already profitable streaming business a significant growth driver for the company, and we are strengthening that streaming offering even more on December 4th, with the introduction of an ESPN tile on Disney+. This is the beginning of an exciting new era for ESPN. And we have secured rights to many of the most popular sports for years to come at a time when the value of live sports is undeniable, contributing to an industry-leading portfolio of sports programming for Disney. And this integrated streaming experience moves us one step closer to bringing a full sports offering to Disney+ in the U.S. as we prepare for the launch of ESPN's flagship DTC offering in early fall of 2025. Taken as a whole, we have a lot to be proud of, both from a creative and a financial standpoint. And as we look to fiscal 2025 and beyond, we are confident in our continued ability to drive sustained growth and create shareholder value through our world-class portfolio of assets. And now we'll be happy to take your questions.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Bob. As we transition to Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourselves to one question in order to help get us through as many questions as possible today. And with that, operator, we are ready to take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Good morning, and thank you for all the detailed disclosure in the documents this morning and for filing the K along with our earnings. Appreciate it. Bob, I feel like the ESPN flagship launch is, in many ways, sort of the last big strategic pivot of your content assets to streaming after you've already accomplished that on the entertainment side. I know it was interesting you guys were guiding to sports OI growth in 2026, which will be the first year of that product. You also have the NBA costs to absorb. You talked a little bit about it in the prepared release this morning, but can you give us a sense for what you think that product is going to do for sports fans, for ESPN fans? And how it sort of moves the ball forward, sorry for the bad pun, in terms of customer experience and ultimately drives that segment as you look out beyond 2025? Because obviously, the linear challenges are well known on the ESPN side. And I don't know if I could just get you to give us some color on the acceleration in Experiences OI is expecting in 2025 from what we're seeing right now, that would be certainly helpful. Thanks a lot.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Ben. I'll address the ESPN question that you asked. I think as you look at flagship, you have to consider that it is ESPN like it has never appeared before for the consumer, meaning it will have not only basically the basic ESPN services, which is coverage of live sports and studio shows and commentary. But it'll have many, many other features like betting fully integrated. But I think one of the things that is \u2013 hasn't been appreciated yet is that when you apply technology to the presentation of sports, almost anything is possible. So imagine an AI-driven personalized sports center as a feature, for instance. Imagine essentially being able to tailor your sports experience, not just watching sports center, but in a thoroughly personalized way. I think essentially, it will be designed to serve the consumer in the most compelling way ESPN has ever served the consumer. The other thing I think you have to look at just in terms of being optimistic about the migration is that live is extremely, extremely attractive to advertisers today and live sports, in particular. So if you look at what's going on today, not just with ratings, but with interest from advertisers and then you look at the ad technology that we've already built and that we're continuing to improve, and you consider what that can do in an app-based world, not just in a linear world, the value we can deliver not just at our viewers or customers, but also to our advertisers will be very compelling. So highly customized, highly mobile, fully integrated with all kinds of features and in my opinion, the best product the consumer has ever seen in sports.\nHugh Johnston: Hi, Ben, it's Hugh. Obviously, for Experiences of why we guided to six to eight for the year, Q1 will be negatively impacted, of course, by the combination of the two hurricanes as well as the prelaunch cost for the Treasure. So Q1 will be negative. As we move through the course of the year, we'll move to positive in Q2 and then see further strengthening over the course of the year. The drivers on that are, number one, obviously, the Treasure is coming in, and we'll see continued strengthening from that. Number two, are we overlap our Q4 labor cost in Disneyland Resort. So that will be a positive from a lapse perspective. And then number three, we do expect the consumer to gradually strengthen through the course of the year. We also know that the bookings that we have in the back half of the year are positive right now. So we're optimistic about how bookings are looking as we get into the back half of next year. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. And our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Can you provide an outlook on consolidated advertising growth in coming years? You have so many tools in your tool chest like ad tech capabilities, as you mentioned, Bob. But on one hand, you have the linear challenge. And on the complete opposite end, you have the growth of entertainment and sports and streaming. And then secondly, could you give us some color on CapEx next year because it looks like free cash flow will be modestly down.\nRobert Iger: I spoke with Rita Ferro, who runs global ad sales for the company yesterday, just to get some up-to-the-minute flavor or color on what's going on in the market. One of the things that she said, by the way, is that linear is very strong right now. One of the reasons for that, by the way, is live and also because it provides \u2013 linear provides a differentiated audience than streaming. And the way we integrate those businesses, not just from a programming perspective or technology perspective, but from an advertising perspective gives us some interesting leverage in the business and enables us to offer advertisers a much broader, even deeper offering in terms of avails. So it's basically the combination of both is working for us. We're also programming them in an integrated way. So if you look at the fact that ESPN uses ABC to program the NFL on Monday nights in a simulcast way, significant amount of college football. You'll note when the season opens, NBA will continue to have a great presence on ABC. So you're not only offering the advertiser a differentiated audience and live, but you're also offering the consumer that, meaning the ability to watch sports on multiple platforms. Bottom line, it's working. Hugh? You're on mute, Hugh.\nHugh Johnston: Sorry. So yes, Jessica, I'll add to that as well. As you know, in 2024, advertising were 3%. We expect to be at or stronger than that as we enter 2025. As Bob mentioned, in particular, the ad tech stack that we've put together or our ability to deliver the right ads more effectively to consumers, particularly in the streaming business, is a competitive advantage that we've built. And it's owned and is proprietary to Disney. So we certainly feel optimistic about our ability to gain share in advertising based on that.\nRobert Iger: By the way, one thing I don't think is appreciated is that we're also working well selling inventory with Google and YouTube, basically offering advertisers to buy those platforms a differentiated audience through a trade desk mechanism. And our ad tech obviously enables us to do that.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. And our next question today comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Great. Thank you. Bob, since hiring Adam Smith from YouTube, anything you can share about his priorities and how that can impact the future of Disney+ or the other streaming products? And then, Hugh, can you maybe just share your confidence in achieving the strong double-digit margins beyond 10% in DTC in fiscal 2026? And because that guidance doesn't include Hulu Live, maybe just help us think about the future of that product, please? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Thanks for the question. Adam is already hard at work and making progress in improving the technology across all of our streaming businesses. And he's got a number of priorities. One, obviously, is flagship. Another is, as we noted in our comments earlier, that we're launching an ESPN tile on Disney+ on December 4th. So he's working on that. In addition to that, personalization, customization, designed initially to improve engagement. Just basically by adding a stronger recommendation engine capabilities on the home page, we're already seeing increased engagement in a very short period of time. He's going after password sharing. We launched in LatAm just this week, and we now are \u2013 we have password sharing or anti-password sharing initiatives, I think, at over approximately 130 countries. So that's also on his list. We're unifying tech stacks, including media serving and our entire ad stack across Disney+ and Hulu and basically a lot more. Obviously, what we're doing here is designed not only to create a better customer experience, but to increase engagement and reduce churn.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. And Robert, in terms of your answer on confidence around achieving the double-digit margins, it's probably best to sort of go back to the building blocks as to how we get there. Number one, we're looking to continue to grow subscribers as we have. And the thing I'd remind you of in that regard, given the point that we're in many ways that the DTC business shares a lot of the characteristics of a software business where an incremental subscriber has very, very high margins attached to them because it's relatively low incremental cost. So continuing to grow subscribers, number one. Number two, we certainly look to continue to increase pricing in line with the value that we're providing to consumers. And a lot of the growth that we're seeing right now is because of the exceptional content that's coming out of both the movie and the TV studios that's obviously our proprietary content. So that will certainly enable us to increase pricing over time. Number three, as Bob mentioned, a lot of Adam's priorities around product updates and features that will increase engagement and reduce churn, including improving the recommendation engine, is certainly going to be a benefit to our growth, increasing our ad monetization, as I was just discussing with the ad tech that we've built. And then, of course, international is \u2013 continues to be a significant opportunity. So add all of that together, we wouldn't give any of the guidance that we did if we didn't have confidence in delivering.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Robert. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you. So a multi-year guide is really impressive, and it's helpful since there are so many moving pieces of the segment. Over the last five years or so, I think Disney investor experience with guidance has at times been mixed under prior management. So just wondering how we should think about the ideological approach here to guidance as it relates to some of the conservatism that you've baked in. And in broad terms, is the acceleration in EPS growth from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2026, is that basically just comping the flagship launches and the hurricane and that sort of thing? And then just on flagship, just how do we think about maybe what the year one launch costs are, what the ARPU of that product could be? And when do you think you might be able to get to breakeven on that product? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. So why don't I handle the guide? In terms of the way that we're thinking about it, it's really driven by a couple of things. Number one is obviously the significant improvement in DTC, where we've invested a considerable amount of money in building that product. And number two, it's in light of the significant investments that we've made and are going to continue to make in parks and cruise ships and in \u2013 even in consumer products. So as we thought about those investments, we've obviously talked about the results that we've seen. And we feel very, very positively about those results. But we thought it was also very fair to give to investors not just operational results, but an expectation as to what we expect these investments to return, hence, the guidance rather than just focus it on the narrow pieces, although we've given you, I think, good segment detail, we thought it was also important to give you a picture of the overall company. So philosophically, because we've invested, we do feel like it's appropriate for us to give you a multiyear look because these investments are obviously multiyear in nature. In terms of our confidence in delivering it, obviously, we've got confidence in it. Otherwise, we wouldn't do it. We know it's important to deliver the guidance that we give, and that's why we've given it. So as it relates to flagship, I think it's a bit early to be talking about ARPU on flagship. We do think that product will be additive to us in 2026. And yes, there'll be an investment, then that's part of the 2025 guide. But that investment, we're looking to pay back relatively quickly in 2026.\nRobert Iger: To add to that, we have considerable visibility on our content pipeline as well. And one of the things that we've seen lately that is heartening is that when we have success in a feature film or even when there is expected success, the consumption of basically prior films \u2013 movies that have been made prior to the one that's coming out, goes up, spikes significantly on the platform. So if you were to look at the numbers for Inside Out 1 as Inside Out 2's trailer hit or what's happening with the first Moana film or what's happening with a number of Marvel properties since Deadpool & Wolverine came out. And I could go on and on. It's quite interesting for us in terms of raising consumption. So as we look ahead, I noticed some of the films in 2025, which is going to end with Zootopia and Avatar. And then you look at 2026 and you consider that we've got a Star Wars film, Mandalorian and Avengers film, a live-action version of Moana and on and on. We feel that one, we're confident in our ability to execute those films in a way that will serve us well, both qualitatively and commercially; and two, we have a strong sense that they're going to enable us to strengthen our streaming performance significantly as well as we're currently seeing with the films that we're putting out.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey. Thanks. Two, if I could. First of all, Bob, it looks like Comcast is going to move ahead with a spinoff of the cable networks. And I know you guys have looked at something similar in the past, maybe on the linear entertainment side. Is that something that you guys could revisit either as part of sort of the sort of more industry move? And then maybe more broadly, does the change in the administration, does that change your view on sort of opportunities with regard to M&A? And then secondly, maybe for Hugh, and I know you guys get this question every quarter, but just give us an update on sort of your view on the impact that the launch of the Epic Universe is going to have. It looks like that's going to hit early summer sort of just as you're expecting an acceleration in the parks business, just how you expect that to impact the sort of midyear and that acceleration in Experiences. Thanks.\nRobert Iger: John, Hugh and I will both take the question as it relates to divestitures or consolidation. I'll start on the consolidation front. In 2017 \u2013 late 2017, when we announced initially that we were acquiring assets from 20th Century Fox, we specifically mentioned that we were doing so through the lens of streaming. We saw a world where streaming was going to proliferate, and we knew we needed not only more content with \u2013 but more distribution. And with that came just a tremendous amount of content. We've talked about it when we talk \u2013 when you talk about 60 Emmy's, so much of that came from that acquisition or when we talk about Avatar as for instance, that came from that acquisition. I could go on and on. In addition to that, people forget, that came with control of Hulu and ultimately ownership of Hulu. That distribution packaged well, integrated well with Disney+ has enabled us to achieve the numbers we have achieved, which is approximately 174 million global subscribers and an ability to really see into the future of streaming with \u2013 through a very optimistic lens. So in a way, we've already consolidated. And while I think we'll always look opportunistically at opportunities as we've proven in the past, we certainly don't shy away from those. We, in many respects, have already consolidated. We don't really need more assets right now, either from a distribution or from a content perspective to thrive in basically a disruptive media world.\nHugh Johnston: Got it. And John, I'll answer the divestiture piece as well as your question on Epic. Regarding divestitures, one of the first things I did when I came in as CFO of PepsiCo was to take a look at whether there was an opportunity here to create value through divestitures. And candidly, I just didn't see one, and I spent a considerable amount of time studying it first from a financial perspective. And it's always easy to sort of play with spreadsheets and sort of make the math look like there's value creation. But at the end of the day, there's two things to consider. Number one is, what are the prices you would get? And then number two, what's the frictional cost operationally of separating those assets? And as I went through the math on both, it was pretty clear to me that there wasn't a value-creating opportunity for Disney. I can't speak to other companies and what opportunities they have with the assets they have. But I absolutely did not see that for Disney. Regarding Epic, we did model that into our expectations for the experiences outlook. As I mentioned earlier, the early bookings that we have next summer are actually positive. So that's certainly a positive indicator. We also looked at the history of other attractions opening up and other parks opening up in Florida. And it's generally been beneficial to us. So that is all very much captured in the guide that we provided.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Morris of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions. First, with respect to content production, you've been focused on quality over quantity have you been \u2013 as you've been strengthening the core of the business. How are you thinking about growth in spend into that pipeline going forward, both in 2025 and maybe just sort of the pace of content growth beyond that? And then secondly, appreciate the listing of the new projects that you have on the Experiences side. You have a number of footprint expansions, especially in the U.S. So when you think about the longer-term return on these investments, how much of that is driven by really expanding capacity and accommodating more guests maybe versus driving the pricing power at the parks because you have these great new attractions? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: I'll take the content production side. We feel we have a great hand. But as we look to grow our streaming business, we believe there will be opportunities and even a need for us to do some selective investing outside the United States, notably in EMEA and in APAC. We've slowed down our investment in those markets. And in fact, we're being careful about our overall investment until we get the technology right, until we improve the technology because clearly, if we can use technology to reduce churn, which we're already doing, then in reality, what we're doing is we're increasing return our investment in content. And we don't \u2013 so we don't want to spend on the content side until we're confident that we can get the necessary returns on those investments. But we know as we look to grow our streaming business that prioritizing markets outside the United States with specific content in those markets will be part of that strategy. I don't think you should consider those investments to be enormous in nature by any stretch of the imagination because we know that we're making content that has global application. If you look at just the movies that I mentioned as for instance, that work not in all markets, but in most markets. But we don't have to spend as much as some of our competitors. And as there's movies \u2013 it's not just the franchise value. As they become more successful, obviously, they drive more value as well.\nHugh Johnston: Yes, Mike. And just to add to Bob's comments on that, we have modeled in some incremental growth in content spend, not enough to be significantly disruptive to the overall cash flow or algorithm for the company, but we have absolutely modeled that in because we do view international as a terrific opportunity. Regarding your question on Experiences and particularly the parks pricing versus attendance, what we projected in is a balance of both. So I don't want to get into specific numbers on it. But we're not assuming it's going to be just price or it's just going to be attendance. There'll be a balance of both. And frankly, we'll have the ability to flex that as we learn our way into it. But I think we've got it modeled reasonably conservatively.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Mike. Next question, please.\nOperator: Absolutely. And our next question today comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you for the question and forward commentary. One area that understandably received less focus on the outlook was linear network. Interested to understand better how you built the multiyear forecast, how you thought about managing that business over the next several years. And then just relatedly, it's the first call post the DirecTV agreement. Can you speak to any important impact to Disney, how we should think of that deal structure as a template going forward versus some other deals you've done in the recent past like Charter? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: I'll handle that one, David. Regarding linear, we modeled that it would continue to decline. The beauty of the position we find ourselves in right now with roughly 175 million streaming consumers is we have a bit of a natural hedge in the way that our portfolio operates. So to the degree that people leave linear and choose to go to streaming route, generally speaking, they're going to be coming our way. And we have obviously terrific ways to monetize those. So as that evolves based on consumer choice, I think we're well positioned if they decide to stay in linear for longer. I think we're well positioned if they decide to move over to the streaming side. And frankly, with what we've put on the service and what \u2013 the plans that we have to put more things on the service, I think in many ways, we're sort of a must-have platform inside of most households. Regarding DirecTV, like all of these deals, they're basically uniquely crafted to the situation of that particular partner. So I wouldn't try to read through any of that into any other deals. I think it's a good deal for us. I think it's a good deal for them, and we both feel good about where we've gone. But I think these things are generally going to be somewhat bespoke.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. And our next question today comes from Laurent Yoon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLaurent Yoon: Thank you for taking the question. It's great to see continuing momentum in streaming, and the margin expansion story is certainly very promising. Building on your comments around the building blocks of that growth, could you provide some color on how much of that growth is subscriber growth versus pricing in the foreseeable future and of course, 2025 \u2013 fiscal year 2025, in particular. And on a related question, local language content seems paramount to \u2013 very important to increase engagement in local markets. And we see our competitors expanding local content perhaps more than what we see on Disney platforms. So do you have plans to be more aggressive in international expansion with more locally tailored content? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Happy to address those. Regarding streaming, we expect our growth to come from a balance of pricing as well as growth. It may tilt slightly towards pricing. And again, we're going to read the market, and we can react to it as it plays out. But our expectation right now is it will be both subs and pricing, a little bit more tilted towards pricing. Regarding local content, I'm not sure I have much more to add to what Bob had already mentioned, which is we do see it as valuable. We actually do a reasonable amount of that already, particularly in APAC with some of the Korean dramas that we do, and we also do some in Latin America. But as Bob mentioned, we don't want to invest too heavily there until we feel like we're comfortable with the product such that we'll have the churn operating at right levels. So that's my expectation.\nRobert Iger: I'll add to that. We had two billion-dollar movies so far this year, actually the only two in the industry. The box office that those movies garnered came from all over the world. So those movies resonate in those markets. And if you look at some of our competitors who don't have movies of basically that quality or that level of success, they have to spend more in local content because they don't have that. The other thing I would just want to say about pricing is it's not just about raising pricing, it's about moving consumers to the advertiser-supported side of the streaming platform. So right now, in the United States, about 60% of all new subs are going to \u2013 are buying our streaming services, advertiser support or AVOD. I think right now, I think it's 37% of total subs in the U.S. are AVOD subs and \u2013 37% in the U.S. and 30% globally. So the pricing that we recently put into place, which has increased pricing, was actually designed to move more people in the AVOD direction because we know the ARPU and interest in it from advertisers and streaming has grown.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Laurent. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nTim Nollen: Hi. Thanks, very much. Could you please address the topic of divestitures in India? I think you mentioned in the guidance a few lines that incorporate those. I just wonder if there's anything more to add to adjustments we should make for the sale of the assets in India? And then relatedly, what are the \u2013 what is the business going to look like for you in India? I think you're going to retain a stake with Reliance. Just talk a little bit about your presence in India post the divestiture or the partial sale, please.\nHugh Johnston: Yes, happy to address that. We're very, very excited about the deal with Reliance. Obviously, they're a terrific company and have huge presence in India. Going forward, we will have a percentage ownership...\nRobert Iger: I was supposed to disclose those AVOD numbers...\nHugh Johnston: We'll have a percentage ownership in the high 30s. And obviously, the Reliance people with their share of ownership will be managing the business. In terms of the specific implications on Disney's financials, we did anticipate closing. We've got it included in the guidance. To the degree that you have more detailed questions around that, I'm sure the Investor Relations team can help you model that out.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Tim. Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. And today's final question will come from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask just one on Parks and one on Disney+. So on Parks, is the softness in domestic behind you at this point? It seems like performance there was better than you expected when you reported back in August. And on the international side, it seems like there was some new softness that showed up in 4Q in the international parks. So in light of that, I just wanted to ask how we should think about international growth going forward? And then my question on Disney+ really has to do with the sub growth in the quarter, which was strong in international core subs. Was there anything chunky in the quarter like a wholesale relationship coming online? Or is this seasonality? I know there was a similar jump in 4Q 2023, or was it some other factor? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Sure. Happy to take those, Bryan. You're right. In domestic, we certainly feel like the consumer is strengthening. As I mentioned earlier, we obviously saw growth in domestic parks and certainly feel very positively about that. And that's our expectation going forward, is a gradual strengthening in the consumer. Regarding international, two factors. Number one, the Olympics in Paris, that whenever there is an Olympics in the city that we have a park, we typically see an attendance hit, and that's exactly what we saw. We saw that coming, which is why we indicated that to you back on the Q3 call in terms of our expectation. In addition to that, we saw some consumer softness in Shanghai. Candidly, we expect that to be temporary, and we expect that to bounce back as well. But it was nothing that should be concerning for the long-term regarding the parks. Regarding international subs, no, nothing chunky. This was good solid additions to the subscriber base in international. So we came off of Q3 and obviously had considerable success in adding subs in Q4.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Bryan, and thanks, everyone, for your questions. We want to thank you again for joining us, and wish everyone a good rest of the day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Robert Iger",
            "content": "Good morning. As I reflect on the two years since I returned to the company, I'm incredibly proud of how much progress we've made. We've emerged from a period of considerable challenges and disruption, and we are well positioned for growth. We put in place specific strategies to generate growth across our businesses, and our solid results this quarter are a clear indication they've been successful. Given the momentum we see, we believe we can continue to drive healthy growth beyond this year, including our expectation of high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2025, accelerating to double-digit adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2026 and 2027. I'm especially grateful to my leadership team and everyone at Disney, who has played a role in setting us on this path for a new era of growth. On the creative front, our renewed strength is a result of the extensive work we began two years ago to restore creativity to the center of the company. In television, our branded series and general entertainment programming are performing exceptionally well, growing new audiences and winning an unprecedented number of accolades, including a record-breaking 60 Emmy Awards. In film, we are extremely proud of our performance at the summer box office, fueled by the top two movies of the year to date: Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine. We are excited to close out the year with two other highly anticipated titles: Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King. Looking to 2025, we have an extremely promising content slate, including Captain America: Brave New World, Lilo & Stitch, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash. Worth noting that a successful Disney movie today drives more value than it ever has in the past with our increased number of consumer touch points extending the reach and impact of our world-class storytelling from streaming to parks and resorts, cruise ships, consumer products and games. This multiplier effect means that the system economics of our movie business has never been stronger. Disney's Experiences segment continues to be the gold standard for the industry. And we have an investment strategy that is highly targeted in terms of projects, locations and IP and is designed to drive operating income growth and attractive returns. This all comes at a time when the footprint of our parks and experiences is growing. With six locations that attract guests from across the world, we have multiple exciting expansions currently in the works. After we unveil the Disney Treasure next week, Disney Cruise Line's fleet will grow to a total of six ships with seven additional ships currently in development. Plus our collaboration with Epic Games will allow us to integrate our popular brands and franchises in a transformational new games and entertainment universe. Meanwhile, we ended the quarter with 174 million Disney+ Core and Hulu subscription. And in five short years, we've built Disney+ into a streaming destination unlike any other with more than 120 million core subscribers. And with the addition of Hulu on Disney+, it is the ultimate collection of high-quality content for every member of the household from our extensive library of branded and general entertainment titles to news and live events. We have invested to make our already profitable streaming business a significant growth driver for the company, and we are strengthening that streaming offering even more on December 4th, with the introduction of an ESPN tile on Disney+. This is the beginning of an exciting new era for ESPN. And we have secured rights to many of the most popular sports for years to come at a time when the value of live sports is undeniable, contributing to an industry-leading portfolio of sports programming for Disney. And this integrated streaming experience moves us one step closer to bringing a full sports offering to Disney+ in the U.S. as we prepare for the launch of ESPN's flagship DTC offering in early fall of 2025. Taken as a whole, we have a lot to be proud of, both from a creative and a financial standpoint. And as we look to fiscal 2025 and beyond, we are confident in our continued ability to drive sustained growth and create shareholder value through our world-class portfolio of assets. And now we'll be happy to take your questions. Thanks, Ben. I'll address the ESPN question that you asked. I think as you look at flagship, you have to consider that it is ESPN like it has never appeared before for the consumer, meaning it will have not only basically the basic ESPN services, which is coverage of live sports and studio shows and commentary. But it'll have many, many other features like betting fully integrated. But I think one of the things that is \u2013 hasn't been appreciated yet is that when you apply technology to the presentation of sports, almost anything is possible. So imagine an AI-driven personalized sports center as a feature, for instance. Imagine essentially being able to tailor your sports experience, not just watching sports center, but in a thoroughly personalized way. I think essentially, it will be designed to serve the consumer in the most compelling way ESPN has ever served the consumer. The other thing I think you have to look at just in terms of being optimistic about the migration is that live is extremely, extremely attractive to advertisers today and live sports, in particular. So if you look at what's going on today, not just with ratings, but with interest from advertisers and then you look at the ad technology that we've already built and that we're continuing to improve, and you consider what that can do in an app-based world, not just in a linear world, the value we can deliver not just at our viewers or customers, but also to our advertisers will be very compelling. So highly customized, highly mobile, fully integrated with all kinds of features and in my opinion, the best product the consumer has ever seen in sports. I spoke with Rita Ferro, who runs global ad sales for the company yesterday, just to get some up-to-the-minute flavor or color on what's going on in the market. One of the things that she said, by the way, is that linear is very strong right now. One of the reasons for that, by the way, is live and also because it provides \u2013 linear provides a differentiated audience than streaming. And the way we integrate those businesses, not just from a programming perspective or technology perspective, but from an advertising perspective gives us some interesting leverage in the business and enables us to offer advertisers a much broader, even deeper offering in terms of avails. So it's basically the combination of both is working for us. We're also programming them in an integrated way. So if you look at the fact that ESPN uses ABC to program the NFL on Monday nights in a simulcast way, significant amount of college football. You'll note when the season opens, NBA will continue to have a great presence on ABC. So you're not only offering the advertiser a differentiated audience and live, but you're also offering the consumer that, meaning the ability to watch sports on multiple platforms. Bottom line, it's working. Hugh? You're on mute, Hugh. By the way, one thing I don't think is appreciated is that we're also working well selling inventory with Google and YouTube, basically offering advertisers to buy those platforms a differentiated audience through a trade desk mechanism. And our ad tech obviously enables us to do that. Thanks for the question. Adam is already hard at work and making progress in improving the technology across all of our streaming businesses. And he's got a number of priorities. One, obviously, is flagship. Another is, as we noted in our comments earlier, that we're launching an ESPN tile on Disney+ on December 4th. So he's working on that. In addition to that, personalization, customization, designed initially to improve engagement. Just basically by adding a stronger recommendation engine capabilities on the home page, we're already seeing increased engagement in a very short period of time. He's going after password sharing. We launched in LatAm just this week, and we now are \u2013 we have password sharing or anti-password sharing initiatives, I think, at over approximately 130 countries. So that's also on his list. We're unifying tech stacks, including media serving and our entire ad stack across Disney+ and Hulu and basically a lot more. Obviously, what we're doing here is designed not only to create a better customer experience, but to increase engagement and reduce churn. To add to that, we have considerable visibility on our content pipeline as well. And one of the things that we've seen lately that is heartening is that when we have success in a feature film or even when there is expected success, the consumption of basically prior films \u2013 movies that have been made prior to the one that's coming out, goes up, spikes significantly on the platform. So if you were to look at the numbers for Inside Out 1 as Inside Out 2's trailer hit or what's happening with the first Moana film or what's happening with a number of Marvel properties since Deadpool & Wolverine came out. And I could go on and on. It's quite interesting for us in terms of raising consumption. So as we look ahead, I noticed some of the films in 2025, which is going to end with Zootopia and Avatar. And then you look at 2026 and you consider that we've got a Star Wars film, Mandalorian and Avengers film, a live-action version of Moana and on and on. We feel that one, we're confident in our ability to execute those films in a way that will serve us well, both qualitatively and commercially; and two, we have a strong sense that they're going to enable us to strengthen our streaming performance significantly as well as we're currently seeing with the films that we're putting out. John, Hugh and I will both take the question as it relates to divestitures or consolidation. I'll start on the consolidation front. In 2017 \u2013 late 2017, when we announced initially that we were acquiring assets from 20th Century Fox, we specifically mentioned that we were doing so through the lens of streaming. We saw a world where streaming was going to proliferate, and we knew we needed not only more content with \u2013 but more distribution. And with that came just a tremendous amount of content. We've talked about it when we talk \u2013 when you talk about 60 Emmy's, so much of that came from that acquisition or when we talk about Avatar as for instance, that came from that acquisition. I could go on and on. In addition to that, people forget, that came with control of Hulu and ultimately ownership of Hulu. That distribution packaged well, integrated well with Disney+ has enabled us to achieve the numbers we have achieved, which is approximately 174 million global subscribers and an ability to really see into the future of streaming with \u2013 through a very optimistic lens. So in a way, we've already consolidated. And while I think we'll always look opportunistically at opportunities as we've proven in the past, we certainly don't shy away from those. We, in many respects, have already consolidated. We don't really need more assets right now, either from a distribution or from a content perspective to thrive in basically a disruptive media world. I'll take the content production side. We feel we have a great hand. But as we look to grow our streaming business, we believe there will be opportunities and even a need for us to do some selective investing outside the United States, notably in EMEA and in APAC. We've slowed down our investment in those markets. And in fact, we're being careful about our overall investment until we get the technology right, until we improve the technology because clearly, if we can use technology to reduce churn, which we're already doing, then in reality, what we're doing is we're increasing return our investment in content.

So the pricing that we recently put into place, which has increased pricing, was actually designed to move more people in the AVOD direction because we know the ARPU and interest in it from advertisers and streaming has grown. I was supposed to disclose those AVOD numbers... Sure. Happy to take those, Bryan. You're right. In domestic, we certainly feel like the consumer is strengthening. As I mentioned earlier, we obviously saw growth in domestic parks and certainly feel very positively about that. And that's our expectation going forward, is a gradual strengthening in the consumer. Regarding international, two factors. Number one, the Olympics in Paris, that whenever there is an Olympics in the city that we have a park, we typically see an attendance hit, and that's exactly what we saw. We saw that coming, which is why we indicated that to you back on the Q3 call in terms of our expectation. In addition to that, we saw some consumer softness in Shanghai. Candidly, we expect that to be temporary, and we expect that to bounce back as well. But it was nothing that should be concerning for the long-term regarding the parks. Regarding international subs, no, nothing chunky. This was good solid additions to the subscriber base in international. So we came off of Q3 and obviously had considerable success in adding subs in Q4."

            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Hi, Ben, it's Hugh. Obviously, for Experiences of why we guided to six to eight for the year, Q1 will be negatively impacted, of course, by the combination of the two hurricanes as well as the prelaunch cost for the Treasure. So Q1 will be negative. As we move through the course of the year, we'll move to positive in Q2 and then see further strengthening over the course of the year. The drivers on that are, number one, obviously, the Treasure is coming in, and we'll see continued strengthening from that. Number two, are we overlap our Q4 labor cost in Disneyland Resort. So that will be a positive from a lapse perspective. And then number three, we do expect the consumer to gradually strengthen through the course of the year. We also know that the bookings that we have in the back half of the year are positive right now. So we're optimistic about how bookings are looking as we get into the back half of next year. So hopefully, that's helpful. Sorry. So yes, Jessica, I'll add to that as well. As you know, in 2024, advertising were 3%. We expect to be at or stronger than that as we enter 2025. As Bob mentioned, in particular, the ad tech stack that we've put together or our ability to deliver the right ads more effectively to consumers, particularly in the streaming business, is a competitive advantage that we've built. And it's owned and is proprietary to Disney. So we certainly feel optimistic about our ability to gain share in advertising based on that. Yes. And Robert, in terms of your answer on confidence around achieving the double-digit margins, it's probably best to sort of go back to the building blocks as to how we get there. Number one, we're looking to continue to grow subscribers as we have. And the thing I'd remind you of in that regard, given the point that we're in many ways that the DTC business shares a lot of the characteristics of a software business where an incremental subscriber has very, very high margins attached to them because it's relatively low incremental cost. So continuing to grow subscribers, number one. Number two, we certainly look to continue to increase pricing in line with the value that we're providing to consumers. And a lot of the growth that we're seeing right now is because of the exceptional content that's coming out of both the movie and the TV studios that's obviously our proprietary content. So that will certainly enable us to increase pricing over time. Number three, as Bob mentioned, a lot of Adam's priorities around product updates and features that will increase engagement and reduce churn, including improving the recommendation engine, is certainly going to be a benefit to our growth, increasing our ad monetization, as I was just discussing with the ad tech that we've built. And then, of course, international is \u2013 continues to be a significant opportunity. So add all of that together, we wouldn't give any of the guidance that we did if we didn't have confidence in delivering. Sure. So why don't I handle the guide? In terms of the way that we're thinking about it, it's really driven by a couple of things. Number one is obviously the significant improvement in DTC, where we've invested a considerable amount of money in building that product. And number two, it's in light of the significant investments that we've made and are going to continue to make in parks and cruise ships and in \u2013 even in consumer products. So as we thought about those investments, we've obviously talked about the results that we've seen. And we feel very, very positively about those results. But we thought it was also very fair to give to investors not just operational results, but an expectation as to what we expect these investments to return, hence, the guidance rather than just focus it on the narrow pieces, although we've given you, I think, good segment detail, we thought it was also important to give you a picture of the overall company. So philosophically, because we've invested, we do feel like it's appropriate for us to give you a multiyear look because these investments are obviously multiyear in nature. In terms of our confidence in delivering it, obviously, we've got confidence in it. Otherwise, we wouldn't do it. We know it's important to deliver the guidance that we give, and that's why we've given it. So as it relates to flagship, I think it's a bit early to be talking about ARPU on flagship. We do think that product will be additive to us in 2026. And yes, there'll be an investment, then that's part of the 2025 guide. But that investment, we're looking to pay back relatively quickly in 2026. Got it. And John, I'll answer the divestiture piece as well as your question on Epic. Regarding divestitures, one of the first things I did when I came in as CFO of PepsiCo was to take a look at whether there was an opportunity here to create value through divestitures. And candidly, I just didn't see one, and I spent a considerable amount of time studying it first from a financial perspective. And it's always easy to sort of play with spreadsheets and sort of make the math look like there's value creation. But at the end of the day, there's two things to consider. Number one is, what are the prices you would get? And then number two, what's the frictional cost operationally of separating those assets? And as I went through the math on both, it was pretty clear to me that there wasn't a value-creating opportunity for Disney. I can't speak to other companies and what opportunities they have with the assets they have. But I absolutely did not see that for Disney. Regarding Epic, we did model that into our expectations for the experiences outlook. As I mentioned earlier, the early bookings that we have next summer are actually positive. So that's certainly a positive indicator. We also looked at the history of other attractions opening up and other parks opening up in Florida. And it's generally been beneficial to us. So that is all very much captured in the guide that we provided. Yes, Mike. And just to add to Bob's comments on that, we have modeled in some incremental growth in content spend, not enough to be significantly disruptive to the overall cash flow or algorithm for the company, but we have absolutely modeled that in because we do view international as a terrific opportunity. Regarding your question on Experiences and particularly the parks pricing versus attendance, what we projected in is a balance of both. So I don't want to get into specific numbers on it. But we're not assuming it's going to be just price or it's just going to be attendance. There'll be a balance of both. And frankly, we'll have the ability to flex that as we learn our way into it. But I think we've got it modeled reasonably conservatively. I'll handle that one, David. Regarding linear, we modeled that it would continue to decline. The beauty of the position we find ourselves in right now with roughly 175 million streaming consumers is we have a bit of a natural hedge in the way that our portfolio operates. So to the degree that people leave linear and choose to go to streaming route, generally speaking, they're going to be coming our way. And we have obviously terrific ways to monetize those. So as that evolves based on consumer choice, I think we're well positioned if they decide to stay in linear for longer. I think we're well positioned if they decide to move over to the streaming side. And frankly, with what we've put on the service and what \u2013 the plans that we have to put more things on the service, I think in many ways, we're sort of a must-have platform inside of most households. Regarding DirecTV, like all of these deals, they're basically uniquely crafted to the situation of that particular partner. So I wouldn't try to read through any of that into any other deals. I think it's a good deal for us. I think it's a good deal for them, and we both feel good about where we've gone. But I think these things are generally going to be somewhat bespoke. Sure. Happy to address those. Regarding streaming, we expect our growth to come from a balance of pricing as well as growth. It may tilt slightly towards pricing. And again, we're going to read the market, and we can react to it as it plays out. But our expectation right now is it will be both subs and pricing, a little bit more tilted towards pricing. Regarding local content, I'm not sure I have much more to add to what Bob had already mentioned, which is we do see it as valuable. We actually do a reasonable amount of that already, particularly in APAC with some of the Korean dramas that we do, and we also do some in Latin America. But as Bob mentioned, we don't want to invest too heavily there until we feel like we're comfortable with the product such that we'll have the churn operating at right levels. So that's my expectation. Yes, happy to address that. We're very, very excited about the deal with Reliance. Obviously, they're a terrific company and have huge presence in India. Going forward, we will have a percentage ownership... We'll have a percentage ownership in the high 30s. And obviously, the Reliance people with their share of ownership will be managing the business. In terms of the specific implications on Disney's financials, we did anticipate closing. We've got it included in the guidance. To the degree that you have more detailed questions around that, I'm sure the Investor Relations team can help you model that out."

[Operator Instructions] After some brief introductory remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Our press release, Form 10-Q and management's prepared remarks were issued earlier this morning and are available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast and a replay and transcript as well as the third quarter earnings presentation will all be made available on our website after the call. As we previously announced, today's call will follow a new format consisting only of a question-and-answer session. Joining me this morning are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As we start the Q&A session, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many analysts as possible today. And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Yes, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. I'm going to try to squeeze in two, one on theme parks and one on NBA. So first on theme parks, there's really a lot of moving pieces here. Can you provide color on global park demand and where you expect this protracted weakness? Maybe include the benefit from cruise ships, since you have three ships coming on over the next, I guess, 18 months or so. And with the stated fiscal Q4 mid-single-digit decline and the expectation that this will last for several quarters, is that the right level to think about OI as we think about fiscal '25? And on the NBA, with the rights now complete, you'll likely have several hundred million dollar step-up when the new contract begins in fiscal '26. Are there incremental monetization drivers, including maybe WNBA growth that can make the new contract profitable in the early years? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Great. Thanks, Jessica. This is Hugh. Good morning. That was a six-part first question. So I'll try to answer it as best I can. First, just to sort of peel apart Q3 again. I want to emphasize we actually had 2% revenue growth in Q3. The reason, obviously, is the IP is so strong in our parks. It really does attract a strong audience and people are reluctant to cancel vacations. So while we saw a slight moderation in demand, I certainly wouldn't call it a significant change. That said 40% of the Experiences business is actually not domestic parks. It's either international parks or consumer products and that's from an operating income perspective. 60% is domestic parks, including cruise ships. Within that, we saw attendance flat in the quarter and we saw per caps up a little bit. We expect to see a flattish revenue number in Q4 coming out of the parks. And as we mentioned in, earlier in the letter, really just a few quarters. So I don't think I'd refer to it as protracted, but just a couple of quarters of likely similar results. Now, keep in mind, we do have some expenses attached to our ships coming in and that will affect us a bit in '24 and a bit in '25. But overall I would just call this as a bit of a slowdown that's being more than offset by the entertainment business both what we've seen so far and our expectations for Moana 2 as well as Mufasa.\nRobert Iger: Regarding the NBA deal, Jessica, first of all, let me just remind you and everyone that the deal doesn't kick in next year, it's a year later. We have one more year on the current deal. And as we looked at it, first of all, one goal was to maintain what we'll call the A package, which means we've got the finals for 11 more years or now we have the finals for 12 years and they drive significant value for us. Also, overall, the deal reflects the value of live programming. We know that that's been an advertiser's delight and also an audience's delight. It also reflects the growing value of basketball and the growing value of women's sports. There's a large WNBA component to this. Also as part of this deal and has been the strategy of ESPN for a while to lock in sports rights for a long period of time. It secures our ability to bring ESPN in the digital direction, particularly as we look to launch flagship sometime at the end of 2025. So we believe that by the time this kicks in and a year from now that a lot of the pieces will be in place in terms of driving more advertising revenue, more distribution revenue, moving to digital. And another thing that we've done here is we've secured international rights, particularly to the finals, not in every market around the world, but in most markets. And that will drive some added revenue as well. Not going to be specific about the profitability in the early years, but there's tremendous value in this deal.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Ben Swinburne at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe for Bob. I wanted to ask you about sort of the outlook for Disney+ both in the context of where the product's going, but also how this becomes a significant earnings contributor to the company as you look ahead. We look at the product, it's really broadening. You've got obviously brought in Hulu. Now you're adding news. A lot of sports, ESPN coming in. You've added the international NBA rights to the product overseas. What's the vision here? And in your mind, does it support both continued subscriber growth and pricing power? I think there's probably some concern out there that the recent price increases might face some consumer pushback. So I'd love to get your thoughts on that big topic. And then just wanted to clarify, Hugh, when you say flattish revenue, Q4, are you talking about at the Experiences segment level or is that just the domestic parks comment? Just wanted to clarify. Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Let me start by saying that what we've been seeing with streaming is significant success, driven largely by the success of our creativity, whether it's in the television side. The company had 183 Emmy Nominations, for instance, led by shows like Shogun and The Bear and Abbott Elementary and Only Murders in the Building. And I can go on and on. And obviously on top of the television success creatively, we've had huge success in the motion picture front recently. And when you look at what the current motion picture lineup drives in terms of value on streaming, it's profound. So Inside Out, as it's in our comments today, the first film has had tremendous consumption since the first trailer for Inside Out 2 launched in November. The same thing is true for the early Deadpool movies, for the early Planet of the Apes movies, I could go on and on. So when we look across our portfolio of IP, and this includes Disney branded, Fox branded, obviously everything that's on Hulu, programming from FX, programming from ABC, National Geographic, what we're basically seeing is we're seeing growth in consumption and the popularity of our offerings, which gives us the pricing leverage that we believe we have. So every time we've taken a price increase, we've had only modest churn from that. Nothing that we would consider significant. We believe that as we add these new features like the channels that we're going to be adding later this year that and the success of our movie slate, and I'll get into that a little bit more, that the pricing leverage that we have is actually increased. We're not concerned. The goal is to grow engagement on the platform. And what I mean by that is obviously offering a wider variety of programming, which is why we're adding news, why we're adding the ESPN tile to it, while we're bundling aggressively to give consumers the ability to buy across all of our basically creative engines. And we feel very bullish about the future of this business. We're not saying much more about it, except you can expect that it's going to grow nicely in fiscal 2025. The other thing I want to add is that we've been talking a lot about adding the technology features that we need to basically make it a higher return, a higher margin business and a more successful business. And we're doing that right now. We started our password sharing initiative in June. That kicks in, in earnest in September. By the way, we've had no backlash at all to the notifications that have gone out and to the work that we've already been doing. We know that we need stronger recommendation engines and we're working on that technology and we need to make our marketing more efficient. But by adding all of these features, both on the technological side and also on the programming side, we're bullish about the future of this business. And then when you think about it over to Hugh mentioned Moana and Mufasa, let me just read to you the movies that we'll be making and releasing in the next almost two years. We have Moana, Mufasa, Captain America, Snow White, Thunderbolts, Fantastic Four, Zootopia, Avatar, Avengers, Mandalorian, and Toy Story, just to name a few. And when you think about not only the potential of those in box office, but the potential of those to drive global streaming value, I think, there's a reason to be bullish about where we're headed.\nHugh Johnston: And Ben to answer your other question, flattish was a reference to Experiences.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, ma'am. Our next question today comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Thank you. Bob, as you think about the future of content spending for Disney, especially after the NBA deal and all the content that you're just talking about now. What is the right balance of investment between sports, scripted TV and movies going forward? And then for Hugh, can you just update us on free cash flow expectations this year with one quarter to go and how to think about the parks impact and the content spending on free cash flow in '25? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Well, we obviously are investing significantly in all directions because of the value that it creates and also because of the value that it represents to our future in streaming. We talked about sports, the long-term deals that we've made. Obviously, College Football is part of that. And on top of the NBA, on top of the NFL, on the movie side, we've talked a lot about our the creative improvements that our studio has brought to bear and the quality of the IP and the known quality of our IP. And television, I can't say enough about how great our television businesses have been performing both in terms of the bottom line, but also in terms of creatively. You don't get 183 Emmy Nominations by accident. That's the work of a lot of really great, talented people, meaning on the management side, working with a lot of talented, creative people. So it's a balance, it's a mix and I think it's one that you'll ultimately see really blended together as our streaming platform grows over time.\nHugh Johnston: And, Robert, on free cash flow. We had previously guided to $8 billion. We don't have any news on that, but if there were a material change on it, obviously we would have changed the guide.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. So, Hugh, you talked about DTC getting to double-digit margins with the big price increases and the paid sharing efforts coming. I was wondering if you could just update us on your thinking. We'd love to get some timing around double-digit margins if that's something you're comfortable with at this point, but any context would be helpful. And then just on parks, as we think about cruise ship pre-opening costs in there, what's implied in the fourth quarter and as we think about cruise pre-opening costs in fiscal '25, what do those look like? I think you'll sail the Treasure, but you've still got the Adventure and the Destiny. I think the Singapore dock is a little heavier on cost, so we just love to understand that component. Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Happy to talk about both. In terms of the journey on getting to double-digit margins, the levers haven't changed and frankly we're actually doing quite well with them. Bundling has had a positive impact on churn. So from that perspective, obviously, that helps us with growth, which is one of the drivers. Password-sharing is just starting to roll out. That's also going to be helpful in terms of driving growth. We've announced pricing and we feel good with all of the value that we're providing to consumers. With all the creative that Bob mentioned earlier and all the creative that's still to come. We do feel like we've earned that pricing in the marketplace and we feel positively about that. With that will come scale benefits. The product improvements also should reduce churn and keep our consumers with us as they're evaluating their options. And then obviously we're going to look at the entire cost structure and continue to drive productivity. In terms of timing, no update on that. It's something that we've said we are approaching with great urgency. We still intend to do that. Obviously, I think, we've made a ton of progress. We were losing $1 billion a quarter not all that long ago and now we're making money and our expectation is we're going to continue on that journey to making more money to get to and then ultimately well surpass the double-digit margins that we've talked about. Regarding the cruise ships, we've shared a number for this year. The number will be a little over double that in terms of the startup costs in 2025. So you can assume that, that'll be about that. That said, the cruise ships tend to pay back very quickly. So we certainly feel positive about those investments.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. On Sports, Bob wanted to see if you could update on strategic partner conversations for ESPN. Is this still a priority? And if so, can you refresh on what you're looking for in terms of marketing or content? And then for Hugh, in the exact commentary, there's multiple references to tightly managing costs. So I wanted to see if you could expand on this, where you're realizing savings now, how much opportunities left? Thanks.\nRobert Iger: I know I've sounded like a broken record because I've talked about strategic partnerships for ESPN over the last number of quarters. The only thing I can say is, believe it or not, we're still having conversations about it. We thought and continue to believe there may be opportunities to partner with others, particularly on the content side, and that's why we've continued to explore it. But nothing more to add.\nHugh Johnston: Right. And regarding cost, recall, our original cost estimate was $5.5 billion. We raised that to in excess of $7.5 billion. Look, in big companies, my worldview is there's always opportunity to do more with less. So we're going to continue to go after it aggressively as we can to both deliver the bottom line and to invest back in the business with all the great opportunities we have.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Maybe first on the parks. Any further details in terms of the softening and the flat revenues that you expect for 4Q and looking out into '25. I mean, do you expect attendance to continue to soften or potentially turn negative and just any commentary on what you're seeing or expectations are on the per cap side? And then secondly, Venu launches this fall, just any expectations in terms of what it could do to trend in the linear business for you guys? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah, I'll take that. In terms of the parks business, I've kind of given you a lot of our expectation already. I'm not sure I'm ready to peel it down to attendance versus per caps. I think, again, we're going to be pretty consistent with what we saw in Q3. And we talked about the fact that the lower income consumer is feeling a little bit of stress. The high income consumer is traveling internationally a bit more. I think you're just going to see more of a continuation of those trends in terms of the top line. And then the bottom line will be reflective of the fact that we've got some one-time costs coming in and going out both this year and last year. I do expect to see international strengthen. Disneyland Paris has obviously felt some challenge due to the Olympics. Not a surprise, but something that happens. And the good news is the Olympics are over in a couple of weeks and the booking will certainly look good in that regard. So overall feeling positively on that front.\nAlexia Quadrani: Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, ma'am. Our next question comes from Michael Morris at Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask you on ARPU at domestic Disney+. It did slip a little bit in the quarter and you cited the impact of subscriber mix shift. Are you saying that that's a function of bundling in terms of mix shift or is it mix shift to the ad-supported tier? And if so, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the CTV environment, how you're performing there? And just one follow-up on the Experiences segment. We generally think of parks vacations as being booked pretty well in advance. So it was a little bit surprising to hear about demand moderation within the quarter. So can you help us a little bit with how much visibility you feel like you have? And if it does vary by quarter, if there's maybe less advanced bookings in certain quarters versus others? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. To answer the question on ARPU, you hit both points correctly. Number one, bundling has a small effect. And then in addition to that, the shift to the ad model certainly has a small effect as well. From a profitability standpoint, we're pretty happy with whether people choose the ad model or the ad-free model. Regarding visibility, we do have very good visibility, which is why I'm emphasizing. These are really all changes at the margins, daily visitors and late bookers and things like that. Looking forward, we have very good visibility into the book that we're expecting, which is why I've got a good level of confidence in the projections that I'm sharing with you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Bryan Kraft at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft: Hi. Good morning. I had two if I could. Just first on advertising. You highlighted the strong results from the upfront this year, which is very encouraging. But I wanted to ask what you're seeing more immediately in terms of advertising demand today, given some of the macro pressures that have recently come to light. Are advertisers becoming more cautious? Are you seeing that in more in the real-time ad sales part of the business? And then just on the content sales and licensing part of the business, the press release mentioned increased sales of TV content and content sales, licensing, and other as a driver of the OI performance this quarter, along with the box office of course. Is there anything to read into this? Is it the beginning of a trend toward increasing content licensing to third parties or is just a timing benefit or one-off? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Happy to talk about it. Ad market is actually very healthy right now. We saw overall advertising grow 8% for the quarter. ESPN was up 17%, DTC streaming was actually up 20%. So certainly feeling very, very positively in that regard. And in terms of the categories, financial services, consumer products doing very well, consumer services doing very well and technology doing very well. Auto is a little bit softer in that regard. But overall, the ad market is really, really strong and healthy for us. And a lot of that is a product of the fact that we have live sports and the fact that our streaming service is doing so well in terms of the IP that we have. It's an attractive audience. We also have a new capability called Disney Streaming that allows us to basically sell across our platforms very effectively. We're selling audiences rather than just selling streaming channels, which enables advertisers to more effectively target the audiences that they're seeking. So from a technology perspective, we're seeing good payback. The second piece was around licensing. Yeah, the licensing numbers that you see are mostly a reality around the fact that we've had so much success at the box office. That's really what's driving things more than anything else. No change in our licensing strategy, which has been pretty clear. The things that we consider core IP to the company, we don't license. There are things that are non-strategic. We'll continue to license tactically. But it's not a big strategy for us. The big strategy is producing our own IP and monetizing it.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Yes, ma'am. Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So maybe in theme parks, I mean, there's a few growth elements I guess over the next few years in terms of cruise ships and broadly other CapEx investments that you're making in the parks. Maybe if you could just step back and talk about what kind of growth impact you expect, maybe over the next two or three years, and if that can offset to what extent that can offset some of the weakness you're seeing in the parks, that would be useful. And then one other segment which probably goes out of your numbers next year is India. And that's been a loss-making business. So to the extent you can talk about the potential earnings contribution once India is deconsolidated that would be much appreciated. Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. Good morning, Kannan. Two things. One, obviously, the investments that we're making into the Experiences business, we feel very, very good about it. It's been a great returning business for a long time. So while I'm not here to give you long-term guidance in terms of that segment of the business. We wouldn't be making capital investments in an accelerated way if we didn't expect to accelerate growth out of those businesses and that's true of the cruise ships as well. Now, keep in mind, that the lead time on investments in this business are multiple years. So when exactly all of that manifests, we'll share with you as we go along. But, obviously, we're investing because we're looking to accelerate growth and hence the term turbocharge. Regarding the India question, we will share that when we close the deal. I think that's the right time to do it. And we'll lay it out for you all very clearly so that you can model it very, very effectively.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the questions and I want to thank everyone for joining us today.\nOperator: Note that a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that were referred to on this call to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found on our Investor Relations website.

            "name": "Robert Iger",
            "content": "Regarding the NBA deal, Jessica, first of all, let me just remind you and everyone that the deal doesn't kick in next year, it's a year later. We have one more year on the current deal. And as we looked at it, first of all, one goal was to maintain what we'll call the A package, which means we've got the finals for 11 more years or now we have the finals for 12 years and they drive significant value for us. Also, overall, the deal reflects the value of live programming. We know that that's been an advertiser's delight and also an audience's delight. It also reflects the growing value of basketball and the growing value of women's sports. There's a large WNBA component to this. Also as part of this deal and has been the strategy of ESPN for a while to lock in sports rights for a long period of time. It secures our ability to bring ESPN in the digital direction, particularly as we look to launch flagship sometime at the end of 2025. So we believe that by the time this kicks in and a year from now that a lot of the pieces will be in place in terms of driving more advertising revenue, more distribution revenue, moving to digital. And another thing that we've done here is we've secured international rights, particularly to the finals, not in every market around the world, but in most markets. And that will drive some added revenue as well. Not going to be specific about the profitability in the early years, but there's tremendous value in this deal. Let me start by saying that what we've been seeing with streaming is significant success, driven largely by the success of our creativity, whether it's in the television side. The company had 183 Emmy Nominations, for instance, led by shows like Shogun and The Bear and Abbott Elementary and Only Murders in the Building. And I can go on and on. And obviously on top of the television success creatively, we've had huge success in the motion picture front recently. And when you look at what the current motion picture lineup drives in terms of value on streaming, it's profound. So Inside Out, as it's in our comments today, the first film has had tremendous consumption since the first trailer for Inside Out 2 launched in November. The same thing is true for the early Deadpool movies, for the early Planet of the Apes movies, I could go on and on. So when we look across our portfolio of IP, and this includes Disney branded, Fox branded, obviously everything that's on Hulu, programming from FX, programming from ABC, National Geographic, what we're basically seeing is we're seeing growth in consumption and the popularity of our offerings, which gives us the pricing leverage that we believe we have. So every time we've taken a price increase, we've had only modest churn from that. Nothing that we would consider significant. We believe that as we add these new features like the channels that we're going to be adding later this year that and the success of our movie slate, and I'll get into that a little bit more, that the pricing leverage that we have is actually increased. We're not concerned. The goal is to grow engagement on the platform. And what I mean by that is obviously offering a wider variety of programming, which is why we're adding news, why we're adding the ESPN tile to it, while we're bundling aggressively to give consumers the ability to buy across all of our basically creative engines. And we feel very bullish about the future of this business. We're not saying much more about it, except you can expect that it's going to grow nicely in fiscal 2025. The other thing I want to add is that we've been talking a lot about adding the technology features that we need to basically make it a higher return, a higher margin business and a more successful business. And we're doing that right now. We started our password sharing initiative in June. That kicks in, in earnest in September. By the way, we've had no backlash at all to the notifications that have gone out and to the work that we've already been doing. We know that we need stronger recommendation engines and we're working on that technology and we need to make our marketing more efficient. But by adding all of these features, both on the technological side and also on the programming side, we're bullish about the future of this business. And then when you think about it over to Hugh mentioned Moana and Mufasa, let me just read to you the movies that we'll be making and releasing in the next almost two years. We have Moana, Mufasa, Captain America, Snow White, Thunderbolts, Fantastic Four, Zootopia, Avatar, Avengers, Mandalorian, and Toy Story, just to name a few. And when you think about not only the potential of those in box office, but the potential of those to drive global streaming value, I think, there's a reason to be bullish about where we're headed. Well, we obviously are investing significantly in all directions because of the value that it creates and also because of the value that it represents to our future in streaming. We talked about sports, the long-term deals that we've made. Obviously, College Football is part of that. And on top of the NBA, on top of the NFL, on the movie side, we've talked a lot about our the creative improvements that our studio has brought to bear and the quality of the IP and the known quality of our IP. And television, I can't say enough about how great our television businesses have been performing both in terms of the bottom line, but also in terms of creatively. You don't get 183 Emmy Nominations by accident. That's the work of a lot of really great, talented people, meaning on the management side, working with a lot of talented, creative people. So it's a balance, it's a mix and I think it's one that you'll ultimately see really blended together as our streaming platform grows over time. I know I've sounded like a broken record because I've talked about strategic partnerships for ESPN over the last number of quarters. The only thing I can say is, believe it or not, we're still having conversations about it. We thought and continue to believe there may be opportunities to partner with others, particularly on the content side, and that's why we've continued to explore it. But nothing more to add."

            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Jessica. This is Hugh. Good morning. That was a six-part first question. So I'll try to answer it as best I can. First, just to sort of peel apart Q3 again. I want to emphasize we actually had 2% revenue growth in Q3. The reason, obviously, is the IP is so strong in our parks. It really does attract a strong audience and people are reluctant to cancel vacations. So while we saw a slight moderation in demand, I certainly wouldn't call it a significant change. That said 40% of the Experiences business is actually not domestic parks. It's either international parks or consumer products and that's from an operating income perspective. 60% is domestic parks, including cruise ships. Within that, we saw attendance flat in the quarter and we saw per caps up a little bit. We expect to see a flattish revenue number in Q4 coming out of the parks. And as we mentioned in, earlier in the letter, really just a few quarters. So I don't think I'd refer to it as protracted, but just a couple of quarters of likely similar results. Now, keep in mind, we do have some expenses attached to our ships coming in and that will affect us a bit in '24 and a bit in '25. But overall I would just call this as a bit of a slowdown that's being more than offset by the entertainment business both what we've seen so far and our expectations for Moana 2 as well as Mufasa. And Ben to answer your other question, flattish was a reference to Experiences. And, Robert, on free cash flow. We had previously guided to $8 billion. We don't have any news on that, but if there were a material change on it, obviously we would have changed the guide. Sure. Happy to talk about both. In terms of the journey on getting to double-digit margins, the levers haven't changed and frankly we're actually doing quite well with them. Bundling has had a positive impact on churn. So from that perspective, obviously, that helps us with growth, which is one of the drivers. Password-sharing is just starting to roll out. That's also going to be helpful in terms of driving growth. We've announced pricing and we feel good with all of the value that we're providing to consumers. With all the creative that Bob mentioned earlier and all the creative that's still to come. We do feel like we've earned that pricing in the marketplace and we feel positively about that. With that will come scale benefits. The product improvements also should reduce churn and keep our consumers with us as they're evaluating their options. And then obviously we're going to look at the entire cost structure and continue to drive productivity. In terms of timing, no update on that. It's something that we've said we are approaching with great urgency. We still intend to do that. Obviously, I think, we've made a ton of progress. We were losing $1 billion a quarter not all that long ago and now we're making money and our expectation is we're going to continue on that journey to making more money to get to and then ultimately well surpass the double-digit margins that we've talked about. Regarding the cruise ships, we've shared a number for this year. The number will be a little over double that in terms of the startup costs in 2025. So you can assume that, that'll be about that. That said, the cruise ships tend to pay back very quickly. So we certainly feel positive about those investments. Right. And regarding cost, recall, our original cost estimate was $5.5 billion. We raised that to in excess of $7.5 billion. Look, in big companies, my worldview is there's always opportunity to do more with less. So we're going to continue to go after it aggressively as we can to both deliver the bottom line and to invest back in the business with all the great opportunities we have. Yeah, I'll take that. In terms of the parks business, I've kind of given you a lot of our expectation already. I'm not sure I'm ready to peel it down to attendance versus per caps. I think, again, we're going to be pretty consistent with what we saw in Q3. And we talked about the fact that the lower income consumer is feeling a little bit of stress. The high income consumer is traveling internationally a bit more. I think you're just going to see more of a continuation of those trends in terms of the top line. And then the bottom line will be reflective of the fact that we've got some one-time costs coming in and going out both this year and last year. I do expect to see international strengthen. Disneyland Paris has obviously felt some challenge due to the Olympics. Not a surprise, but something that happens. And the good news is the Olympics are over in a couple of weeks and the booking will certainly look good in that regard. So overall feeling positively on that front. Yeah. To answer the question on ARPU, you hit both points correctly. Number one, bundling has a small effect. And then in addition to that, the shift to the ad model certainly has a small effect as well. From a profitability standpoint, we're pretty happy with whether people choose the ad model or the ad-free model. Regarding visibility, we do have very good visibility, which is why I'm emphasizing. These are really all changes at the margins, daily visitors and late bookers and things like that. Looking forward, we have very good visibility into the book that we're expecting, which is why I've got a good level of confidence in the projections that I'm sharing with you. Sure. Happy to talk about it. Ad market is actually very healthy right now. We saw overall advertising grow 8% for the quarter. ESPN was up 17%, DTC streaming was actually up 20%. So certainly feeling very, very positively in that regard. And in terms of the categories, financial services, consumer products doing very well, consumer services doing very well and technology doing very well. Auto is a little bit softer in that regard. But overall, the ad market is really, really strong and healthy for us. And a lot of that is a product of the fact that we have live sports and the fact that our streaming service is doing so well in terms of the IP that we have. It's an attractive audience. We also have a new capability called Disney Streaming that allows us to basically sell across our platforms very effectively. We're selling audiences rather than just selling streaming channels, which enables advertisers to more effectively target the audiences that they're seeking. So from a technology perspective, we're seeing good payback. The second piece was around licensing. Yeah, the licensing numbers that you see are mostly a reality around the fact that we've had so much success at the box office. That's really what's driving things more than anything else. No change in our licensing strategy, which has been pretty clear. The things that we consider core IP to the company, we don't license. There are things that are non-strategic. We'll continue to license tactically. But it's not a big strategy for us. The big strategy is producing our own IP and monetizing it. Yeah. Good morning, Kannan. Two things. One, obviously, the investments that we're making into the Experiences business, we feel very, very good about it. It's been a great returning business for a long time. So while I'm not here to give you long-term guidance in terms of that segment of the business. We wouldn't be making capital investments in an accelerated way if we didn't expect to accelerate growth out of those businesses and that's true of the cruise ships as well. Now, keep in mind, that the lead time on investments in this business are multiple years. So when exactly all of that manifests, we'll share with you as we go along. But, obviously, we're investing because we're looking to accelerate growth and hence the term turbocharge. Regarding the India question, we will share that when we close the deal. I think that's the right time to do it. And we'll lay it out for you all very clearly so that you can model it very, very effectively."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Walt Disney Company's Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nAlexia Quadrani: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued earlier this morning and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript as well as the second quarter earnings presentation will all be made available on our website after the call.\n Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Hugh, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started. \nRobert Iger: Thank you, Alexia, and good morning, everyone. Our strong performance in Q2 demonstrates we are delivering on our strategic priorities while building for the future. Overall, this was another impressive quarter for us with adjusted earnings per share up 30% compared to prior year. And I'm pleased to say this outperformance raises our full year adjusted EPS growth target to 25%.\n Our results were driven in large part by our Experiences segment and our streaming business, which achieved an important milestone with the entertainment portion of the streaming business, achieving profitability in the quarter. This is a testament to the turnaround we set in motion last year and the outstanding leadership of Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman, Alan Bergman and Dana Walden. It is particularly noteworthy when you consider we reported peak losses only 18 months ago.\n We also remain on track to reach profitability in our combined streaming businesses in Q4. We've said all along our path to profitability will not be linear. And while we are anticipating a softer third quarter due in large part to the seasonality of our India sports offerings, we fully expect streaming to be a growth driver for the company in the future and we have prioritized the steps necessary to achieve this.\n In March, we successfully launched Hulu on Disney+, bringing extensive general entertainment content to the platform for bundled subscribers, and we're encouraged by the early results. And by the end of this calendar year, we will be adding an ESPN title to Disney+ giving all U.S. subscribers access to select live games and studio programming within the Disney+ app. We see this as a first step to bring ESPN to Disney+ viewers as we ready the launch of our enhanced stand-alone ESPN streaming service in the fall of 2025.\n The key to our success in streaming and what consistently brings consumers back for more is the array of exceptional content we produce that captivates audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Looking at our film studios. We have a number of highly anticipated theatrical releases arriving over the next few months, including Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, which opens this Friday, as well as Pixar's Inside Out 2, Marvel's Deadpool and Wolverine and 20th Century Studios, Alien: Romulus, which are all slated for this summer.\n Later this year, we're looking forward to Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King. And in 2025, our slate remains just as robust with Captain America: Brave New World, Fantastic Four, Elio, Zootopia 2 and Avatar 3. Our series also continued to resonate with audiences and critics alike. FX's Shogun has proven to be a global hit, with success on both linear and streaming. It's tracking as FX's most watched show ever on our streaming platforms, and it's driving the second largest number of sign-ups to our streaming services since 2022, behind only Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. This is a great example of how we are successfully reaching wider audiences with our combined linear and streaming ecosystem.\n In Q2, series that aired on linear networks accounted for 17 of the top 20 most viewed series on our streaming platforms with almost 3 billion hours of consumption. Our linear channels are deeply embedded in our direct-to-consumer strategy as they continue to deliver high-quality content that reaches demographics not captured on streaming alone, allowing us to broaden our audiences and leverage our unmatched content engine across an expansive base.\n Turning to ESPN. Sports continues to stand out when it comes to convening large audiences with recent big ratings wins across a variety of sports. ESPN had a fantastic April in terms of total day viewership, the highest April since 2012. For Primetime viewership, it was ESPN's highest April on record. The NCAA Women's Final Four in Cleveland was the most viewed on record and the championship between Iowa and South Carolina was ESPN's most viewed college basketball game ever, men's or women's.\n We also saw record-breaking ratings for the WNBA draft. Monday Night Football had its most watched season since 2000, and the NFL postseason also broke viewership records. The divisional playoff game between the Houston Texans and Baltimore Ravens was ESPN's most watched NFL game ever with 32.4 million viewers. Looking at our experiences business, which remained an impressive financial driver in the quarter, we are focused on turbocharging growth with a number of long-term strategic investments.\n That includes our Disneyland Forward initiative the first step in our expansion plans at Disneyland Resort, which received unanimous preliminary approval by the Anaheim City Council last month. This was a significant milestone and the final vote is expected to take place this evening. We're incredibly excited for the many potential new stories our guests could experience at Walt's original theme park including the much anticipated opportunity to bring Avatar to Disneyland.\n When you consider all of our businesses as a whole, from entertainment, to sports, to experiences, it's clear that no one has what Disney has. The turnaround and growth initiatives we set in motion last year have continued to yield positive results, and we are executing against our ambitious strategic priorities with both speed and determination.\n To walk you through more of our results from the quarter, I will now turn things over to Hugh. \nHugh Johnston: Thanks, Bob. Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, for the second fiscal quarter were $1.21 and reflect the second quarter in a row of strong double-digit percentage year-over-year earnings growth. We also met or exceeded all of our financial guidance for the quarter. And as Bob mentioned, we are now targeting adjusted EPS growth of 25% for the full year.\n At our Entertainment segment, second quarter operating income increased by over 70% versus prior year, driven by direct-to-consumer. Entertainment DTC revenue increased 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year and generated operating income of $47 million. These results exceeded our guidance primarily due to expense savings. Core Disney+ subscribers increased by $6.3 million in the quarter, reflecting nearly 8 million additions domestically driven by charter entitlements and a slight loss internationally from the impacts of wholesale deal changes and price increases.\n Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by 6% or $0.44 reflecting price increases for the domestic premium tier as well as international ARPU growth, partially offset by lower ad supported ARPU domestically, driven by dilution from charter entitlements. And the recent Charter deal also drove Disney+ ad tier subscriber growth in the quarter. We ended Q2 with 22.5 million ad tier subscribers globally. We are pleased with the progress we're making in streaming, although as we said before, the path to long-term profitability is not a linear one.\n On that note, we are forecasting a loss for entertainment DTC in the third quarter, the vast majority of which is due to Disney+ Hotstar's ICC Cricket rights. We also do not expect to see core subscriber growth at Disney+ in the third quarter, but anticipate sub growth will return in Q4.\n As Bob mentioned, we continue to expect our combined streaming businesses to be profitable in the fourth quarter and expect further improvements in profitability in fiscal 2025. At Entertainment linear networks, a decrease in operating income versus the prior year was primarily driven by lower affiliate and advertising revenue domestically and lower affiliate revenue internationally. And at content sales, licensing and other lower Q2 results versus the prior year reflect the absence of significant theatrical releases in the quarter.\n For Q3, we expect this business to generate modestly positive operating income, an improvement over the prior quarter and prior year. Moving to sports. Second quarter operating income decreased slightly versus the prior year, driven primarily by a decrease at ESPN, offset by improved results at Star India sports. As expected, at ESPN, lower results at the domestic business reflects higher programming and production costs from the timing of an additional college football playoff game in the quarter versus the prior year, which were only partially offset by higher ad revenue.\n Domestic affiliate revenue also decreased in the quarter. ESPN domestic ad sales increased by more than 20% versus the prior year or high single digits when adjusted for the college football playoff timing shift of an additional game as well as a new NFL divisional playoff game in Q2 of this year. Q3 to date, we are seeing healthy demand driven by the NBA playoffs and domestic ESPN cash ad sales are pacing up.\n At Star, higher results in Q2 versus the prior year include the impact of a decrease in programming and production costs attributable to the nonrenewal of BCCI cricket rights. Looking ahead, note that we are currently expecting to incur linear ICC rights expense at Star India in Q3. At Experiences, second quarter revenue grew 10%, operating income grew 12%, and segment margins expanded by 60 basis points versus the prior year. Parks and Experiences OI increased by 13% year-over-year and consumer products OI increased by 7%.\n Strong international Parks growth was driven by Hong Kong Disneyland Resort while Walt Disney World and the Cruise business both contributed to domestic growth. At Disneyland, despite growing attendance and per capita spend, results declined year-over-year due to cost inflation including from higher labor expenses. We continue to expect robust operating income growth that experiences for the full year. However, third quarter OI is expected to come in roughly comparable to the prior year.\n Several noncomparable or timing-related items are expected to adversely impact Q3 results, including timing of media and tech expenses, noncomparable items in the prior year at consumer products and the timing of Easter. Beyond these comparability related headwinds, the third quarter's results will be impacted by 3 additional factors, higher wage expenses, preopening expenses related to the Disney Treasure and Adventure Cruise ships as well as Disney Cruise Line's New Island Lookout Cay and some normalization of post-COVID demand.\n As it relates to demand, while consumers continue to travel in record numbers, and we are still seeing healthy demand, we are seeing some evidence of a global moderation from peak post-COVID travel. While pressures from wages, preopening costs and demand impacts are expected to persist in Q4, we do expect year-over-year experiences operating income growth to rebound significantly in the fourth quarter due to fewer comparability or timing factors.\n On an enterprise level, we continue to make good progress on our cost efficiency initiatives and remain positioned to exceed our $7.5 billion annualized target. We still expect to generate over $8 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year and the shareholder return goals we've previously spoken about are also still very much on track. We repurchased $1 billion of stock in the second quarter. We continue to position the company for long-term growth and profitability and are making tangible progress on generating compounding earnings and free cash flow growth, which will enable us to continue returning capital to shareholders.\n I'll now hand the call back to Alexia for Q&A. \nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Hugh. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. \nSteven Cahall: So first, thanks for that detail on Parks and Experiences and what you expect in the third quarter. I just wanted to dig into some of those demand comments a little more. So as you start to lap some of the post-COVID rebound, what's your expectation for attendance maybe at the domestic level and at the global level as you start to exit fiscal '24 and into '25?\n Do you think things will continue to be stable? Or are any of those softening trends sufficient that you expect attendance to have any kind of year-on-year declines? And then on the DTC side of things, Hugh, I think you've talked about a double-digit operating margin as the aspiration. I was wondering if you could just give us any timing as to when we can expect those types of margins? And maybe you could speak to the underlying performance of DTC excluding Hotstar since I think you're going to be consolidating that next year? \nRobert Iger: Great. Steve, happy to weigh in on both of those. First, in terms of attendance, what we're basically communicating is relative to the post-COVID highs, things are tending to normalize. The Parks business did 10% growth in the quarter. And obviously, that's an extremely high revenue number. That said, we still see in the bookings that we look ahead towards indicate healthy growth in the business.\n So we still certainly feel good about the opportunities for continued strong growth. In addition to that, just to comment a bit more on the timing. As I mentioned on the intro, we do have some onetime expenses occurring in Q3. If we were to back out one-timers both for Q3 and Q4, we expect OI for the quarter to be in the mid- to high single-digit range for Q3 and to be double digit for Q4.\n So certainly feel like the Parks business is still doing very, very well. Obviously, we've got the best in the business in terms of product and people still have a strong desire to basically go on vacation and come to see us.\n With regard to DTC margins, a couple of comments on that. First, our goal with this business is to make it a great growth business with healthy margins, right? We want both, not one versus the other. We've got a lot of levers that give us strong reasons to believe that there's good growth in front of us, whether it's the great programming we have, whether it's higher engagement through bundling. And we've got examples of that coming in Latin America as well as adding the sports tile, the ESPN tile to our Disney+ offering.\n And obviously, we've already added Hulu. In addition to that, password sharing remains an opportunity. We're just getting started on reducing distribution costs or an opportunity and leveraging technology for direct-to-consumer marketing as well as recommendation engines, which help both on the revenue and cost side. And ultimately, we'll get to building out the international business even more strongly.\n So from the perspective of building the business, it will be a combination of both managing costs more tightly but also growth, which will allow us to leverage the cost structure we have right now. And we feel very, very positively about that. Specific timing, I'm not going to comment on for margins. I don't like to get ahead of the next year until we get to the next year.\n And in addition to that, from a competitive perspective, I'd rather not give my competitors the pathway and exactly how and when we're going to achieve the margin goals we're looking to achieve. But overall, business is in great shape, and we feel good about the growth prospects. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Two questions. Bob, on ESPN, there's obviously a lot of focus on the NBA. You've got a lot going on in terms of new product launches, rights packages coming up. You sound as bullish as ever on sort of pivoting this business. Can you just talk about the next kind of 12 to 18 months and what we think -- what do you think ESPN looks like a couple of years from now?\n And specifically, if you think you can grow this business from an OI point of view, while navigating what is clearly a still inflationary sports rights environment? And then I would love to just get your perspective on sort of the health of the IP at your studios. I know we've talked about this a lot since you've come back into the CEO role. But you -- specifically a lot of Marvel content coming, both on TV and film over the next couple of years. That's an area investors are particularly focused on. How are you feeling about the sort of pipeline on the Marvel side specifically and whether you think this IP is being reinvigorated to the extent you'd like it to be? \nRobert Iger: Thanks, Ben. First on ESPN. I think you have to start in terms of projecting the next 12 to 18 months and also considering where it might go from an OI perspective, as it transitions more to a digital business. You have to look at today and the ratings success of ESPN's phenomenal menu of sports product or the ratings success of live sports in general across the business.\n I mean what you saw with obviously the women's NCAA basketball championships. But across the board, I mentioned in my comments, what the April numbers look like, highest April on record as it for instance, in Primetime at ESPN. So I see sports continuing basically to shine in a world where there's just considerably more choice. Live matters. The other thing that's really important is the engagement that live generates. And I mentioned in my comments, which we haven't really talked about much.\n And I guess a lot of attention has been on the JV that we announced as well as on flagship, which has taken ESPN direct at the end of '25. But at the end of this year, we're going to put an ESPN tile on Disney+ which will have a modest amount of programming, but it's a start in terms of essentially conditioning the audience or subscribers to Disney+ and Hulu, the fact that sports is going to be there. And it also will help us in terms of overall engagement with our bundle.\n As I look ahead, I think ESPN is going to make a pivot toward digital, but without abandoning linear. So it will remain on linear if people want to get ESPN and its different channels through a cable or a satellite subscription, that's fine. And if they want to pivot smoothly because there will be many different access points to get the digital product to ESPN Digital. They can do so as part of a bundle with other sports services. They can do so directly from ESPN with the ESPN app or they can do it as part of a bundle with our own services. So I feel very bullish about it.\n You also have to look at the menu of sports rights that ESPN has bought and Hugh did a good job describing this on the air this morning in one of his interviews. First of all, we've locked up long-term deals with significant sports organizations. That includes college football championships, all the NCAA championships and the NFL. We're confident or optimistic we're going to end up with an NBA deal that will be long term in our best interest and the best interest of our subscribers.\n And then you look at all the studio product, there's really nothing like ESPN in the sports world and their hand is solid for the next decade. So I feel I'm very bullish, smooth transition to digital, multiple touch points for the consumer, quality programming and sports in general live being very, very attractive in terms of its programming.\n IP at the studio. I've talked a lot about this, as you know. We feel great about the slate coming up, including 3 of the big movies that we have with Planet of the Apes this weekend. Followed by Inside Out 2, which is a great film. And then Deadpool, you mentioned Marvel Ben, in -- coming in July. And then the end of the year, we've got -- we have Alien in the end of the summer, and then we've got Moana 2 and Mufasa at the end of the year.\n We've been working hard with the studio to reduce output and focus more on quality. That's particularly true with Marvel. I know you mentioned television shows. Some of what is coming up is a vestige of basically a desire in the past to increase volume. We're slowly going to decrease volume and go to probably about 2 TV series a year instead of what had become 4 and reduce our film output from maybe 4 a year to 2 to the maximum 3.\n And we're working hard on what that path is. We've got a couple of good films in '25. And then we're heading to more Avengers, which we're extremely excited about. So -- and overall, I feel great about the slate. It's something, as you know, that I've committed to spending more and more time on. The team is, I think, one that I have tremendous confidence in. And the IP that we're mining, including all the sequels that we're doing is second to none. So I feel really good about what's coming up. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. \nJessica Reif Cohen: I will also have 2 different topics. First, on I guess, advertising, direct-to-consumer. Can you give us your thoughts going into the upfront, particularly with the integration of the Trade Desk and Google's TV 360? How does that impact advertising? And any comment you can give us on pivot sharing, like when will you implement it in multitude of borrowers or sharers?\n And then last thing on DTC, but ESPN+ lost subs, which was a little surprising. Can you give us some color on what happened there? And then turning to Sports. Bob, you mentioned the confidence of getting the NBA for a long-term contract. But I guess everybody is expecting that you'll pay a lot more, probably get fewer games. Is there any comment that you can give us on your outlook for profitability with the new contract? And will the inclusion of the NBA negotiations open the door to strategic investment? \nRobert Iger: Sure. I'll take that. Thanks for the question, Jessica. I think that was 2 questions, parts A through E if I captured it correctly. In terms of advertising, generally speaking, the advertising market is pretty healthy right now as we head into the upfront. Certainly, live and sports are playing out very well. And in addition to that, we feel good about the offering we have, particularly in terms of the premium offerings that we have, both in sports as well as with the Disney+ offering.\n The challenge, obviously, in the advertising market right now is there's a lot more supply in the market, largely as a result of one of our competitors entering the ad tier. But that said, I think generally speaking, we feel like we're in a better place than we were a year ago, and we have healthy momentum across nearly all the categories. Auto may be one exception and maybe to some degree, electronics as well. But by and large, demand is out there, and it's pretty high.\n So we lap our way out of the supply increase, I think we're going to be in a good spot as we enter next year. Password sharing beginning next month, in very select markets. We're starting to go after people who are sharing passwords improperly. And that will roll out in earnest or across the globe in September. We feel quite bullish about it. Obviously, we're heartened by the results that Netflix has delivered in their password sharing initiative and believe that it will be one of the contributors to growth, as you noted, going forward.\n I think it's also important to note, look, Netflix is, in many respects, the gold standard when it comes to streaming. But what I mean by that is if you look at programming, we stack up really well. We have a great lineup and quality of programming across not just ESPN and Disney+, but also Hulu. What we're building is the technology that Netflix has had in place and has been building for well over a decade to improve the business from a bottom line perspective. And that starts with password sharing, but it's all the things that Hugh mentioned as well.\n So I feel good about this being a necessary and very, very productive next step in terms of rolling out the technology that we need to get to the double-digit margins that he has talked about. Lastly, in terms of the NBA, I'm really not going to comment about profitability or about the cost of the package except to say, as we've said before, we continue to look at the NBA, not only as a premium sports product but is a sports product that has growth ahead of it. Obviously, with great demographics. We feel really good about the potential package that we will end up with in terms of it basically enabling ESPN to continue to shine in the television sports business.\n And I think it would be -- I won't say anything more about it at this point. If and when there's an announcement, we'll give more details. \nHugh Johnston: And then last on your question around the timing on ESPN+ subscriptions. That's normal seasonality. That's one of the challenges when you look at things from 1 quarter to the next, the seasonality tends to get ignored, but the end of college football season, we do typically see a decline. So nothing out of the ordinary there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. \nRobert Fishman: One for Bob and one for Hugh, if I can. Bob, back to sports, just maybe more broadly, as you think about which sports rights to invest in, how important is securing global rights to drive the international growth for ESPN or even Disney+ as part of your analysis to drive returns to combat the sports rights increases?\n And then for Hugh, as a follow-up to the theatrical slate that Bob was speaking about before, can you just help investors think about the Disney studio profit potential and success and maybe even relative to pre-COVID peak levels? \nRobert Iger: I'll start on the sports question. We have selective rights -- international rights for sports of the sports properties that we've licensed largely for the United States. We also have an array of sports rights in Latin America, many of them came with the acquisition of 20th Century Fox. We're being selective about adding international rights right now where possible, where the opportunity exists, we're doing so. But we're not investing heavily at this point in growing international rights, except again, where we can buy them along with the rights that we're licensing for the United States.\n It's an opportunity for us to plant the seeds of more growth for ESPN outside the United States, but we're walking before we run in that regard. \nHugh Johnston: And then, Robert, to answer your question about studio profitability, as I look back, studio profitability has got some cyclicality to it. And we certainly feel very good about the upcoming slate. That business should get back to profitability, and we certainly feel good about it being a healthy, profitable business over time. Beyond that, I don't want to get into quarterly guidance on a subcomponent of one of our segments. So it's just getting a little bit too low into the details. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. \nKannan Venkateshwar: In terms of the theme park business, maybe Hugh or Bob, if you could talk about the growth framework, which anchors your CapEx plan, it's obviously a pretty significant plan over the next decade. And the business has grown over mid-single digits for a very long period of time. How much upside do you see to this trajectory over the investment horizon?\n And then, Bob, from a succession planning perspective, you've obviously been highly engaged with the Board on this. Could you talk about what your goal is in terms of the hand off? What do you hope to achieve in your tenure before the next CEO takes over? \nHugh Johnston: Okay. I'll take the first one. Regarding the investment in the parks, you know the financials of that business well. It's a 25-plus margin business and has been for an extended period of time, has terrifically high guest satisfaction scores, which create layers of advantage, would suggest we should be able to sustain high margins and high returns on investment. With the business with that profile, you invest in it. We know there are lots of opportunities to continue to grow attendance, both domestically and internationally.\n And the cruise business, frankly, is one that has an enormous number of opportunities for us over time. And that is why we're leaning, we're heavily into that business. So we're not investing capital, obviously, to achieve poor returns. We expect to get excellent returns out of the business, in particular in cruises, given the margin profile of the business, and the fact that it's got the highest guest satisfaction scores in the company. This leads just to conclude, this is a business with a lot of runway left in it, and that will deliver great returns to our shareholders. \nRobert Iger: Regarding succession, Kannan, as we've said before, the Board is heavily engaged in the process and has appointed a succession planning committee that is meeting on a regular basis to not just discuss, but also to manage the process, I'm confident that they will choose the right person at the right time. And that to the extent that I can, we'll participate in the smooth transition. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. \nJohn Hodulik: Bob, engagement on Disney+ has been declining a bit based on the Nielsen gauge data, although I guess it's ticked up a bit here recently at Hulu. But ESPN tile definitely makes sense, but can you talk about efforts to boost viewership on the platform, including the revamp of the technology and maybe the UI that you referenced last quarter? When should we expect to see these benefits or that technology rolled out? Anything you can tell us about engagement for users on the new combined Disney+ Hulu platform?\n So that's one, I guess, with multiple parts. And then following up on ESPN+, again, you lost subs again this quarter. What's the plan for that service once the flagship platform is launched next fall? \nHugh Johnston: John, I'm happy to talk about engagement a little bit on the platform. As I mentioned earlier, the things that we believe drive engagement and still represents significant incremental opportunity for us is number one, programming, having terrific programming is obviously the leading factor. And with what we've been introducing recently, whether it's Shogun, whether it's The Bear over the next couple of years on the TV side. And obviously, the terrific movie slate that's right in front of us. \n As we window it into the streaming service, we think that's going to do great things for engagement. In addition to that, things like recommendation engines, obviously, increase engagement because people are getting more of a sense of what it is that they want to watch based on the suggestions that we make. In addition to that, we do see bundling as an opportunity. Sports bundling, which is why we're putting the ESPN Taiwan. In Latin America, we're combining all into the Disney+ app. Again, all this is geared towards driving engagement.\n So overall, you can be confident we've got laser focused on driving engagement because we know it leads to subscriber satisfaction and it leads to lower churn over time. \nAlexia Quadrani: And John, your second question was about our strategy for ESPN+ once we launch flagship? Was that the question? \nJohn Hodulik: Yes, exactly. I mean is that going to remain a separate service sort of alongside the sort of full blown ESPN streaming service once that's launched next year? \nRobert Iger: The plan is if you buy ESPN flagship, then you'll get all the ESPN+ programming in it. If you do not want that, then you can buy ESPN+ on its own. In addition, if you -- our current plan is that with the tile that we're putting on, the combined Disney+ Hulu app, the ESPN tile, you'll be able -- if you're an ESPN+ subscriber, you'll be able to get ESPN+ through that tile. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. \nDavid Karnovsky: Maybe following up on the studio commentary from earlier. As you noted, your upcoming slate is a number of sequels and that's a strategy where you've had a lot of success in the past. But as you look out over the medium term, how do you think about the balance of leaning on established franchises versus investment in new IP? And then separately, when we look at your summer releases, there are several films from 20th Century Fox IP. So I wanted to see what opportunity you think there is to bring more titles from the Fox library to the forefront? \nRobert Iger: We're going to balance sequels with originals, particularly in animation. We had gone through a period where our original films in animation, both Disney and Pixar were dominating. We're now swinging back a bit to lean on sequels. And so we've talked, as you know, about Toy Story and obviously, Inside Out this summer. I just think that right now, given the competition and the overall movie marketplace that actually, there's a lot of value in sequels, obviously, because they're known, and it takes less in terms of marketing.\n In terms of Marvel specifically, it implies there too. We actually have both Thunderbolts as if for instance, is coming up in 2025 as an original. And then, of course, we mentioned Deadpool this summer, which is a sequel. And I talked about Avengers and Captain America is coming out in 2025. It will just be a balance, which we think is right. \n In terms of 20th Century Fox, we continue to look at the library to see what can be mined. I mentioned Alien earlier. We talked about Avatar 3, which is coming, obviously, Planet of the Apes where there might be more opportunity pending the success of the film to do more. I don't think we'll necessarily lean into the library, but we'll continue to look opportunistically at it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris at Guggenheim. \nMichael Morris: Two questions. First, can you expand or give us an update on the charter partnership. You mentioned a couple of times. I know it was the first quarter of that kind of new relationship or at least new structure. So the questions are, how did that subscriber base perform from an engagement perspective? How was churn? Did the quarter reflect the full impact at this point from a financial perspective? And is this a template that you do expect to use more frequently going forward?\n So that's the first topic. And then second, I wanted to ask about licensing content. And what your view is or your updated view of licensing your content off-platform? What the growth opportunity is there and whether you kind of look at the so-called Netflix effect is something you could benefit from by licensing off platform or whether you want to create that effect yourselves on your own platform and keep content in-house? \nHugh Johnston: Yes. I'll take the first question on this. Look, it's very early days, obviously, in terms of the Charter deal. During the quarter, it was only in place for a couple of months. That said, we're happy with it so far. We obviously have gotten added subscribers. And in addition to that, cannibalization has not been very high. And overall, the engagement has been good. So as for it being a template for the future, I don't think I would go to that level. Each of these deals in many ways has to be architected to the specific needs of the partner as well as our needs.\n So I don't think I would think of it as a template for the future, but it's been a successful deal for us and for Charter. So we feel good about it. \nRobert Iger: We are already doing some licensing with Netflix, and we're looking selectively at other possibilities. I don't want to declare that it's a direction will go more aggressively or not, but we certainly are taking a look at it and being expansive in our thinking about it. We had previously thought that exclusivity, meaning our own product and our own platforms had huge value. It does -- definitely does have some value.\n But as you know, we're also watching as some studios of licensed content to third-party streamers, and that then creates more traction, more awareness. In effect, increases not only the value of the content from a financial perspective, but just in terms of traction. So we're looking at it with an open mind. But I don't think you should expect that we'll do a significant amount of it. \nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thanks for the questions, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Iger",
            "content": "Thank you, Alexia, and good morning, everyone. Our strong performance in Q2 demonstrates we are delivering on our strategic priorities while building for the future. Overall, this was another impressive quarter for us with adjusted earnings per share up 30% compared to prior year. And I'm pleased to say this outperformance raises our full year adjusted EPS growth target to 25%.\n Our results were driven in large part by our Experiences segment and our streaming business, which achieved an important milestone with the entertainment portion of the streaming business, achieving profitability in the quarter. This is a testament to the turnaround we set in motion last year and the outstanding leadership of Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman, Alan Bergman and Dana Walden. It is particularly noteworthy when you consider we reported peak losses only 18 months ago.\n We also remain on track to reach profitability in our combined streaming businesses in Q4. We've said all along our path to profitability will not be linear. And while we are anticipating a softer third quarter due in large part to the seasonality of our India sports offerings, we fully expect streaming to be a growth driver for the company in the future and we have prioritized the steps necessary to achieve this.\n In March, we successfully launched Hulu on Disney+, bringing extensive general entertainment content to the platform for bundled subscribers, and we're encouraged by the early results. And by the end of this calendar year, we will be adding an ESPN title to Disney+ giving all U.S. subscribers access to select live games and studio programming within the Disney+ app. We see this as a first step to bring ESPN to Disney+ viewers as we ready the launch of our enhanced stand-alone ESPN streaming service in the fall of 2025.\n The key to our success in streaming and what consistently brings consumers back for more is the array of exceptional content we produce that captivates audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Looking at our film studios. We have a number of highly anticipated theatrical releases arriving over the next few months, including Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, which opens this Friday, as well as Pixar's Inside Out 2, Marvel's Deadpool and Wolverine and 20th Century Studios, Alien: Romulus, which are all slated for this summer.\n Later this year, we're looking forward to Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King. And in 2025, our slate remains just as robust with Captain America: Brave New World, Fantastic Four, Elio, Zootopia 2 and Avatar 3. Our series also continued to resonate with audiences and critics alike. FX's Shogun has proven to be a global hit, with success on both linear and streaming. It's tracking as FX's most watched show ever on our streaming platforms, and it's driving the second largest number of sign-ups to our streaming services since 2022, behind only Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. This is a great example of how we are successfully reaching wider audiences with our combined linear and streaming ecosystem.\n In Q2, series that aired on linear networks accounted for 17 of the top 20 most viewed series on our streaming platforms with almost 3 billion hours of consumption. Our linear channels are deeply embedded in our direct-to-consumer strategy as they continue to deliver high-quality content that reaches demographics not captured on streaming alone, allowing us to broaden our audiences and leverage our unmatched content engine across an expansive base.\n Turning to ESPN. Sports continues to stand out when it comes to convening large audiences with recent big ratings wins across a variety of sports. ESPN had a fantastic April in terms of total day viewership, the highest April since 2012. For Primetime viewership, it was ESPN's highest April on record. The NCAA Women's Final Four in Cleveland was the most viewed on record and the championship between Iowa and South Carolina was ESPN's most viewed college basketball game ever, men's or women's.\n We also saw record-breaking ratings for the WNBA draft. Monday Night Football had its most watched season since 2000, and the NFL postseason also broke viewership records. The divisional playoff game between the Houston Texans and Baltimore Ravens was ESPN's most watched NFL game ever with 32.4 million viewers. Looking at our experiences business, which remained an impressive financial driver in the quarter, we are focused on turbocharging growth with a number of long-term strategic investments.\n That includes our Disneyland Forward initiative the first step in our expansion plans at Disneyland Resort, which received unanimous preliminary approval by the Anaheim City Council last month. This was a significant milestone and the final vote is expected to take place this evening. We're incredibly excited for the many potential new stories our guests could experience at Walt's original theme park including the much anticipated opportunity to bring Avatar to Disneyland.\n When you consider all of our businesses as a whole, from entertainment, to sports, to experiences, it's clear that no one has what Disney has. The turnaround and growth initiatives we set in motion last year have continued to yield positive results, and we are executing against our ambitious strategic priorities with both speed and determination.\n To walk you through more of our results from the quarter, I will now turn things over to Hugh. Great. Steve, happy to weigh in on both of those. First, in terms of attendance, what we're basically communicating is relative to the post-COVID highs, things are tending to normalize. The Parks business did 10% growth in the quarter. And obviously, that's an extremely high revenue number. That said, we still see in the bookings that we look ahead towards indicate healthy growth in the business.\n So we still certainly feel good about the opportunities for continued strong growth. In addition to that, just to comment a bit more on the timing. As I mentioned on the intro, we do have some onetime expenses occurring in Q3. If we were to back out one-timers both for Q3 and Q4, we expect OI for the quarter to be in the mid- to high single-digit range for Q3 and to be double digit for Q4.\n So certainly feel like the Parks business is still doing very, very well. Obviously, we've got the best in the business in terms of product and people still have a strong desire to basically go on vacation and come to see us.\n With regard to DTC margins, a couple of comments on that. First, our goal with this business is to make it a great growth business with healthy margins, right? We want both, not one versus the other. We've got a lot of levers that give us strong reasons to believe that there's good growth in front of us, whether it's the great programming we have, whether it's higher engagement through bundling. And we've got examples of that coming in Latin America as well as adding the sports tile, the ESPN tile to our Disney+ offering.\n And obviously, we've already added Hulu. In addition to that, password sharing remains an opportunity. We're just getting started on reducing distribution costs or an opportunity and leveraging technology for direct-to-consumer marketing as well as recommendation engines, which help both on the revenue and cost side. And ultimately, we'll get to building out the international business even more strongly.\n So from the perspective of building the business, it will be a combination of both managing costs more tightly but also growth, which will allow us to leverage the cost structure we have right now. And we feel very, very positively about that. Specific timing, I'm not going to comment on for margins. I don't like to get ahead of the next year until we get to the next year.\n And in addition to that, from a competitive perspective, I'd rather not give my competitors the pathway and exactly how and when we're going to achieve the margin goals we're looking to achieve. But overall, business is in great shape, and we feel good about the growth prospects. Thanks, Ben. First on ESPN. I think you have to start in terms of projecting the next 12 to 18 months and also considering where it might go from an OI perspective, as it transitions more to a digital business. You have to look at today and the ratings success of ESPN's phenomenal menu of sports product or the ratings success of live sports in general across the business.\n I mean what you saw with obviously the women's NCAA basketball championships. But across the board, I mentioned in my comments, what the April numbers look like, highest April on record as it for instance, in Primetime at ESPN. So I see sports continuing basically to shine in a world where there's just considerably more choice. Live matters. The other thing that's really important is the engagement that live generates. And I mentioned in my comments, which we haven't really talked about much.\n And I guess a lot of attention has been on the JV that we announced as well as on flagship, which has taken ESPN direct at the end of '25. But at the end of this year, we're going to put an ESPN tile on Disney+ which will have a modest amount of programming, but it's a start in terms of essentially conditioning the audience or subscribers to Disney+ and Hulu, the fact that sports is going to be there. And it also will help us in terms of overall engagement with our bundle.\n As I look ahead, I think ESPN is going to make a pivot toward digital, but without abandoning linear. So it will remain on linear if people want to get ESPN and its different channels through a cable or a satellite subscription, that's fine. And if they want to pivot smoothly because there will be many different access points to get the digital product to ESPN Digital. They can do so as part of a bundle with other sports services. They can do so directly from ESPN with the ESPN app or they can do it as part of a bundle with our own services. So I feel very bullish about it.\n You also have to look at the menu of sports rights that ESPN has bought and Hugh did a good job describing this on the air this morning in one of his interviews. First of all, we've locked up long-term deals with significant sports organizations. That includes college football championships, all the NCAA championships and the NFL. We're confident or optimistic we're going to end up with an NBA deal that will be long term in our best interest and the best interest of our subscribers.\n And then you look at all the studio product, there's really nothing like ESPN in the sports world and their hand is solid for the next decade. So I feel I'm very bullish, smooth transition to digital, multiple touch points for the consumer, quality programming and sports in general live being very, very attractive in terms of its programming.\n IP at the studio. I've talked a lot about this, as you know. We feel great about the slate coming up, including 3 of the big movies that we have with Planet of the Apes this weekend. Followed by Inside Out 2, which is a great film. And then Deadpool, you mentioned Marvel Ben, in -- coming in July. And then the end of the year, we've got -- we have Alien in the end of the summer, and then we've got Moana 2 and Mufasa at the end of the year.\n We've been working hard with the studio to reduce output and focus more on quality. That's particularly true with Marvel. I know you mentioned television shows. Some of what is coming up is a vestige of basically a desire in the past to increase volume. We're slowly going to decrease volume and go to probably about 2 TV series a year instead of what had become 4 and reduce our film output from maybe 4 a year to 2 to the maximum 3.\n And we're working hard on what that path is. We've got a couple of good films in '25. And then we're heading to more Avengers, which we're extremely excited about. So -- and overall, I feel great about the slate. It's something, as you know, that I've committed to spending more and more time on. The team is, I think, one that I have tremendous confidence in. And the IP that we're mining, including all the sequels that we're doing is second to none. So I feel really good about what's coming up. Sure. I'll take that. Thanks for the question, Jessica. I think that was 2 questions, parts A through E if I captured it correctly. In terms of advertising, generally speaking, the advertising market is pretty healthy right now as we head into the upfront. Certainly, live and sports are playing out very well. And in addition to that, we feel good about the offering we have, particularly in terms of the premium offerings that we have, both in sports as well as with the Disney+ offering.\n The challenge, obviously, in the advertising market right now is there's a lot more supply in the market, largely as a result of one of our competitors entering the ad tier. But that said, I think generally speaking, we feel like we're in a better place than we were a year ago, and we have healthy momentum across nearly all the categories. Auto may be one exception and maybe to some degree, electronics as well. But by and large, demand is out there, and it's pretty high.\n So we lap our way out of the supply increase, I think we're going to be in a good spot as we enter next year. Password sharing beginning next month, in very select markets. We're starting to go after people who are sharing passwords improperly. And that will roll out in earnest or across the globe in September. We feel quite bullish about it. Obviously, we're heartened by the results that Netflix has delivered in their password sharing initiative and believe that it will be one of the contributors to growth, as you noted, going forward.\n I think it's also important to note, look, Netflix is, in many respects, the gold standard when it comes to streaming. But what I mean by that is if you look at programming, we stack up really well. We have a great lineup and quality of programming across not just ESPN and Disney+, but also Hulu. What we're building is the technology that Netflix has had in place and has been building for well over a decade to improve the business from a bottom line perspective. And that starts with password sharing, but it's all the things that Hugh mentioned as well.\n So I feel good about this being a necessary and very, very productive next step in terms of rolling out the technology that we need to get to the double-digit margins that he has talked about. Lastly, in terms of the NBA, I'm really not going to comment about profitability or about the cost of the package except to say, as we've said before, we continue to look at the NBA, not only as a premium sports product but is a sports product that has growth ahead of it. Obviously, with great demographics. We feel really good about the potential package that we will end up with in terms of it basically enabling ESPN to continue to shine in the television sports business.\n And I think it would be -- I won't say anything more about it at this point. If and when there's an announcement, we'll give more details. I'll start on the sports question. We have selective rights -- international rights for sports of the sports properties that we've licensed largely for the United States. We also have an array of sports rights in Latin America, many of them came with the acquisition of 20th Century Fox. We're being selective about adding international rights right now where possible, where the opportunity exists, we're doing so. But we're not investing heavily at this point in growing international rights, except again, where we can buy them along with the rights that we're licensing for the United States.\n It's an opportunity for us to plant the seeds of more growth for ESPN outside the United States, but we're walking before we run in that regard. Regarding succession, Kannan, as we've said before, the Board is heavily engaged in the process and has appointed a succession planning committee that is meeting on a regular basis to not just discuss, but also to manage the process, I'm confident that they will choose the right person at the right time. And that to the extent that I can, we'll participate in the smooth transition. The plan is if you buy ESPN flagship, then you'll get all the ESPN+ programming in it. If you do not want that, then you can buy ESPN+ on its own. In addition, if you -- our current plan is that with the tile that we're putting on, the combined Disney+ Hulu app, the ESPN tile, you'll be able -- if you're an ESPN+ subscriber, you'll be able to get ESPN+ through that tile. We're going to balance sequels with originals, particularly in animation. We had gone through a period where our original films in animation, both Disney and Pixar were dominating. We're now swinging back a bit to lean on sequels. And so we've talked, as you know, about Toy Story and obviously, Inside Out this summer. I just think that right now, given the competition and the overall movie marketplace that actually, there's a lot of value in sequels, obviously, because they're known, and it takes less in terms of marketing.\n In terms of Marvel specifically, it implies there too. We actually have both Thunderbolts as if for instance, is coming up in 2025 as an original. And then, of course, we mentioned Deadpool this summer, which is a sequel. And I talked about Avengers and Captain America is coming out in 2025. It will just be a balance, which we think is right. \n In terms of 20th Century Fox, we continue to look at the library to see what can be mined. I mentioned Alien earlier. We talked about Avatar 3, which is coming, obviously, Planet of the Apes where there might be more opportunity pending the success of the film to do more. I don't think we'll necessarily lean into the library, but we'll continue to look opportunistically at it. We are already doing some licensing with Netflix, and we're looking selectively at other possibilities. I don't want to declare that it's a direction will go more aggressively or not, but we certainly are taking a look at it and being expansive in our thinking about it. We had previously thought that exclusivity, meaning our own product and our own platforms had huge value. It does -- definitely does have some value.\n But as you know, we're also watching as some studios of licensed content to third-party streamers, and that then creates more traction, more awareness. In effect, increases not only the value of the content from a financial perspective, but just in terms of traction. So we're looking at it with an open mind. But I don't think you should expect that we'll do a significant amount of it."

            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, for the second fiscal quarter were $1.21 and reflect the second quarter in a row of strong double-digit percentage year-over-year earnings growth. We also met or exceeded all of our financial guidance for the quarter. And as Bob mentioned, we are now targeting adjusted EPS growth of 25% for the full year.\n At our Entertainment segment, second quarter operating income increased by over 70% versus prior year, driven by direct-to-consumer. Entertainment DTC revenue increased 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year and generated operating income of $47 million. These results exceeded our guidance primarily due to expense savings. Core Disney+ subscribers increased by $6.3 million in the quarter, reflecting nearly 8 million additions domestically driven by charter entitlements and a slight loss internationally from the impacts of wholesale deal changes and price increases.\n Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by 6% or $0.44 reflecting price increases for the domestic premium tier as well as international ARPU growth, partially offset by lower ad supported ARPU domestically, driven by dilution from charter entitlements. And the recent Charter deal also drove Disney+ ad tier subscriber growth in the quarter. We ended Q2 with 22.5 million ad tier subscribers globally. We are pleased with the progress we're making in streaming, although as we said before, the path to long-term profitability is not a linear one.\n On that note, we are forecasting a loss for entertainment DTC in the third quarter, the vast majority of which is due to Disney+ Hotstar's ICC Cricket rights. We also do not expect to see core subscriber growth at Disney+ in the third quarter, but anticipate sub growth will return in Q4.\n As Bob mentioned, we continue to expect our combined streaming businesses to be profitable in the fourth quarter and expect further improvements in profitability in fiscal 2025. At Entertainment linear networks, a decrease in operating income versus the prior year was primarily driven by lower affiliate and advertising revenue domestically and lower affiliate revenue internationally. And at content sales, licensing and other lower Q2 results versus the prior year reflect the absence of significant theatrical releases in the quarter.\n For Q3, we expect this business to generate modestly positive operating income, an improvement over the prior quarter and prior year. Moving to sports. Second quarter operating income decreased slightly versus the prior year, driven primarily by a decrease at ESPN, offset by improved results at Star India sports. As expected, at ESPN, lower results at the domestic business reflects higher programming and production costs from the timing of an additional college football playoff game in the quarter versus the prior year, which were only partially offset by higher ad revenue.\n Domestic affiliate revenue also decreased in the quarter. ESPN domestic ad sales increased by more than 20% versus the prior year or high single digits when adjusted for the college football playoff timing shift of an additional game as well as a new NFL divisional playoff game in Q2 of this year. Q3 to date, we are seeing healthy demand driven by the NBA playoffs and domestic ESPN cash ad sales are pacing up.\n At Star, higher results in Q2 versus the prior year include the impact of a decrease in programming and production costs attributable to the nonrenewal of BCCI cricket rights. Looking ahead, note that we are currently expecting to incur linear ICC rights expense at Star India in Q3. At Experiences, second quarter revenue grew 10%, operating income grew 12%, and segment margins expanded by 60 basis points versus the prior year. Parks and Experiences OI increased by 13% year-over-year and consumer products OI increased by 7%.\n Strong international Parks growth was driven by Hong Kong Disneyland Resort while Walt Disney World and the Cruise business both contributed to domestic growth. At Disneyland, despite growing attendance and per capita spend, results declined year-over-year due to cost inflation including from higher labor expenses. We continue to expect robust operating income growth that experiences for the full year. However, third quarter OI is expected to come in roughly comparable to the prior year.\n Several noncomparable or timing-related items are expected to adversely impact Q3 results, including timing of media and tech expenses, noncomparable items in the prior year at consumer products and the timing of Easter. Beyond these comparability related headwinds, the third quarter's results will be impacted by 3 additional factors, higher wage expenses, preopening expenses related to the Disney Treasure and Adventure Cruise ships as well as Disney Cruise Line's New Island Lookout Cay and some normalization of post-COVID demand.\n As it relates to demand, while consumers continue to travel in record numbers, and we are still seeing healthy demand, we are seeing some evidence of a global moderation from peak post-COVID travel. While pressures from wages, preopening costs and demand impacts are expected to persist in Q4, we do expect year-over-year experiences operating income growth to rebound significantly in the fourth quarter due to fewer comparability or timing factors.\n On an enterprise level, we continue to make good progress on our cost efficiency initiatives and remain positioned to exceed our $7.5 billion annualized target. We still expect to generate over $8 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year and the shareholder return goals we've previously spoken about are also still very much on track. We repurchased $1 billion of stock in the second quarter. We continue to position the company for long-term growth and profitability and are making tangible progress on generating compounding earnings and free cash flow growth, which will enable us to continue returning capital to shareholders.\n I'll now hand the call back to Alexia for Q&A. And then last on your question around the timing on ESPN+ subscriptions. That's normal seasonality. That's one of the challenges when you look at things from 1 quarter to the next, the seasonality tends to get ignored, but the end of college football season, we do typically see a decline. So nothing out of the ordinary there. And then, Robert, to answer your question about studio profitability, as I look back, studio profitability has got some cyclicality to it. And we certainly feel very good about the upcoming slate. That business should get back to profitability, and we certainly feel good about it being a healthy, profitable business over time. Beyond that, I don't want to get into quarterly guidance on a subcomponent of one of our segments. So it's just getting a little bit too low into the details. Okay. I'll take the first one. Regarding the investment in the parks, you know the financials of that business well. It's a 25-plus margin business and has been for an extended period of time, has terrifically high guest satisfaction scores, which create layers of advantage, would suggest we should be able to sustain high margins and high returns on investment. With the business with that profile, you invest in it. We know there are lots of opportunities to continue to grow attendance, both domestically and internationally.\n And the cruise business, frankly, is one that has an enormous number of opportunities for us over time. And that is why we're leaning, we're heavily into that business. So we're not investing capital, obviously, to achieve poor returns. We expect to get excellent returns out of the business, in particular in cruises, given the margin profile of the business, and the fact that it's got the highest guest satisfaction scores in the company. This leads just to conclude, this is a business with a lot of runway left in it, and that will deliver great returns to our shareholders. John, I'm happy to talk about engagement a little bit on the platform. As I mentioned earlier, the things that we believe drive engagement and still represents significant incremental opportunity for us is number one, programming, having terrific programming is obviously the leading factor. And with what we've been introducing recently, whether it's Shogun, whether it's The Bear over the next couple of years on the TV side. And obviously, the terrific movie slate that's right in front of us. \n As we window it into the streaming service, we think that's going to do great things for engagement. In addition to that, things like recommendation engines, obviously, increase engagement because people are getting more of a sense of what it is that they want to watch based on the suggestions that we make. In addition to that, we do see bundling as an opportunity. Sports bundling, which is why we're putting the ESPN Taiwan. In Latin America, we're combining all into the Disney+ app. Again, all this is geared towards driving engagement.\n So overall, you can be confident we've got laser focused on driving engagement because we know it leads to subscriber satisfaction and it leads to lower churn over time. Yes. I'll take the first question on this. Look, it's very early days, obviously, in terms of the Charter deal. During the quarter, it was only in place for a couple of months. That said, we're happy with it so far. We obviously have gotten added subscribers. And in addition to that, cannibalization has not been very high. And overall, the engagement has been good. So as for it being a template for the future, I don't think I would go to that level. Each of these deals in many ways has to be architected to the specific needs of the partner as well as our needs.\n So I don't think I would think of it as a template for the future, but it's been a successful deal for us and for Charter. So we feel good about it."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani : Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's first quarter 2024 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript as well as the first quarter earnings presentation will all be made available on our website after the call. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Hugh, we'll be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Iger : Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Just one year ago, we outlined an ambitious plan to return to a period of sustained growth and shareholder value creation. And our strong performance this past quarter demonstrates we have turned the corner and entered a new era. As previously noted, we're focused on transitioning ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, building streaming into a profitable growth business, reinvigorating our film studios and turbocharging growth in our parks and experiences.  Before we dive deeper into our results, let me start by making a number of significant announcements that represent important and exciting steps forward. First, we announced yesterday the full suite of ESPN's channels will now be available direct-to-consumer as part of a new joint venture with Fox and Warner Brothers Discovery to create a new streaming sports service launching this fall. This brings together content from all of these companies' combined assets, including all the major professional sports leagues and college sports.  And in the fall of 2025, we'll be offering ESPN as a stand-alone streaming option with innovative digital features, creating a one-stop sports destination unlike anything available in the marketplace today. ESPN is also adding a sports icon to its lineup with Coach Nick Saban joining the network as an on-air commentator later this year. We're excited to share that in November, we will release a feature-length animated sequel to Moana, which joins a very robust lineup of upcoming theatrical releases. We're also thrilled to share that we're entering into an exciting relationship with Epic Games, acquiring a small equity stake and launching a groundbreaking new games and entertainment universe that brings together Disney's beloved brands and franchises with the hugely popular Fortnite. And I'm pleased to share that Disney's board has declared an additional dividend and will be embarking on a $3 billion stock buyback program in fiscal '24. And one more thing. Next month, ESPN+ will become the exclusive streaming home of Taylor Swift's historic concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, Taylor's Version. I'll be sharing more with you about these announcements momentarily, but what's clear is that the important transformation we undertook last year is bearing fruit. And looking at our results this quarter, we can say with confidence our strategy is working. In Q1, segment operating income increased by 27%, and adjusted earnings per share rose 23% compared to prior year.  We've improved our entertainment streaming operating income by a remarkable 86% year-over-year and remain poised to reach profitability in our on streaming business by the end of fiscal '24 and build on our momentum to deliver significant sustained profit margins in the future. Disney's experiences business generated all-time records in revenue, operating income and operating margin. And we are on track to meet or exceed $7.5 billion in cost savings as we continue to look for further efficiency opportunities across the company. Diving deeper into our announcements, let's first talk about ESPN, which continues to deliver meaningfully for the company and will be a key value driver in the future. ESPN's domestic sports business continues to grow and even amid a challenging linear landscape, ESPN increased its overall audience in calendar year 2023, and it continues to break records in ratings. Ultimately, our mission is to make ESPN into the preeminent digital sports brand, reaching as many sports fans as possible and giving them even more ways to access the programming they love in whatever way best suits their needs. One way will be through the new streaming sports service coming this fall that we announced yesterday in conjunction with Fox and Warner Brothers. Discovery. This service will bring together our collective portfolios of sports channels and direct-to-consumer services on a non-exclusive basis, providing consumers with more of the sports they want in a single place. It's important for us to serve the needs of consumers looking for a seamless way to access an aggregated collection of sports-centric content, including capturing fans moving away from the full cable and satellite bundle. And it's an attractive business proposition for ESPN, allowing us to command per unit economics in line with established market rates for our sports content, just like we do with any streaming or linear service where we offer our programming. Another exciting option available to sports fans will come in the fall of 2025, when we make the full suite of ESPN's channels available as a standalone and highly interactive digital destination. Not only will consumers be able to stream their favorite live games and studio programming, they'll also have access to engaging digital integrations like ESPN Bet and Fantasy Sports, e-commerce features and a deep array of sports stats, all of which we know will be incredibly compelling to younger sports fans in particular. It will also have very robust personalization features. ESPN has long prioritized its desire and ability to serve sports fans wherever they are, and these steps will strengthen ESPN's ability to deliver on that promise.  And as you know, we've also engaged in productive conversations with potential content and marketing partners for ESPN. We've made progress towards securing deals, and we expect to have more to share with you in the near future. We're excited to offer a more unified streaming experience, which we expect will deliver strong benefits in terms of higher engagement, lower churn and greater advertising potential. When we launch our stand-alone ESPN service, we will also make it available on Disney+ for bundled subscribers just as we've done for Hulu. We've already seen an incredible response to the beta launch of Hulu on Disney+, which has far exceeded every metric, and we're looking forward to the full launch next month. This is all part of the ambitious streaming strategy we've been building: From our acquisition of 21st Century Fox that expanded our vast content library and strong pool of creative talent, to the launch of Disney+ at home to a century of content, to securing full control of Hulu and expanding our streaming offerings to reach greater audiences, to our significant investments in technology, and now taking significant steps toward ESPN's streaming future. Disney also has a great advertising story to tell with unparalleled scale and very strong advertising technology, and our ad-supported Disney+ offering is off to a great start. We successfully expanded outside the U.S. with launches in EMEA and Canada and grew to over 1,000 global advertisers in the first quarter. That's a tenfold increase from launch. More than anything, the success of our streaming services is a testament to the amazing content we create with six of the top 10 most streamed movies across all streaming platforms in the U.S. in 2023. Our best-in-class storytelling continues to entertain millions of people.  We received 27 Golden Globe nominations and won top prizes for FX's The Bear and Searchlight's Poor Things. At this year's Primetime Emmy Awards, we took home 37 wins, more than any other entertainment company. And we lead the industry with 20 nominations heading into the Oscars, which will air on March 10 on ABC. We're also proud of our recent Disney-branded programming successes. Percy Jackson and the Olympians, which premiered on both Disney+ and Hulu in December, has become a bonafide hit. Books from the series returned to the number one slot on The New York Times Best Seller list following the debut of the Disney+ series, and I'm thrilled to share that we just picked up a second season.  And the hit children's animated series, Bluey, which is exclusive to the Disney Channel and Disney+ in the United States was recently the number one most streamed show across any streaming platform. Looking ahead, we have an exciting slate of originals coming to Disney+, including Agatha from Marvel Studios, Skeleton Crew and The Acolyte from Lucasfilm, Win or Lose from Pixar and much more.  Additionally, later this month, Hulu will launch FX's highly anticipated Saga Shogun in the U.S. In March, all seasons of Grey's Anatomy, our number one streamed title globally, will join our extensive library of titles on Hulu. When the show returns next month for its 20th season, Hulu will be the only place to see the current and all previous seasons of this truly iconic series. And speaking of icons, over the past year, we've all witnessed the creative genius and sheer power of a true cultural phenomenon, Taylor Swift. When her blockbuster concert film debuts on Disney+ on March 15, it will feature the concert in its entirety, including the song Cardigan and four additional acoustic songs which were not in the theatrical or digital purchase release of the film. We know audience are going to absolutely love the chance to relieve the electrifying Taylor Swift: Eras Tour Taylor's Version whenever they want on Disney+. Turning to our film studios. We have an incredibly robust slate of new releases as we continue revitalizing our creativity. Just consider the lineup of titles we will release through the end of 2026. This year, we have Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Inside Out 2, Deadpool 3, Alien: Romulus and Mufasa: The Lion King. As I mentioned at the top of the call, this November, we'll release a feature-length animated sequel to Moana. This was originally developed as a series, but we were impressed with what we saw, and we knew it deserved a theatrical release. The original Moana film from 2016 recently crossed 1 billion hours streamed on Disney+ and was the most streamed movie of 2023 on any platform in the U.S. Along with the live-action version of the original film that's currently in development, Moana remains an incredibly popular franchise, and we can't wait to give you more of Ohana and Maui when Moana 2 comes to theaters this November. Looking to our 2025 theatrical slate, we're excited to bring audiences Captain America: Brave New World, Fantastic 4, Pixar's Elio, Zootopia 2 and Avatar 3. And we're already looking forward to 2026 and beyond with Frozen 3, the first Toy Story movie since 2019, new Star Wars movie that brings The Mandalorian and Grogu to the big screen for the very first time. These films will not only reach global audiences and theaters, but as we consistently demonstrated, they will become important anchors on our global streaming platforms, driving subscriptions and engagement while also continuing to fuel growth in our experiences business.  After all, one of the things that truly sets Disney apart is our unique ability to turn top-quality IP into top-quality experiences, leading to significant growth. That was certainly true this quarter. Every one of our parks was profitable in Q1, giving us an incredibly solid foundation to build upon as we invest significantly to turbocharge growth in this business.  We've had a tremendous response from guests visiting our newly opened World of Frozen at Hong Kong Disneyland as well as our first-ever Zootopia Land at Shanghai Disney Resort. And as I've said before, we also have so many untapped stories just waiting to be brought to life in our parks across the globe as we continue to invest in this extraordinary business. But it's not just our parks where we're creating new opportunities for consumers to engage with the characters and franchises they love. Our new relationship with Epic Games will create a transformational games and entertainment universe that integrates Disney's world-class storytelling into Epic's cultural phenomenon, Fortnite, enabling consumers to play, watch, create and shop for both digital and physical goods.  This marks Disney's biggest entry ever into the world of video games and offers significant opportunities for growth and expansion. The new immersive universe will allow fans to unleash their own creativity and experience the Disney stories in worlds that they love in groundbreaking new ways. Younger audiences in particular are huge consumers of video games. In fact, among millennials, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, a significant amount of time spent on screen-based platforms is playing video games. This new universe from Disney and Epic provides us with a tremendous opportunity to not only meet more consumers where they are, but to allow more audiences to cultivate a bond with Disney's iconic brands and franchises, including Marvel, Star Wars and much more. Looking at the renewed strength of our businesses this quarter from sports to entertainment to experiences, the stage is now set for significant growth and success. In that regard, we see ample opportunity to increase shareholder returns as our earnings and free cash flow continue to grow. Our current position of strength and confidence in our path ahead already led us to pay a dividend to our shareholders last month. And I'm pleased to share that the board declared that our next semi-annual dividend to be paid in July will be 50% higher versus the last dividend paid in January. The board has also authorized the company to begin repurchasing shares for the first time since fiscal 2018, and we plan to start by targeting $3 billion this fiscal year. As we continue to invest in our growth businesses and maintain our strong balance sheet, we also expect to prioritize dividend payments and share repurchases in the coming years.  I'm proud of our company's remarkable achievements, and I'm grateful to a deep bench of seasoned executives who are helping guide Disney into the future. And that includes Hugh Johnston, our new CFO, who has already proven to be an outstanding addition to the team. We feel very fortunate to have Hugh with us. And now to take you through more of our results this quarter, I'll turn things over to Hugh.\nHugh Johnston : Thanks, Bob. I joined Disney a little over two months ago. And the more I learned about this incredible company, the more excited I am about the opportunities ahead of us. I'm looking forward to continuing to partner with Bob and our management team as we execute on our strategy with the goal of delivering significant consistent long-term earnings and free cash flow growth. We are very pleased with this quarter's financial results. Fiscal first quarter diluted earnings per share excluding certain items increased by 23% versus the prior year to $1.22, and segment operating margin increased by 350 basis points, reflecting both strong pricing and operating expense reductions. Both revenue and operating income at direct-to-consumer, domestic ESPN and experiences all increased versus the prior year. And operating income across each of our business segments grew nicely, in part due to the diligent and ongoing cost efficiency work we're driving throughout our businesses as evidenced by the realization of over $500 million in SG&A and other operating expense savings across the enterprise in the first quarter. Moving to our results by segment. At entertainment, first quarter operating income more than doubled driven by significant improvement at direct-to-consumer. Entertainment direct-to-consumer operating income improved by about $850 million versus the prior year and by nearly $300 million versus Q4. And revenue increased sequentially by over 10%, benefiting from higher subscription and advertising revenue.  Operating income in the first quarter was better than the guidance the company gave in the last earnings call primarily due to expense favorability. Hulu subscribers increased by 1.2 million from Q4 to Q1, and Disney+ core subscribers decreased sequentially by 1.3 million, in line with prior guidance, driven by the expected temporary uptick in churn given the recent domestic price increases as well as the end of the global summer promotion. Those impacts were partially offset by strong ad tier net adds due to domestic growth as well as the launch in certain international markets in the first quarter. Domestically, we saw continued net additions to our bundled offerings in Q1, which, as a reminder, has significantly lower churn versus our standalone products.  Disney+ core ARPU increased by $0.14 versus the prior quarter and by $1.07 versus the prior year driven primarily by price increases. We expect Disney+ core ARPU to increase in the second quarter due to the continued benefit of price increases, which should only be partially offset by the impact of adding Charter's Spectrum TV Select subs to the Disney+ ad tier. I'll note that we are being paid on all entitled Charter subs, which will also be a key driver of accelerated Disney+ core sub growth in Q2.  We expect net adds of between 5.5 million and 6 million in the second quarter. Domestic net adds are expected to be in the 7.5 million range driven by Charter entitlements net of cannibalization. And international core subs are expected to decrease modestly, reflecting changes to certain wholesale deals and slightly elevated churn impacts from price increases. While subscriber growth will vary from quarter-to-quarter, we are confident in our prospects for ongoing sub growth over the longer term driven by the continued global strength of our content slate; advancing our paid sharing efforts; technology advances that are intended to improve our content promotion and discovery capabilities, drive up engagement and lower churn; the impact of making Hulu content available on Disney+ for bundled subs; and continued adoption of the bundle domestically, which should both increase engagement and lower churn, a strategy we will repeat in Latin America this summer when we combine Disney+ and Star+; and our continued use of tiering to provide subscribers with more choices. As it relates to the opportunity we see on paid sharing, beginning this summer, Disney+ accounts suspected of improper sharing will be presented with new capabilities to allow their borrowers to start their own subscriptions. Later this calendar year, account holders who want to allow access to individuals from outside their household will be able to add them to their accounts for an additional fee.  While we are still in the early days and don't expect notable benefits from these paid-sharing initiatives until the back half of calendar 2024, we want to reach as large an audience as possible with our outstanding content, and we're looking forward to rolling out this new functionality to improve the overall customer experience and grow our subscriber base. For Q2, we are expecting revenue at entertainment DTC to grow sequentially and anticipate that operating losses will be relatively in line with the first quarter. We still expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024 and have never been more confident about our path to creating a strong and sustainable streaming business with growing subscribers over the long term, and ultimately, double-digit operating margins, a business which we fully expect to be a key earnings growth driver for the company. Moving on to entertainment linear networks. The decrease in the first quarter operating income versus the prior year was due to lower advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by lower programming and production costs. Lower domestic advertising revenue was driven primarily by lower impressions, including from strike related impacts in addition to an adverse comparison to the prior year midterm-related political advertising at our owned stations. Domestic entertainment affiliate revenue decreased by 5% in the first quarter versus the prior year as a five-point benefit from higher rates was more than offset by a 10-point decline from fewer subscribers. Adjusted for the non-carriage of certain networks at Charter as a result of our recent deal, the sub decline impact was closer to 7%.  Lower programming and production costs benefited from strike related impacts, and we also remain focused on driving ongoing cost efficiencies. At content sales, licensing and other results came in lower versus the prior year and below the guidance we provided due to the performance of theatrical titles in the quarter. We do not have any new key theatrical releases in Q2 due to production delays stemming from the strikes and expect content sales, licensing and other operating income to come in roughly breakeven for the quarter. Sports operating income improved versus the prior year due to strength at ESPN, partially offset by lower results at Star India driven by higher rights costs from airing of the ICC Cricket World Cup. At domestic ESPN, year-over-year growth was driven largely by a decrease in programming production costs from the timing of college football playoff games. Domestic affiliate revenue in Q1 was comparable to the prior year as an increase of 6% from higher contractual rates was offset by a commensurate decrease from fewer subscribers.  ESPN domestic ad sales in the quarter were down 2% versus the prior year but up mid-single digits when adjusted for various timing shifts and onetime impacts. The strength we are seeing gives us confidence that leaning into sports will continue to create value for our shareholders. Second quarter to date, we are seeing continued healthy advertising demand in the sports marketplace with domestic ESPN cash ad sales pacing up double digit percentage points versus the prior year. The trend is still solid even when adjusted for the CFP timing shift of an additional game as well as an extra NFL divisional game in Q2 this year. Our experiences business posted strong Q1 results with year-over-year operating income growth of 10% at parks and experiences and 4% at consumer products. Record setting results this quarter were primarily driven by our performance at Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks, continued strength at Disney Cruise Line and the success of Marvel's Spider Man 2 at our games business. And segment margins expanded by over 50 basis points versus the prior year, an achievement delivered despite tough comparisons at Walt Disney World coming off its highly successful 50th anniversary celebration in the prior year and significant cost pressures driven by wage increases. We remain optimistic about the segment's continued top line and profit growth, notwithstanding the tough comps domestically in Q2, and we still expect robust OI growth at experiences for the full year. We plan to invest approximately $60 billion into the business over the next 10 years, of which approximately 70% is earmarked for incremental capacity expanding investments around the globe, which we expect to generate attractive returns. On a total company basis, as Bob mentioned earlier, we are still on pace to meet or exceed our $7.5 billion annualized cost target by the end of fiscal 2024. I'm pleased with how this is tracking so far. Total expenses in Q1 were down 4% versus the prior year, and the efficiencies we've been realizing are a key contributor to that progress. And we are also still on track to generate about $8 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year. Putting all this together, we are confident in the progress we are making and the path it puts us on to become a strong cash generator and earnings compounder starting in fiscal 2024.  To that end, we expect full year fiscal 2024 earnings per share excluding certain items to increase by at least 20% versus 2023 to approximately $4.60. You already heard from Bob about our updated plans for shareholder returns this year. And as he mentioned, we intend to continue investing in our growth businesses while also maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.\nAlexia Quadrani : Thank you. As we transition to a Q&A, we ask that you please try limit yourself to one question in order to help us get as many analysts as possible today. And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne : Thank you. Good afternoon. You guys had a lot of news for us to chew on tonight. I wanted to maybe start, Bob, asking you about sports since you led with that. You guys have a lot going on with ESPN, new channels package, flagship, obviously having conversations. Can you kind of put it all into context for us? And how you're sort of thinking about these different products and whether they address different parts of the market and what your sort of priorities are between the two? And really, what are we -- what is success for Disney shareholders in sport? How do we think about that kind of financially and strategically?  And I was just wondering if you had an update for us on expense growth this year. I think you guys guided to slight growth overall in '24 last quarter. It seems like you're on track with your savings program. So any update to that would be appreciated. Thanks so much. \nBob Iger : Thanks, Ben. Permit me to throw a couple of cliches your way. But as you know, ESPN has always aimed to serve the sportsman effectively no matter where the sports fan is. And so all of the steps that we've been taking and that we announced today and that we will continue to take are aimed at doing just that.  And when you think about today's environment where you've obviously got some challenges in linear TV, a lot more competition, both for people's time and just specifically in sports, and you think about the fact that ESPN finished '23 in really good shape, ratings continue to rise. Sports is still an advertiser's delight.  You have to consider that ESPN has been successful in what their primary goal was. They're reaching sports fans effectively, which is why advertisers and distributors and sports leagues and organizations feel they have to kind of be part of or partnered with ESPN. As we look to the future, we're obviously mindful of, one, the state of the multichannel ecosystem; two, where people are spending their time and their money with media. And you have to basically serve them effectively there.  We've been saying for a long time that taking ESPN in the direct-to-consumer direction was inevitable and that we were looking for partners to do so. This is really not a first step, it's a second step. The first step was launching ESPN+ some years ago, which has actually been quite successful.  The second step is finding these partners to distribute basically the equivalent of a multi-channel, sports-centric tier via app. So one, we're serving sports fans well. Two, we're doing it with partners. Three, we're doing it in a more modern way rather than cable and satellite in this case, it's app-based.  And that's a big step for us because we know that there are a number of people who have never signed up for multi-channel television. This gives them a chance to do so at a price point that will be obviously more attractive than the big fat bundle. Two, there are people who have left that ecosystem because they didn't want all those channels or that cost. And this is a way of basically preserving a relationship or creating one with those that are no longer part of the multi-channel ecosystem. The next step after this, and we announced today that we'll launch it in probably August of '25, is to bring out ESPN flagship. I say on its own, but it will be bundled ultimately with Hulu and Disney+. And that will be a very, very immersive, very obviously sports-centric app, which will have features that this combination with Fox and with Time Warner Discovery will not have, such as integrated betting, integrated fantasy, likely to have some sales arm or merchandise capabilities. Obviously, deep dive into stats and high degree of customization and personalization. Again, another kind of feature that we'll bring out to engage with sports fans. I can't tell you right now how that ultimately will fit into all of this, except it will be a progression. We haven't really talked much about how it will be further -- how it will be bundled except with our own services. But I think success will be, for us, in this basically migration would be to maintain ESPN's position in sports in general and the affinity that its fans have with ESPN and the attractiveness of ESPN to advertisers and sports leagues. That simple.\nHugh Johnston : Right. I'll take the cost side, Ben. You're right, in the past, we've talked about slight growth in operating expenses year-over-year. We obviously have terrific momentum on cost management coming out of the first quarter. And the team is relentlessly looking for further opportunities to drive cost savings, both to reinvest back in the business to continue the growth momentum that we have as well as deliver margin growth to the bottom line.  Net, no change in guidance versus what we said previously. We should do at least as well as the guidance we previously committed to, which was slight growth in operating expenses year-over-year.\nAlexia Quadrani : Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Absolutely. Our next question today comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson : Hi. One for you, Bob, one for you, Hugh. Bob, in answer to Ben's question, we're still kind of wondering, how does Hulu Live fit into the long-term picture here, right? It stopped growing. YouTube is twice the size. When you think about the future of your offerings, how does that fit into what you just announced with direct over-the-top ESPN and then sports bundle? And then for Hugh, you broke some news, too, with a double-digit margin target for streaming. Any help on a timetable that gets us there? Or what factors do you think will drive you from here to double digits in the next couple of years? Thanks.\nBob Iger : As you know, Hulu Live is more reflects the bigger, fatter bundle of television channels of -- like many other services that are out there. It just happens to be integrated or attached to Hulu if you subscribe to it.  So this, in a way, I guess, you'd argue, competes with Hulu Live directly, but it doesn't compete with Hulu because this will be bundled with Hulu. So if you're a Hulu subscriber and you want to get this new sports service, you can buy that as an add-on to Hulu. And as we see it, that's a real positive because if you consider the fact that Disney+ and Hulu will be together once we come out of beta in March already together in beta, and then you add a sports feature with so many sports that this new joint venture will offer, that's very, very compelling in terms of reducing churn for Hulu and increasing engagement.  So we look at this as a huge positive for Hulu. We're realistic about Hulu Live in terms of the impact this could have, but that Hulu Live is certainly a nice, important feature of our Hulu business, but the critical part of that business is Hulu itself.\nHugh Johnston : And Michael, I'll take the question on DTC profitability in double digit. Yeah, I know we -- for the first time, we put out that our objective is to get to double-digit margins. In some ways, it probably shouldn't be a surprise to investors because the goal has always been to build what I would characterize as a good business. What does a good business look like? Number one, it's got growing; and number two, it has attractive margins, which we're defining as double digits. So I know in a sense it's news, but in a sense, it shouldn't be news because we've always wanted to build a good business in that regard. In terms of how we get there, it's really in many ways the way that we've gotten from where we were to the point we're at right now. Number one, we're going to grow subscribers. Number two, you'll see some level of pricing. And both of those things will probably be similar to what you've seen over the last couple of years, maybe a slightly different balance but roughly similar. And then we'll actually get some leverage out of marketing spend, content and technology spend. All of those will grow a little bit less -- at a lesser rate than the rate of revenue growth. In terms of the specifics on how do we get there with sub growth, I think it will be a couple of things. Number one, paid sharing is an opportunity for us. It's one that our competitor has obviously taken advantage of and one that sits in front of us. And we've got some very specific actions that we're taking in the next couple of months, which I discussed earlier, which will benefit us to some degree in the back half of this year and very much next year. Number two, we'll see lower churn with the bundles that we're looking to put out. Number three, international remains a growth opportunity for us. So if you put all of those pieces together, it's kind of doing a lot of what we've been doing with maybe some slightly different tactics to get to a level that, again, we would characterize as a good business. Not going to put a specific time frame on that right now. Some of that is going to be driven by the marketplace. Just know that we feel a sense of urgency in getting there, and that's probably the way we're going to operate the business. We'll feel urgency, but only to get to a good, sustainable business.\nAlexia Quadrani : Thank you. Operator the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich : Thank you. You guys covered so much ground tonight. So I have one question and two follow-ups. You announced -- or Hugh, for the first time, I've heard you say this that in parks, 70% of the $60 billion in CapEx that you outlined over the next 10 years, like -- I'm sorry, that 70% of that will go to incremental capacity, so like over $40 billion in new parks and attractions. Can you give us some color on timing and location? There's been speculation that you may open a fifth gate in Florida. And then just a follow-up to a couple of things you said. One on paid sharing crackdown, which came up twice. Have you sized the number of borrowers? And on the sports JV, how do you plan to attract non-pay TV subs to what sounds like it might be an expensive sports service without a significant decrease in traditional pay TV subs who would actually save money? Like how do you not cannibalize?\nBob Iger : Okay. You asked a lot of questions on a lot of different subjects. I'll take the first one on park's timing and location. We're already hard at work at basically determining where we're going to place our new investments and what they will be. You can pretty much conclude that they'll be all over, meaning every single one of our locations will be the beneficiary of increased investment and thus increased capacity, including on the High Seas, where we're currently building three more ships. And in a business that is obviously, extremely positive to us, we may look expansively, at least in the next decade in that direction. I'm not going to really give you much more of a sense of timing, except that we're hard at work at getting these things basically conceived and built. And we've got a menu of things that will basically start opening in '25, and there'll be a cadence every year of additional -- basically additional investment and increase capacity.  I'll let Hugh take care of the paid sharing. Hugh?\nHugh Johnston : Yeah.\nBob Iger : On the sports service and the pricing, I think the way you have to look at it is the sports service is going to be substantially less expensive to consumers than the big bundle that they'd have to buy to get those same channels on cable and satellite. And again, designed for two things. One, we believe there are a number of sports fans out there that want to watch sports on television but didn't want to sign up to the big cable and satellite bundle. And so we think they will be accretive to us. We also believe that either consumers have left the bundle because it wasn't serving them well or they may leave the bundle, and we want to make sure that we grab them, too. So we view this whole thing as, one, being a good proposition for sports fans because of the cost and certainly being positive for us because of the dynamics in the marketplace right now.\nHugh Johnston : Okay. And Jessica, I'll handle the paid sharing question. We have sized it. I don't want to put a specific number out there right now because these numbers are obviously rough estimates anyway. Suffice to say that the opportunity that we see on a percentage basis probably isn't all that dramatically different from what our competitor has found in terms of their subscriber base. In terms of getting at it, there's a couple of actions that we've taken in order to do that. Number one, we have some -- made some changes to the user language that we have in the U.S., Canada and certain markets so that we'll actually have the opportunity to act on the paid sharing opportunity. Number two, the accounts that we think are doing unpaid sharing right now will get communication this summer, and we'll give them opportunities to allow their borrowers to start new subscriptions. And then later this year, we'll actually also have account holders who want to allow further individuals to access their accounts from outside that they'll be able to access the account, but they'll be able to do so for an additional fee. So we've got a number of tactical actions to take in order to take advantage of what we think is a pretty good sized opportunity in front of us. And it's one of the things that gives us confidence in our subscriber growth numbers.\nAlexia Quadrani : Thank you. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall : Thank you. So Bob, you mentioned a lot of content in your remarks. It seems like the operations are really starting to hum again. But I think the lifeblood of the company is always going to be the studio output. It drives so much culture. I think that's an area you've said that you've been spending a lot of time on. Do you feel like the content is also now turning the corner like you've seen in the operations? And if so, when do you think we might see some of the results of that renewed focus on the studio output? And then, Hugh, I think the inevitable question with the buyback announcement is what you expect you might end up ultimately paying for Hulu. Just wondering if you have any sense on the timing of that outcome or situation. And related to that, I think the exceed $7.5 billion in savings was a bit new. Curious just where you found those extra buckets of cost savings. Thank you.\nBob Iger : Steven, I feel great about where we are with the studio. Let's not lose sight of the fact that in the last year, the studio had some real success, not to suggest that we didn't have some films that were not successful that we were really disappointed in, but we also had some great success too with the Guardian sequel and Avatar at the end of calendar '22 but part of fiscal '23. One of the things that I've been saying before is that volume sometimes can be detrimental to quality. And in our zeal to greatly increase volume, partially tied to wanting to chase more global subs for our streaming platform. Some of our studios lost a little focus, so the first step that we've taken is that we've reduced volume, we've reduced output, particularly in Marvel. When you fix or when you address these issues with -- in movies, you do three things. You get aggressive at making sure the films you're making can be even better. Sometimes you kill projects you don't believe in. And of course, you put new things in the pipeline that you do believe in that you have much more confidence in. And we're doing all of that. I've also observed over the years that managing creativity sometimes is best done with great partnerships. And I have established great partnerships with the people at our company that really manage their creativity, Alan Bergman with the studio, Dana Walden on the television side, Jimmy Pitaro at ESPN. And the partnership that Alan and I have is a strong one, and we believe that the time that I'm now devoting to this and the attention that the two of us are giving this business not only will bear fruit, but it's already starting to.  We're very bullish about the films coming out. We mentioned Insight Out 2, and we talked about Deadpool and the Planet of the Apes film. We feel good about that. Obviously, the end of the calendar year, we've got Mufasa, prequel to Lion King. We are very excited about the addition of Moana, which is the number one streamed movie of -- across all streamers in the U.S. in '23 and is at over 1 billion hours of consumption on Disney+. And that's now going to be released in November.  And then I mentioned what we're doing after that. I'd say we're leaning a little bit more into sequels and franchises, some that we feel great about, like Toy Story is -- for instance, obviously, Star Wars, Avatar, we've talked about. Marvel is starting to focus on some of its stronger franchises going forward, but I'll leave it at that.  And I think given the environment and given what it takes to get people out of their homes to see a film, doing that, leaning on franchises that are familiar is actually a smart thing. So we've got work to do still. We're not resting on our laurels or sitting on our hands. We're working hard at it, but I feel quite good about the trajectory.\nHugh Johnston : Right. And Steve, from my perspective, regarding Hulu timing on that, we've got a pretty clearly defined process. That process is going to take a little bit of time based on the work that needs to go into valuing the business. I would expect before we get to the end of the year that we should have this figured out and closed. Regarding cost savings, it's pretty well spread out across the board. One of the things you tend to find is when a company goes on a cost effort, once you start to build momentum on that, people tend to find additional opportunities. And that's what gives us the confidence around the numbers to at least meet if not exceed them.  So no one specific area. It's content side as well as the SG&A side. I think we just have momentum on managing our expenses more tightly, which is great news, I think, for investors.\nAlexia Quadrani : Thank you. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft : Hi, good afternoon. Since there's so much discussion about bundling and distribution, I was wondering if I could ask you if you could share any observations related to Charter integrating Disney+ into its pay TV programming tiers. Is there anything you could say about the percentage of customers actually using it or engagement levels relative to the average Disney+ subscriber?  And maybe lastly, do you think that this is a model that you'd like to replicate with other pay TV distributors over time as your agreements come up for renewal? Thanks. \nBob Iger : Thanks, Bryan. It's really early. They didn't start introducing this to their subscribers really until January, and they didn't roll it all out right away. And so we're seeing some stats on this that are somewhat encouraging, but I want to be careful that because it's early, we're not sure whether those trends will continue or not. I do think that this kind of arrangement is one that we'll likely see with other multi-channel distributors. It seemed like it was a win-win for both of us. Important to us, obviously, because it gives us access to more of their customers and important to them in terms of bundling this service with their multichannel customers. So I think it's -- again, I think you'll see more in this direction, but too early yet. We may have more to say about this next quarter when we know a lot more.\nBryan Kraft : Thank you. \nAlexia Quadrani : Operator, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next -- our final question today comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris : Thank you. Good afternoon. One follow-up on the sports JV first, and that's how did you comfortable that the availability of the service won't drive accelerated cord-cutting and become an economic drag on your business and the business more broadly? And how do you expect this to impact your renewal discussions with your distribution partners? That's my first. And then my second, Bob, you've seen several iterations of the video game strategy during your tenure. Can you talk a little bit more about why this investment in Epic Games is the right move for you here and what a product might look like and when that may come to market? Thank you. \nBob Iger : Sure. Let me take the second part of the question first. Yes, you're right. We've tried our hand at video games in a number of different directions. And actually, the one that ended up being the most successful for us was the license. And in fact, we've licensed, I think, $9 billion franchises, including the Spider-Man franchise, which is the most successful video game last year. After I came back, I sat down with Josh D\u2019Amaro, who runs our experiences business and his executive who actually manages games, Sean Shoptaw. And one of the things they showed me -- actually, the first thing they showed me were demographic trends. And when I saw Gen Z and Gen Alpha and even millennials and I saw the amount of time they were spending in terms of their total media screen time on video games, it was stunning to me, equal to what they spend on TV and movies. And the conclusion I reached was we have to be there, and we have to be there as soon as we possibly can in a very compelling way.  We knew through our relationship with Fortnite that there was already success when some of our characters and franchises were expressed or showed up in Fortnite. And we knew Tim Sweeney at Epic because we were involved -- he was involved in our Accelerator program, I think in 2017. And so, I met with Tim, and Josh and his team started a discussion about what if we create a gigantic Disney World a la Fortnite that could live next to Fortnite and be completely interconnected with it, a world where people could play games that we create, could create their own games, could watch.  You can imagine the creation of short-form videos or may -- we may even use the platform to actually distribute some of our content, also the people that could interact with one another, and ultimately, some form of shopping as well and other forms of creation. Obviously, there'll be some -- there are the opportunities to buy digital goods, but maybe even at some point, physical goods. And I just think that given the demographic trends and given the success of Fortnite -- and by the way, they're experiencing really a great era of both customer satisfaction and growth as they return to some of their roots. The numbers at Fortnite have been really compelling.  And we just think this is -- just as we take our IP from our movies and our television and have them expressed in our parks, this is a great way to do it in games. And for us, it's a way to have skin in the game with them with the investment of $1.5 billion, strengthen a partnership because we have skin in the game, but also build a world where we're actually not creating too much risk for the company. So as we see it, this is the best of all worlds in many respects from a business venture perspective and certainly great for consumers who love to interact with our characters already in video game format. So I'm actually really thrilled about it. And the second -- or the first part of your first question, accelerating cord-cutting. Understand that we're going to get paid in this new joint venture for our channels at a level that's commensurate with the level that we get paid for those channels in the multi-channel ecosystem. And so if a consumer moves out of that and then into this, then what we get paid for our -- certainly, these channels that are in it is equal to where we get paid there.  We have some other channels that are not part of this new bundle. But frankly, if you look at our company and you look at what we've done with FX on Hulu, with the Disney Channel on Disney+, with National Geographic on Disney+, we're really very well positioned to withstand, basically, the continued challenges that the multi-channel ecosystem will have. And while there might be some de minimis economic impact on us with more cord-cutting for those channels, we're backstopped in all of those channels with the content that exists or that we ultimately put on Hulu and Disney+.  So it's -- for us, it's very low risk and actually, as I talked earlier, potentially quite accretive to us in terms of signing up sports fans that have never signed up for the bundle where they may no longer want it.\nAlexia Quadrani : Okay.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Iger",
            "content": "Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Just one year ago, we outlined an ambitious plan to return to a period of sustained growth and shareholder value creation. And our strong performance this past quarter demonstrates we have turned the corner and entered a new era. As previously noted, we're focused on transitioning ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, building streaming into a profitable growth business, reinvigorating our film studios and turbocharging growth in our parks and experiences.  Before we dive deeper into our results, let me start by making a number of significant announcements that represent important and exciting steps forward. First, we announced yesterday the full suite of ESPN's channels will now be available direct-to-consumer as part of a new joint venture with Fox and Warner Brothers Discovery to create a new streaming sports service launching this fall. This brings together content from all of these companies' combined assets, including all the major professional sports leagues and college sports.  And in the fall of 2025, we'll be offering ESPN as a stand-alone streaming option with innovative digital features, creating a one-stop sports destination unlike anything available in the marketplace today. ESPN is also adding a sports icon to its lineup with Coach Nick Saban joining the network as an on-air commentator later this year. We're excited to share that in November, we will release a feature-length animated sequel to Moana, which joins a very robust lineup of upcoming theatrical releases. We're also thrilled to share that we're entering into an exciting relationship with Epic Games, acquiring a small equity stake and launching a groundbreaking new games and entertainment universe that brings together Disney's beloved brands and franchises with the hugely popular Fortnite. And I'm pleased to share that Disney's board has declared an additional dividend and will be embarking on a $3 billion stock buyback program in fiscal '24. And one more thing. Next month, ESPN+ will become the exclusive streaming home of Taylor Swift's historic concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, Taylor's Version. I'll be sharing more with you about these announcements momentarily, but what's clear is that the important transformation we undertook last year is bearing fruit. And looking at our results this quarter, we can say with confidence our strategy is working. In Q1, segment operating income increased by 27%, and adjusted earnings per share rose 23% compared to prior year.  We've improved our entertainment streaming operating income by a remarkable 86% year-over-year and remain poised to reach profitability in our on streaming business by the end of fiscal '24 and build on our momentum to deliver significant sustained profit margins in the future. Disney's experiences business generated all-time records in revenue, operating income and operating margin. And we are on track to meet or exceed $7.5 billion in cost savings as we continue to look for further efficiency opportunities across the company. Diving deeper into our announcements, let's first talk about ESPN, which continues to deliver meaningfully for the company and will be a key value driver in the future. ESPN's domestic sports business continues to grow and even amid a challenging linear landscape, ESPN increased its overall audience in calendar year 2023, and it continues to break records in ratings. Ultimately, our mission is to make ESPN into the preeminent digital sports brand, reaching as many sports fans as possible and giving them even more ways to access the programming they love in whatever way best suits their needs. One way will be through the new streaming sports service coming this fall that we announced yesterday in conjunction with Fox and Warner Brothers. Discovery. This service will bring together our collective portfolios of sports channels and direct-to-consumer services on a non-exclusive basis, providing consumers with more of the sports they want in a single place. It's important for us to serve the needs of consumers looking for a seamless way to access an aggregated collection of sports-centric content, including capturing fans moving away from the full cable and satellite bundle. And it's an attractive business proposition for ESPN, allowing us to command per unit economics in line with established market rates for our sports content, just like we do with any streaming or linear service where we offer our programming. Another exciting option available to sports fans will come in the fall of 2025, when we make the full suite of ESPN's channels available as a standalone and highly interactive digital destination. Not only will consumers be able to stream their favorite live games and studio programming, they'll also have access to engaging digital integrations like ESPN Bet and Fantasy Sports, e-commerce features and a deep array of sports stats, all of which we know will be incredibly compelling to younger sports fans in particular. It will also have very robust personalization features. ESPN has long prioritized its desire and ability to serve sports fans wherever they are, and these steps will strengthen ESPN's ability to deliver on that promise.  And as you know, we've also engaged in productive conversations with potential content and marketing partners for ESPN. We've made progress towards securing deals, and we expect to have more to share with you in the near future. We're excited to offer a more unified streaming experience, which we expect will deliver strong benefits in terms of higher engagement, lower churn and greater advertising potential. When we launch our stand-alone ESPN service, we will also make it available on Disney+ for bundled subscribers just as we've done for Hulu. We've already seen an incredible response to the beta launch of Hulu on Disney+, which has far exceeded every metric, and we're looking forward to the full launch next month. This is all part of the ambitious streaming strategy we've been building: From our acquisition of 21st Century Fox that expanded our vast content library and strong pool of creative talent, to the launch of Disney+ at home to a century of content, to securing full control of Hulu and expanding our streaming offerings to reach greater audiences, to our significant investments in technology, and now taking significant steps toward ESPN's streaming future. Disney also has a great advertising story to tell with unparalleled scale and very strong advertising technology, and our ad-supported Disney+ offering is off to a great start. We successfully expanded outside the U.S. with launches in EMEA and Canada and grew to over 1,000 global advertisers in the first quarter. That's a tenfold increase from launch. More than anything, the success of our streaming services is a testament to the amazing content we create with six of the top 10 most streamed movies across all streaming platforms in the U.S. in 2023. Our best-in-class storytelling continues to entertain millions of people.  We received 27 Golden Globe nominations and won top prizes for FX's The Bear and Searchlight's Poor Things. At this year's Primetime Emmy Awards, we took home 37 wins, more than any other entertainment company. And we lead the industry with 20 nominations heading into the Oscars, which will air on March 10 on ABC. We're also proud of our recent Disney-branded programming successes. Percy Jackson and the Olympians, which premiered on both Disney+ and Hulu in December, has become a bonafide hit. Books from the series returned to the number one slot on The New York Times Best Seller list following the debut of the Disney+ series, and I'm thrilled to share that we just picked up a second season.  And the hit children's animated series, Bluey, which is exclusive to the Disney Channel and Disney+ in the United States was recently the number one most streamed show across any streaming platform. Looking ahead, we have an exciting slate of originals coming to Disney+, including Agatha from Marvel Studios, Skeleton Crew and The Acolyte from Lucasfilm, Win or Lose from Pixar and much more.  Additionally, later this month, Hulu will launch FX's highly anticipated Saga Shogun in the U.S. In March, all seasons of Grey's Anatomy, our number one streamed title globally, will join our extensive library of titles on Hulu. When the show returns next month for its 20th season, Hulu will be the only place to see the current and all previous seasons of this truly iconic series. And speaking of icons, over the past year, we've all witnessed the creative genius and sheer power of a true cultural phenomenon, Taylor Swift. When her blockbuster concert film debuts on Disney+ on March 15, it will feature the concert in its entirety, including the song Cardigan and four additional acoustic songs which were not in the theatrical or digital purchase release of the film. We know audience are going to absolutely love the chance to relieve the electrifying Taylor Swift: Eras Tour Taylor's Version whenever they want on Disney+. Turning to our film studios. We have an incredibly robust slate of new releases as we continue revitalizing our creativity. Just consider the lineup of titles we will release through the end of 2026. This year, we have Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Inside Out 2, Deadpool 3, Alien: Romulus and Mufasa: The Lion King. As I mentioned at the top of the call, this November, we'll release a feature-length animated sequel to Moana. This was originally developed as a series, but we were impressed with what we saw, and we knew it deserved a theatrical release. The original Moana film from 2016 recently crossed 1 billion hours streamed on Disney+ and was the most streamed movie of 2023 on any platform in the U.S. Along with the live-action version of the original film that's currently in development, Moana remains an incredibly popular franchise, and we can't wait to give you more of Ohana and Maui when Moana 2 comes to theaters this November. Looking to our 2025 theatrical slate, we're excited to bring audiences Captain America: Brave New World, Fantastic 4, Pixar's Elio, Zootopia 2 and Avatar 3. And we're already looking forward to 2026 and beyond with Frozen 3, the first Toy Story movie since 2019, new Star Wars movie that brings The Mandalorian and Grogu to the big screen for the very first time. These films will not only reach global audiences and theaters, but as we consistently demonstrated, they will become important anchors on our global streaming platforms, driving subscriptions and engagement while also continuing to fuel growth in our experiences business.  After all, one of the things that truly sets Disney apart is our unique ability to turn top-quality IP into top-quality experiences, leading to significant growth. That was certainly true this quarter. Every one of our parks was profitable in Q1, giving us an incredibly solid foundation to build upon as we invest significantly to turbocharge growth in this business.  We've had a tremendous response from guests visiting our newly opened World of Frozen at Hong Kong Disneyland as well as our first-ever Zootopia Land at Shanghai Disney Resort. And as I've said before, we also have so many untapped stories just waiting to be brought to life in our parks across the globe as we continue to invest in this extraordinary business. But it's not just our parks where we're creating new opportunities for consumers to engage with the characters and franchises they love. Our new relationship with Epic Games will create a transformational games and entertainment universe that integrates Disney's world-class storytelling into Epic's cultural phenomenon, Fortnite, enabling consumers to play, watch, create and shop for both digital and physical goods.  This marks Disney's biggest entry ever into the world of video games and offers significant opportunities for growth and expansion. The new immersive universe will allow fans to unleash their own creativity and experience the Disney stories in worlds that they love in groundbreaking new ways. Younger audiences in particular are huge consumers of video games. In fact, among millennials, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, a significant amount of time spent on screen-based platforms is playing video games. This new universe from Disney and Epic provides us with a tremendous opportunity to not only meet more consumers where they are, but to allow more audiences to cultivate a bond with Disney's iconic brands and franchises, including Marvel, Star Wars and much more. Looking at the renewed strength of our businesses this quarter from sports to entertainment to experiences, the stage is now set for significant growth and success. In that regard, we see ample opportunity to increase shareholder returns as our earnings and free cash flow continue to grow. Our current position of strength and confidence in our path ahead already led us to pay a dividend to our shareholders last month. And I'm pleased to share that the board declared that our next semi-annual dividend to be paid in July will be 50% higher versus the last dividend paid in January. The board has also authorized the company to begin repurchasing shares for the first time since fiscal 2018, and we plan to start by targeting $3 billion this fiscal year. As we continue to invest in our growth businesses and maintain our strong balance sheet, we also expect to prioritize dividend payments and share repurchases in the coming years.  I'm proud of our company's remarkable achievements, and I'm grateful to a deep bench of seasoned executives who are helping guide Disney into the future. And that includes Hugh Johnston, our new CFO, who has already proven to be an outstanding addition to the team. We feel very fortunate to have Hugh with us. And now to take you through more of our results this quarter, I'll turn things over to Hugh. Thanks, Ben. Permit me to throw a couple of cliches your way. But as you know, ESPN has always aimed to serve the sportsman effectively no matter where the sports fan is. And so all of the steps that we've been taking and that we announced today and that we will continue to take are aimed at doing just that.  And when you think about today's environment where you've obviously got some challenges in linear TV, a lot more competition, both for people's time and just specifically in sports, and you think about the fact that ESPN finished '23 in really good shape, ratings continue to rise. Sports is still an advertiser's delight.  You have to consider that ESPN has been successful in what their primary goal was. They're reaching sports fans effectively, which is why advertisers and distributors and sports leagues and organizations feel they have to kind of be part of or partnered with ESPN. As we look to the future, we're obviously mindful of, one, the state of the multichannel ecosystem; two, where people are spending their time and their money with media. And you have to basically serve them effectively there.  We've been saying for a long time that taking ESPN in the direct-to-consumer direction was inevitable and that we were looking for partners to do so. This is really not a first step, it's a second step. The first step was launching ESPN+ some years ago, which has actually been quite successful.  The second step is finding these partners to distribute basically the equivalent of a multi-channel, sports-centric tier via app. So one, we're serving sports fans well. Two, we're doing it with partners. Three, we're doing it in a more modern way rather than cable and satellite in this case, it's app-based.  And that's a big step for us because we know that there are a number of people who have never signed up for multi-channel television. This gives them a chance to do so at a price point that will be obviously more attractive than the big fat bundle. Two, there are people who have left that ecosystem because they didn't want all those channels or that cost. And this is a way of basically preserving a relationship or creating one with those that are no longer part of the multi-channel ecosystem. The next step after this, and we announced today that we'll launch it in probably August of '25, is to bring out ESPN flagship. I say on its own, but it will be bundled ultimately with Hulu and Disney+. And that will be a very, very immersive, very obviously sports-centric app, which will have features that this combination with Fox and with Time Warner Discovery will not have, such as integrated betting, integrated fantasy, likely to have some sales arm or merchandise capabilities. Obviously, deep dive into stats and high degree of customization and personalization. Again, another kind of feature that we'll bring out to engage with sports fans. I can't tell you right now how that ultimately will fit into all of this, except it will be a progression. We haven't really talked much about how it will be further -- how it will be bundled except with our own services. But I think success will be, for us, in this basically migration would be to maintain ESPN's position in sports in general and the affinity that its fans have with ESPN and the attractiveness of ESPN to advertisers and sports leagues. That simple. As you know, Hulu Live is more reflects the bigger, fatter bundle of television channels of -- like many other services that are out there. It just happens to be integrated or attached to Hulu if you subscribe to it.  So this, in a way, I guess, you'd argue, competes with Hulu Live directly, but it doesn't compete with Hulu because this will be bundled with Hulu. So if you're a Hulu subscriber and you want to get this new sports service, you can buy that as an add-on to Hulu. And as we see it, that's a real positive because if you consider the fact that Disney+ and Hulu will be together once we come out of beta in March already together in beta, and then you add a sports feature with so many sports that this new joint venture will offer, that's very, very compelling in terms of reducing churn for Hulu and increasing engagement.  So we look at this as a huge positive for Hulu. We're realistic about Hulu Live in terms of the impact this could have, but that Hulu Live is certainly a nice, important feature of our Hulu business, but the critical part of that business is Hulu itself. Okay. You asked a lot of questions on a lot of different subjects. I'll take the first one on park's timing and location. We're already hard at work at basically determining where we're going to place our new investments and what they will be. You can pretty much conclude that they'll be all over, meaning every single one of our locations will be the beneficiary of increased investment and thus increased capacity, including on the High Seas, where we're currently building three more ships. And in a business that is obviously, extremely positive to us, we may look expansively, at least in the next decade in that direction. I'm not going to really give you much more of a sense of timing, except that we're hard at work at getting these things basically conceived and built. And we've got a menu of things that will basically start opening in '25, and there'll be a cadence every year of additional -- basically additional investment and increase capacity.  I'll let Hugh take care of the paid sharing. Hugh? On the sports service and the pricing, I think the way you have to look at it is the sports service is going to be substantially less expensive to consumers than the big bundle that they'd have to buy to get those same channels on cable and satellite. And again, designed for two things. One, we believe there are a number of sports fans out there that want to watch sports on television but didn't want to sign up to the big cable and satellite bundle. And so we think they will be accretive to us. We also believe that either consumers have left the bundle because it wasn't serving them well or they may leave the bundle, and we want to make sure that we grab them, too. So we view this whole thing as, one, being a good proposition for sports fans because of the cost and certainly being positive for us because of the dynamics in the marketplace right now. Steven, I feel great about where we are with the studio. Let's not lose sight of the fact that in the last year, the studio had some real success, not to suggest that we didn't have some films that were not successful that we were really disappointed in, but we also had some great success too with the Guardian sequel and Avatar at the end of calendar '22 but part of fiscal '23. One of the things that I've been saying before is that volume sometimes can be detrimental to quality. And in our zeal to greatly increase volume, partially tied to wanting to chase more global subs for our streaming platform. Some of our studios lost a little focus, so the first step that we've taken is that we've reduced volume, we've reduced output, particularly in Marvel. When you fix or when you address these issues with -- in movies, you do three things. You get aggressive at making sure the films you're making can be even better. Sometimes you kill projects you don't believe in. And of course, you put new things in the pipeline that you do believe in that you have much more confidence in. And we're doing all of that. I've also observed over the years that managing creativity sometimes is best done with great partnerships. And I have established great partnerships with the people at our company that really manage their creativity, Alan Bergman with the studio, Dana Walden on the television side, Jimmy Pitaro at ESPN. And the partnership that Alan and I have is a strong one, and we believe that the time that I'm now devoting to this and the attention that the two of us are giving this business not only will bear fruit, but it's already starting to.  We're very bullish about the films coming out. We mentioned Insight Out 2, and we talked about Deadpool and the Planet of the Apes film. We feel good about that. Obviously, the end of the calendar year, we've got Mufasa, prequel to Lion King. We are very excited about the addition of Moana, which is the number one streamed movie of -- across all streamers in the U.S. in '23 and is at over 1 billion hours of consumption on Disney+. And that's now going to be released in November.  And then I mentioned what we're doing after that. I'd say we're leaning a little bit more into sequels and franchises, some that we feel great about, like Toy Story is -- for instance, obviously, Star Wars, Avatar, we've talked about. Marvel is starting to focus on some of its stronger franchises going forward, but I'll leave it at that.  And I think given the environment and given what it takes to get people out of their homes to see a film, doing that, leaning on franchises that are familiar is actually a smart thing. So we've got work to do still. We're not resting on our laurels or sitting on our hands. We're working hard at it, but I feel quite good about the trajectory. Thanks, Bryan. It's really early. They didn't start introducing this to their subscribers really until January, and they didn't roll it all out right away. And so we're seeing some stats on this that are somewhat encouraging, but I want to be careful that because it's early, we're not sure whether those trends will continue or not. I do think that this kind of arrangement is one that we'll likely see with other multi-channel distributors. It seemed like it was a win-win for both of us. Important to us, obviously, because it gives us access to more of their customers and important to them in terms of bundling this service with their multichannel customers. So I think it's -- again, I think you'll see more in this direction, but too early yet. We may have more to say about this next quarter when we know a lot more. Sure. Let me take the second part of the question first. Yes, you're right. We've tried our hand at video games in a number of different directions. And actually, the one that ended up being the most successful for us was the license. And in fact, we've licensed, I think, $9 billion franchises, including the Spider-Man franchise, which is the most successful video game last year. After I came back, I sat down with Josh D'Amaro, who runs our experiences business and his executive who actually manages games, Sean Shoptaw. And one of the things they showed me -- actually, the first thing they showed me were demographic trends. And when I saw Gen Z and Gen Alpha and even millennials and I saw the amount of time they were spending in terms of their total media screen time on video games, it was stunning to me, equal to what they spend on TV and movies. And the conclusion I reached was we have to be there, and we have to be there as soon as we possibly can in a very compelling way.  We knew through our relationship with Fortnite that there was already success when some of our characters and franchises were expressed or showed up in Fortnite. And we knew Tim Sweeney at Epic because we were involved -- he was involved in our Accelerator program, I think in 2017. And so, I met with Tim, and Josh and his team started a discussion about what if we create a gigantic Disney World a la Fortnite that could live next to Fortnite and be completely interconnected with it, a world where people could play games that we create, could create their own games, could watch.  You can imagine the creation of short-form videos or may -- we may even use the platform to actually distribute some of our content, also the people that could interact with one another, and ultimately, some form of shopping as well and other forms of creation. Obviously, there'll be some -- there are the opportunities to buy digital goods, but maybe even at some point, physical goods. And I just think that given the demographic trends and given the success of Fortnite -- and by the way, they're experiencing really a great era of both customer satisfaction and growth as they return to some of their roots. The numbers at Fortnite have been really compelling.  And we just think this is -- just as we take our IP from our movies and our television and have them expressed in our parks, this is a great way to do it in games. And for us, it's a way to have skin in the game with them with the investment of $1.5 billion, strengthen a partnership because we have skin in the game, but also build a world where we're actually not creating too much risk for the company. So as we see it, this is the best of all worlds in many respects from a business venture perspective and certainly great for consumers who love to interact with our characters already in video game format. So I'm actually really thrilled about it. And the second -- or the first part of your first question, accelerating cord-cutting. Understand that we're going to get paid in this new joint venture for our channels at a level that's commensurate with the level that we get paid for those channels in the multi-channel ecosystem. And so if a consumer moves out of that and then into this, then what we get paid for our -- certainly, these channels that are in it is equal to where we get paid there.  We have some other channels that are not part of this new bundle. But frankly, if you look at our company and you look at what we've done with FX on Hulu, with the Disney Channel on Disney+, with National Geographic on Disney+, we're really very well positioned to withstand, basically, the continued challenges that the multi-channel ecosystem will have. And while there might be some de minimis economic impact on us with more cord-cutting for those channels, we're backstopped in all of those channels with the content that exists or that we ultimately put on Hulu and Disney+.  So it's -- for us, it's very low risk and actually, as I talked earlier, potentially quite accretive to us in terms of signing up sports fans that have never signed up for the bundle where they may no longer want it."

            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. I joined Disney a little over two months ago. And the more I learned about this incredible company, the more excited I am about the opportunities ahead of us. I'm looking forward to continuing to partner with Bob and our management team as we execute on our strategy with the goal of delivering significant consistent long-term earnings and free cash flow growth. We are very pleased with this quarter's financial results. Fiscal first quarter diluted earnings per share excluding certain items increased by 23% versus the prior year to $1.22, and segment operating margin increased by 350 basis points, reflecting both strong pricing and operating expense reductions. Both revenue and operating income at direct-to-consumer, domestic ESPN and experiences all increased versus the prior year. And operating income across each of our business segments grew nicely, in part due to the diligent and ongoing cost efficiency work we're driving throughout our businesses as evidenced by the realization of over $500 million in SG&A and other operating expense savings across the enterprise in the first quarter. Moving to our results by segment. At entertainment, first quarter operating income more than doubled driven by significant improvement at direct-to-consumer. Entertainment direct-to-consumer operating income improved by about $850 million versus the prior year and by nearly $300 million versus Q4. And revenue increased sequentially by over 10%, benefiting from higher subscription and advertising revenue.  Operating income in the first quarter was better than the guidance the company gave in the last earnings call primarily due to expense favorability. Hulu subscribers increased by 1.2 million from Q4 to Q1, and Disney+ core subscribers decreased sequentially by 1.3 million, in line with prior guidance, driven by the expected temporary uptick in churn given the recent domestic price increases as well as the end of the global summer promotion. Those impacts were partially offset by strong ad tier net adds due to domestic growth as well as the launch in certain international markets in the first quarter. Domestically, we saw continued net additions to our bundled offerings in Q1, which, as a reminder, has significantly lower churn versus our standalone products.  Disney+ core ARPU increased by $0.14 versus the prior quarter and by $1.07 versus the prior year driven primarily by price increases. We expect Disney+ core ARPU to increase in the second quarter due to the continued benefit of price increases, which should only be partially offset by the impact of adding Charter's Spectrum TV Select subs to the Disney+ ad tier. I'll note that we are being paid on all entitled Charter subs, which will also be a key driver of accelerated Disney+ core sub growth in Q2.  We expect net adds of between 5.5 million and 6 million in the second quarter. Domestic net adds are expected to be in the 7.5 million range driven by Charter entitlements net of cannibalization. And international core subs are expected to decrease modestly, reflecting changes to certain wholesale deals and slightly elevated churn impacts from price increases. While subscriber growth will vary from quarter-to-quarter, we are confident in our prospects for ongoing sub growth over the longer term driven by the continued global strength of our content slate; advancing our paid sharing efforts; technology advances that are intended to improve our content promotion and discovery capabilities, drive up engagement and lower churn; the impact of making Hulu content available on Disney+ for bundled subs; and continued adoption of the bundle domestically, which should both increase engagement and lower churn, a strategy we will repeat in Latin America this summer when we combine Disney+ and Star+; and our continued use of tiering to provide subscribers with more choices. As it relates to the opportunity we see on paid sharing, beginning this summer, Disney+ accounts suspected of improper sharing will be presented with new capabilities to allow their borrowers to start their own subscriptions. Later this calendar year, account holders who want to allow access to individuals from outside their household will be able to add them to their accounts for an additional fee.  While we are still in the early days and don't expect notable benefits from these paid-sharing initiatives until the back half of calendar 2024, we want to reach as large an audience as possible with our outstanding content, and we're looking forward to rolling out this new functionality to improve the overall customer experience and grow our subscriber base. For Q2, we are expecting revenue at entertainment DTC to grow sequentially and anticipate that operating losses will be relatively in line with the first quarter. We still expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024 and have never been more confident about our path to creating a strong and sustainable streaming business with growing subscribers over the long term, and ultimately, double-digit operating margins, a business which we fully expect to be a key earnings growth driver for the company. Moving on to entertainment linear networks. The decrease in the first quarter operating income versus the prior year was due to lower advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by lower programming and production costs. Lower domestic advertising revenue was driven primarily by lower impressions, including from strike related impacts in addition to an adverse comparison to the prior year midterm-related political advertising at our owned stations. Domestic entertainment affiliate revenue decreased by 5% in the first quarter versus the prior year as a five-point benefit from higher rates was more than offset by a 10-point decline from fewer subscribers. Adjusted for the non-carriage of certain networks at Charter as a result of our recent deal, the sub decline impact was closer to 7%.  Lower programming and production costs benefited from strike related impacts, and we also remain focused on driving ongoing cost efficiencies. At content sales, licensing and other results came in lower versus the prior year and below the guidance we provided due to the performance of theatrical titles in the quarter. We do not have any new key theatrical releases in Q2 due to production delays stemming from the strikes and expect content sales, licensing and other operating income to come in roughly breakeven for the quarter. Sports operating income improved versus the prior year due to strength at ESPN, partially offset by lower results at Star India driven by higher rights costs from airing of the ICC Cricket World Cup. At domestic ESPN, year-over-year growth was driven largely by a decrease in programming production costs from the timing of college football playoff games. Domestic affiliate revenue in Q1 was comparable to the prior year as an increase of 6% from higher contractual rates was offset by a commensurate decrease from fewer subscribers.  ESPN domestic ad sales in the quarter were down 2% versus the prior year but up mid-single digits when adjusted for various timing shifts and onetime impacts. The strength we are seeing gives us confidence that leaning into sports will continue to create value for our shareholders. Second quarter to date, we are seeing continued healthy advertising demand in the sports marketplace with domestic ESPN cash ad sales pacing up double digit percentage points versus the prior year. The trend is still solid even when adjusted for the CFP timing shift of an additional game as well as an extra NFL divisional game in Q2 this year. Our experiences business posted strong Q1 results with year-over-year operating income growth of 10% at parks and experiences and 4% at consumer products. Record setting results this quarter were primarily driven by our performance at Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks, continued strength at Disney Cruise Line and the success of Marvel's Spider Man 2 at our games business. And segment margins expanded by over 50 basis points versus the prior year, an achievement delivered despite tough comparisons at Walt Disney World coming off its highly successful 50th anniversary celebration in the prior year and significant cost pressures driven by wage increases. We remain optimistic about the segment's continued top line and profit growth, notwithstanding the tough comps domestically in Q2, and we still expect robust OI growth at experiences for the full year. We plan to invest approximately $60 billion into the business over the next 10 years, of which approximately 70% is earmarked for incremental capacity expanding investments around the globe, which we expect to generate attractive returns. On a total company basis, as Bob mentioned earlier, we are still on pace to meet or exceed our $7.5 billion annualized cost target by the end of fiscal 2024. I'm pleased with how this is tracking so far. Total expenses in Q1 were down 4% versus the prior year, and the efficiencies we've been realizing are a key contributor to that progress. And we are also still on track to generate about $8 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year. Putting all this together, we are confident in the progress we are making and the path it puts us on to become a strong cash generator and earnings compounder starting in fiscal 2024.  To that end, we expect full year fiscal 2024 earnings per share excluding certain items to increase by at least 20% versus 2023 to approximately $4.60. You already heard from Bob about our updated plans for shareholder returns this year. And as he mentioned, we intend to continue investing in our growth businesses while also maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. And with that, we're happy to take your questions. Right. I'll take the cost side, Ben. You're right, in the past, we've talked about slight growth in operating expenses year-over-year. We obviously have terrific momentum on cost management coming out of the first quarter. And the team is relentlessly looking for further opportunities to drive cost savings, both to reinvest back in the business to continue the growth momentum that we have as well as deliver margin growth to the bottom line.  Net, no change in guidance versus what we said previously. We should do at least as well as the guidance we previously committed to, which was slight growth in operating expenses year-over-year. And Michael, I'll take the question on DTC profitability in double digit. Yeah, I know we -- for the first time, we put out that our objective is to get to double-digit margins. In some ways, it probably shouldn't be a surprise to investors because the goal has always been to build what I would characterize as a good business. What does a good business look like? Number one, it's got growing; and number two, it has attractive margins, which we're defining as double digits. So I know in a sense it's news, but in a sense, it shouldn't be news because we've always wanted to build a good business in that regard. In terms of how we get there, it's really in many ways the way that we've gotten from where we were to the point we're at right now. Number one, we're going to grow subscribers. Number two, you'll see some level of pricing. And both of those things will probably be similar to what you've seen over the last couple of years, maybe a slightly different balance but roughly similar. And then we'll actually get some leverage out of marketing spend, content and technology spend. All of those will grow a little bit less -- at a lesser rate than the rate of revenue growth. In terms of the specifics on how do we get there with sub growth, I think it will be a couple of things. Number one, paid sharing is an opportunity for us. It's one that our competitor has obviously taken advantage of and one that sits in front of us. And we've got some very specific actions that we're taking in the next couple of months, which I discussed earlier, which will benefit us to some degree in the back half of this year and very much next year. Number two, we'll see lower churn with the bundles that we're looking to put out. Number three, international remains a growth opportunity for us. So if you put all of those pieces together, it's kind of doing a lot of what we've been doing with maybe some slightly different tactics to get to a level that, again, we would characterize as a good business. Not going to put a specific time frame on that right now. Some of that is going to be driven by the marketplace. Just know that we feel a sense of urgency in getting there, and that's probably the way we're going to operate the business. We'll feel urgency, but only to get to a good, sustainable business. Yeah. Okay. And Jessica, I'll handle the paid sharing question. We have sized it. I don't want to put a specific number out there right now because these numbers are obviously rough estimates anyway. Suffice to say that the opportunity that we see on a percentage basis probably isn't all that dramatically different from what our competitor has found in terms of their subscriber base. In terms of getting at it, there's a couple of actions that we've taken in order to do that. Number one, we have some -- made some changes to the user language that we have in the U.S., Canada and certain markets so that we'll actually have the opportunity to act on the paid sharing opportunity. Number two, the accounts that we think are doing unpaid sharing right now will get communication this summer, and we'll give them opportunities to allow their borrowers to start new subscriptions. And then later this year, we'll actually also have account holders who want to allow further individuals to access their accounts from outside that they'll be able to access the account, but they'll be able to do so for an additional fee. So we've got a number of tactical actions to take in order to take advantage of what we think is a pretty good sized opportunity in front of us. And it's one of the things that gives us confidence in our subscriber growth numbers. Right. And Steve, from my perspective, regarding Hulu timing on that, we've got a pretty clearly defined process. That process is going to take a little bit of time based on the work that needs to go into valuing the business. I would expect before we get to the end of the year that we should have this figured out and closed. Regarding cost savings, it's pretty well spread out across the board. One of the things you tend to find is when a company goes on a cost effort, once you start to build momentum on that, people tend to find additional opportunities. And that's what gives us the confidence around the numbers to at least meet if not exceed them.  So no one specific area. It's content side as well as the SG&A side. I think we just have momentum on managing our expenses more tightly, which is great news, I think, for investors."
