I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. \n Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. \n I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and 2019 fiscal year results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. \n We were pleased with our 2019 results and improving trends in our supermarket business. As a result of our customer obsession and renewed intensity around operational excellence, we delivered our commitments for identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit, cost savings and delivered over $100 million of incremental operating profit through alternative profit streams in 2019. \n For the full year 2019, we delivered on the total shareholder return, or TSR, model that we outlined at our Investor Day and are positioned to deliver on our TSR model of the future, where you're using the power of Kroger's stable and growing supermarket business to create meaningful incremental operating profit through the alternative profit stream businesses, positioning our business for long-term growth that generates consistently attractive total shareholder returns. \n We continue to generate strong and durable free cash flow as reflected by the fact that the company has reduced debt by $1.1 billion over the prior 4 quarters and continues to increase the dividend to create value for shareholders. In total, we returned $951 million to shareholders in 2019. Our confidence that we can deliver even stronger TSR in the future is guided by our strong free cash flow and sustainable net earnings growth. \n By executing against the Restock Kroger framework, we are repositioning our business by widening and deepening our competitive moats. The 4 main areas of Restock Kroger framework, redefine the customer experience, partner to create value, develop talent and live our purpose, continue to be a top strategic priority for us. We're continuing to enhance the customer connection with investments in our competitive moats today, which are product freshness and quality, Our Brands and personalize rewards and our competitive moat of tomorrow, the seamless ecosystem we are building.\n Fresh continues to be an important driver of sales for Kroger. Our fresh departments drive trips, loyalty and gross margin. Again, our produce department's strong identical sales for the quarter demonstrated how our store teams are focused on improving everyday execution in ways that are highly relevant to our customers. Our Fresh for Everyone campaign has been well received and is driving significant improvements in marketing effectiveness. It is also driving more trips to our seamless ecosystem in-store and online.\n Our Brands achieved its best year ever, exceeding $23.1 billion in sales. We introduced 758 new Our Brand items in 2019, which helps drive strong year-over-year sales lift across our portfolio of brands. \n Since its launch in 2013, Simple Truth has become the leading natural and organic brand in the country with annual sales exceeding $2.5 billion in 2019. After identifying plant-based foods as a key food trend well before 2019, we introduced the Simple Truth Plant Based collection in 2019, and that launch is off to a strong start. The Simple Truth brand expanded into plant-based meats with Emerge grinds and patties in January. In only 1 month, these products ranked third in the category for the entire fourth quarter.\n Our Private Selection brand eclipsed $2 billion in sales for the first time. The Kroger brand exceeded $13.7 billion in sales capitalizing on product development around key customer trends like global and regional flavors. \n Kroger continues to invest in digital as we build a seamless ecosystem that combines the best of the physical store experience with the digital customer experience for our customers. This is where customers are increasingly going to meet their needs. We know our customers value the greater convenience this provides, and our data shows it's an -- central component of driving overall loyalty. Digitally engaged customers not only drive growth through our digital modalities, they also help drive brick-and-mortar sales growth and share of wallet as well. Providing our customers with the ability to have anything, anywhere, anytime from Kroger sets us apart from a large segment of our competitors and will drive loyalty as well as our long-term growth and margin expansion. \n Our approach to partnerships is simple, but not simplistic. We think they work best when the 2 of us can do things together that neither of us could have done alone. We're roughly a year away from our first fully functional customer fulfillment center with Ocado in Monroe, Ohio. These facilities will accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience in a much more cost-effective way. We continue to be excited about the partnership. As we've shared previously, we believe Ocado's value as a partner is not just on its current capabilities, but also how quickly the company is able to innovate and serve rapidly changing consumer market. \n We continue to roll out our plan, and you should not assume just large facilities. We're designing a flexible distribution network, combining disaggregated demand and proximity of our stores, medium-sized facilities and large facilities. Our network will flex as demand matures, and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same-day or next-day delivery or pickup and the customer or store replenishment. \n As America's grocer, we continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger and have made significant investments in our associate wages. The investments Kroger is making in human capital is putting more money in our associates' product -- pockets today. Our investments in associate wages has increased Kroger's average hourly rate to $15 an hour in 2019. And with our comprehensive benefits factored in, our average hourly rate is over $20, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. We are working hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure in the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. Our focus is on developing, training and promoting internal talent while, at the same time, hiring seasoned food industry executives to drive our retail supermarket business. \n In addition to investing in American workers and communities, Kroger is also leading the effort to end hunger in the places we call home and eliminate all waste across the company through our award-winning Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. We made this bold commitment rooted in our purpose because we fundamentally believe that customers, associates and investors are increasingly choosing where to shop, work for and invest in companies that are purpose-driven and are actively making the world a better place. \n In these ways, Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders, both today and in the future. Our focus on the strategic drivers is expanding Kroger's competitive moats and will drive total shareholder return in 2020 and beyond. \n And now I will turn it over to Gary for more details in the quarter financials. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As I get started, I'd like to remind you of the key themes we shared during our Investor Day. Our model is built upon a strong and durable base driven by our retail supermarkets, fuel and health and wellness businesses. It begins with the customer and our obsession with increasing customer loyalty. Our intensified focus on execution and continued improvements in the value and experience we deliver for our customers drive increased identical sales without fuel across our store and digital ecosystem. \n To drive sustainable sales growth, we continue to invest in areas of the business that are important to our customers. This includes ongoing investments in talent, price, digital and store experience with an even greater emphasis on our competitive moats: fresh, Our Brands and personalization, plus the moat we are in the process of building, our seamless ecosystem. We also committed to be very deliberate in balancing these investments with disciplined execution of cost savings that simplify our business. \n Our full year 2019 results demonstrated clear progress towards delivering on this model and generating consistently strong and attractive total shareholder returns. Identical sales without fuel grew 2% in 2019. While first quarter results came in below our identical sales guidance range, the balance of the year came in at the top end of our guidance at 2.25%. Adjusted FIFO operating profit of $3 billion came in at the top end of our guidance range and demonstrated the strength of our multi-faceted business model with industry-wide retail pharmacy gross margin headwinds offset by strong fuel results. \n We demonstrated financial discipline by balancing investments in our customers, associates and the development of our seamless ecosystem with significant cost savings. This was evidenced by our improvement in OG&A rate of 29 basis points, more than offsetting our investment in gross margin rate of 23 basis points during 2019. We achieved over $1 billion of cost savings in 2019 on top of the $1 billion savings in 2018. We also have clear line of sight to $1 billion of incremental savings in 2020. These savings are being achieved through improved productivity and automation, elimination of waste, improved sourcing of goods for sale and goods not for resale and administrative efficiencies. \n We also achieved over $100 million of incremental operating profit through alternative profit streams in 2019 and delivered FIFO net operating profit growth within our 3% to 5% target range shared at Investor Day. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.19, the middle of our guidance range. Finally, we generated strong adjusted free cash flow, which we have used to pay down debt and bring our leverage ratio to within our target range and reintroduced share repurchasing in the fourth quarter. \n Now I'd like to provide commentary on Kroger's fourth quarter results. We delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57 per diluted share of 18.8%. LIFO charge for the quarter was $36 million compared to a LIFO credit of $10 million for the same period last year. This increase was driven by higher inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. Our corporate tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.2% compared to 20.8% for the same period last year. This decrease resulted from an increase in tax deductions. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the fourth quarter was $758 million, up 20.7% compared to $628 million in the fourth quarter in 2018. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 2% during the fourth quarter. Several departments outperformed in our supermarket business, including produce, key beverage categories, pharmacy and natural foods. \n The underlying trends in the business was strong. November and December identical sales were consistent with third quarter performance. As expected, January was negatively impacted as we lapped incremental SNAP dollars in the market in January 2019 and we experienced milder weather this year. February bounced back nicely and performed in line with our expectations and slightly ahead of the trend in the third quarter and November and December. As a reminder, we do expect SNAP to positively impact the first quarter of 2020 as we lap a 15 basis point headwind from prior year. We expect identical sales in 2020 to improve over 2019 as we drive increased customer loyalty through fresh, Our Brands, personalization and seamless. \n Digital contributed approximately 75 basis points to identical sales without fuel. Kroger pickup and delivery continue to grow in a faster pace than our overall digital growth. During the 2019 holiday season, we offered a limited time free pickup promotion in select markets. Customers responded positively to the promotion, and we were pleased with our fourth quarter digital sales growth of 22%. \n Gross margin was 22.1% of sales for the fourth quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 6 basis points. This increase resulted from improvements in cost of goods, accelerated alternative to profit streams and cycling of investments in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offset by investments in price and personalization, continued industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and growth in the specialty pharmacy business. Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the fourth quarter compared to last year. This represents the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement. While retail pharmacy gross margin continued to be a headwind in the fourth quarter, retail pharmacy remains an important part of our strategy and continues to generate good returns and strong customer loyalty. \n OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 79 basis points in the quarter. Part of this was due to cycling of investments in OG&A made in the fourth quarter of 2018, plus broad-based improvements in Restock Kroger savings initiatives. We were pleased with our ability to deliver OG&A improvement above the level of gross margin investment as a rate of sales in 2019, and we expect that balance to continue in 2020. \n Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement. Our loyal customers received hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards in 2019 in the form of price discounts at the pump. The average retail price of fuel was $2.58 this quarter versus $2.34 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the fourth quarter was $0.33 compared to $0.34 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger's sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the fourth quarter. \n Alternative profit streams contributed an incremental operating profit of more than $100 million in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance continued to be the primary drivers of growth. Brands continue to invest in Kroger Precision Marketing because we close the loop between media exposure and store and digital sales to make brand advertising more addressable, actionable and accountable. An annual survey by the Path to Purchase Institute gave us strong ratings for effective targeting, measurement, sales growth and ROI. Most recently, we became the first retail media platform to be awarded Platinum Certification by the Trustworthy Accountability Group for meeting guidelines to improve transparency and prevent ad fraud, malware and piracy. We're committed to being the most transparent media organization and making the entire digital media ecosystem a safe and effective investment for CPG brands. \n As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Memphis during the fourth quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas and Houston. Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations in 2020, including contracts with UFCW for store associates in Dallas, Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Fry's associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. \n We continue to generate strong free cash flow and are being very disciplined in how we deploy it to deliver strong and attractive total shareholder returns. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintain our current investment-grade debt rating and return excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend. In 2019, Kroger reduced our net total debt by $1.1 billion, bringing our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA within our target range. We also returned $486 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $400 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2019 under our $1 billion Board authorization. \n At our Investor Day, we committed to continue to apply a rigorous and disciplined approach to capital management, and we are focused on ensuring our capital projects deliver strong returns. Consistent with our approach in 2019, the majority of our investments in 2020 will be allocated to driving profitable sales growth, improving productivity and building out our supply chain and seamless ecosystem. We also committed to effectively manage our portfolio of assets to improve ROIC over time. \n As part of our review process in the fourth quarter, we recognized an impairment charge relating to the planned closing of 35 stores across the footprint in 2020. This is reflected in the $52 million of transformation costs recognized during the fourth quarter. As we have shared with you previously, Kroger made the decision to divest our interest in Lucky's Market in the third quarter of 2019, and we took the appropriate impairment charge based on the information available at that time. Subsequently, the decision was made by Lucky's Markets to file for bankruptcy in January, which led us to fully write off the value of our investment and deconsolidate Lucky's Market from our consolidated financial statements. This resulted in a noncash charge of $174 million in the fourth quarter. \n Kroger maintains liabilities associated with certain property-related guarantees that will result in Kroger making payments to settle these over time. These items have no effect on net earnings per diluted share or adjusted free cash flow guidance for 2020. \n Turning now to guidance for 2020, building on our momentum in 2019, we continue to expect identical sales without fuel of greater than 2.25%. We also continue to expect adjusted FIFO operating profit of $3 billion to $3.1 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to range between $2.30 and $2.40. Looking at the cadence of EPS growth in 2020, we expect the first quarter to be below our annual EPS growth range of 5% to 10% as we cycle real estate gains in the first quarter of 2019. Overall, I'm encouraged with the momentum created in 2019, which provides a solid platform from which to deliver on our commitments in 2020. \n Now I'll turn it back to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we invite your questions, I'd like to say a few words about the coronavirus. From a financial standpoint, it is too early to tell the effect on our business. It is not included in our guidance. And while it is obviously very early for this public health event in the United States, we're not seeing anything so far that would cause us to change our guidance. \n From a business preparedness standpoint, we have established an internal task force that has activated our pandemic preparedness plan with a focus on our customers, associates and supply chain. We generally believe that we have limited supply chain exposure in China as the majority of the products we source is domestic. We certainly feel for those in America and around the world who have been affected. The health and well-being of our associates, our customers and our communities is Kroger's top priority. Always being there for our communities is part of our heritage and especially in times of uncertainty. We believe everyone deserves to have access to affordable fresh food. \n Returning now to our business results, I want to stress that Restock Kroger is the right strategic framework to deliver both on our 2020 guidance and to position Kroger for sustainable growth and total shareholder return. \n Now we look forward to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Global Research. \nRobert Ohmes: A couple of quick ones. First, just on ClickList with the kind of fee waiver and the response to that and maybe some color, what happens after you put the fee back in and also what are your sort of intermediate term thoughts on keeping a fee versus getting rid of it like some of your competitors seem to have. That would be one. \n And then just 2 other quick ones, just the pharmacy expectations for 2020 and the fuel profit assumptions in your guidance for 2020. Maybe just give us some color so we can think about those things in our modeling. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Robbie. As Gary mentioned, when you look at the digital promotional offer on the waived fee, overall, we're happy with what we learned. We did engage with some new customers. I think it's important to remember that this was a test among many, many tests that we continue to do. And overall, what we're focused on is really how to create a seamless experience. \n In terms of going forward, I wouldn't be comfortable sharing our exact plans because, obviously, that will share -- tell our customers -- our competitors, excuse me, what we're planning to do. And the customer behavior was consistent with what we expected. They were happy and the results since then have been consistent with what we expected as well. And overall, I think it's always important to remember what we're really trying to do is build up a seamless experience. And what we find is the better job we do on creating that seamless experience creates a deeper and deeper loyalty strategy. \n In terms of pharmacy expectations and fuel, Gary, I'll let you answer both of those. \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Robbie. So yes, as you think about the model for 2020, I'll maybe refer back a little bit to some of the things that we talked about at Investor Day. We very much look at the overall customer ecosystem across our food and grocery business, retail pharmacy business and also the fuel business as an overall how do we manage those multifaceted parts of the model. And I think if you look at our performance in 2019, as I've said in some of the prepared comments, we feel like it's a really good demonstration of how we're managing that model where, really, the pharmacy headwinds that we saw in 2019 were fully offset by the fuel benefits that we saw. And then the sort of foundational food and grocery business was pretty stable within that environment. \n I would say that as we look towards 2020, we'll be managing the business in a very similar way. When you think about our overall guidance for 2020, we're essentially expecting that ecosystem to be relatively stable overall, and alternative profit will drive us towards the operating profit growth that we've shared for the full year. Within that guidance, we do expect that pharmacy will continue to have some headwinds, nothing to the extent that we saw in 2019. We think the gross margin structural challenges will continue in 2020. But the team has done a great job in continuing to look for opportunities to take out costs where they don't add value for the customer, our associates and looking for ways to improve our cost of goods where we have control over those items. And so we would expect to see less of a headwind, albeit still somewhat of a headwind from pharmacy in 2020. We would also expect fuel, obviously, to start to normalize. And so probably something of a headwind there within the overall model. And really, the way that we cycle those will be through the strength of continuing to improve our ID sales in the core and the $1 billion of cost savings that I talked about overall within the model. So overall, we think about it very much as all those moving parts creating a relatively stable core business from an operating profit point of view in 2020 and alternative profits driving the growth in the year. \nW. McMullen: Yes. Gary's last point on the incremental profit from alternative profit is an important part, I think, to remember as well. And we -- as we shared in our guidance, we expect it to range somewhere between $125 million and $150 million. \nOperator: Next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Goldman: Two for me. First, I wanted to -- I know it's way too early to -- for you guys to sort of quantify the coronavirus impact, but that won't stop me from trying to ask. And I appreciate -- I would appreciate any help you can give. Can you at least directionally talk about whether it's been a benefit so far in the last couple of weeks? I mean Campbell's Soup yesterday talked about how they are experiencing better orders in the last week or so from some of their customers. We've certainly read about stock-outs of water and so forth. At least directionally, do you think it's been somewhat of a help so far? Or is it really just way too early to say for sure? \nW. McMullen: Personally, and I'll let Gary if he disagrees, I just think it's way too early to say for sure. And the key thing is we -- as I mentioned before, is we want to make sure we're there for our communities, our customers and our associates. And the comments that Campbell's and others have said, certainly, we would see an increase in volume in certain categories. And if you think about a lot of the basics and things that people would need to be able to keep and maintain their health and those things, but it's so early in the process in the United States. And the only pattern that we would have any idea on how to look at it would be China because that is the most -- first developed in terms of going through the impacts. And our -- all of our teams, our stores, our supply chain team, our procurement folks are incredibly focused on making sure that we stay in stock on those critical items in partnering with CPGs and our own supply chain to replenish that. \n I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I would completely agree with your comment, Rodney, as I think it's really too early for us to really have a sense of how customers' overall behavior will change and what the impact will be as the situation obviously evolves in the U.S. market. \n I guess just to build on a couple of points, Ken, with the data points that we do see today. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, February was generally in line with what we've expected for the period of the first month, if you like, around new year. So we didn't see anything dramatically different from what we would've expected during that time period. Certainly, the trend has improved over -- slightly over what we saw in Q3 and November and December. So we will have to see that after January was a month that we knew would be a tough one to cycle. And as Rodney mentioned, in the last few days, I think you've seen more in response to the media activity and some of the advice out there in the market of customers starting to spend more on things like water and hand sanitizer, hand soap, paper and then some of the -- maybe the box dinners and soups that you might expect just based on the guidance that's been given to consumers in the market. So there's certainly been heightened activity in that regard. \n But how that plays out and how it impacts the overall shape of the way customers behave and shop, I think it's really that should be. And I think in the last few days that I would say there's anything different than we would have seen versus what we expected. And how that plays out over a longer period of time is really, I think, impossible to tell. \nKenneth Goldman: Totally understand. I appreciate that. Can I ask a very quick follow-up? Depreciation and amortization seem to be a little bit higher than most people were looking for this quarter. Gary, can you help us understand or think about how to model that for 2020? What numbers do you have in your internal models? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Sure. And thank you for the question. Yes, it's -- it is an area, Ken, where we saw some lumpiness during the year. Part of that is to do with the fact that as we've been dynamically changing our capital allocation, the average life of some of the investments that we make in technology look different from some of the traditional investments that we would've made in a traditional store remodel or a new store opening. We're still investing in those areas, but the mix is certainly changing over time. As that normalizes out, we would be looking at a range of 3% to 5% as a sort of an annualized increase in depreciation to kind of give you more of a big picture perspective on how to think about 2020, if that's helpful. \nOperator: The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: I want to go back to the comments, Rodney, you made about Ocado and the flexibility to just -- to not just assume large facilities. If you can just talk more about the flexibility you guys have to, I guess, have different facility sites and just how you guys are thinking about that flexibility going forward. \nW. McMullen: Yes. As we've talked about before, we really do believe it'll end up being a combination of our physical stores, sheds that are small, medium and large-sized. The ones that we've announced so far have been all large sized. But over time, Ocado continues to spend significant money in R&D and continues to push. So we would expect it'll be a combination of store-based model, smaller-type facilities and bigger-type regional facilities, and Ocado will be a critical partner in that overall ecosystem. And by having those combined, it will also allow us to have the best cost of goods coming into the various sheds and using the total assets that we have today. So we feel really good about the pieces of the puzzle that we're putting together. And we really think the -- and it will support the ability to do both same day and next day. And what we find is, in some cases, customers like same day, some things they like next day. But -- and we're excited. We're really looking forward to the facility in Monroe opening and the second facility in Florida will open soon after that. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then just one follow-up question. So you -- I guess, you announced the closing of 35 stores. Is this the right way to think about the cadence going forward? Or just maybe just walk us through, I guess, the rationale for these store closures? \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks for the question. It's -- I think I've talked a little bit about it at the Investor Day and then in the prepared comments. What we're really focused on is taking a step back and making sure as we think about how the overall portfolio of assets are performing, how do we make sure we're really setting ourselves, that we're making the right investments to accelerate and grow the business but also looking where we have opportunities to optimize the portfolio and to drive, obviously, ROIC over a period of time. \n I would say that this is very much a sort of a stand-alone review that we've taken a step back and said -- look at stores where -- and the average -- to give you some context around it, the average store age is about 28 years old. So these are, in many cases, older stores. They're geographically spread across the countries. There aren't sort of particular markets that it's focused on. It's very much more about looking at our portfolio and really making sure that we see where the customer is going, where we invest our dollars to really drive and support our customers and how we continue to evolve the whole ecosystem that Rodney referred to in his opening comments, just making sure that we're really being disciplined in investing where we see the future growth in the business. And so it's one of those things that just as part of as we manage the business and look for ways to continue to improve and optimize, we're looking to be very deliberate in making those decisions. \nOperator: The next question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. \nKelly Bania: Wanted to just talk about just alternative profits and really where trade promotion dollars ended up for the year. And with -- in your conversations with CPG, just curious if you're finding that there is not any cannibalization or plans for cannibalization as this matures? And just updated thoughts there. \nW. McMullen: Yes. I'll talk broadly, and then I'll let Gary get into the specifics. It's one of the reasons that we partner on the media side of the CPGs and one of the things that we have a very open and transparent relationship going both ways. So we don't want to spend money on Media if the CPG isn't getting a return for it. And that was the reason why we thought it was so important to get the Platinum Certification from the Trustworthy Accountability Group, is that we want to make sure that when we invest the CPG money, that we're able to show that they get a return for it. And by making sure that people are getting a return, that's the best protection, to make sure that they're just not moving trade dollars over. And we tell the CPGs it doesn't do us any good if you just move the trade dollars over. What we're trying to do is provide something that you can't get in the marketplace from a media standpoint. \n We're getting great feedback from the CPGs. We have incredibly high retention rate, and many CPGs continue to expand the amount of money they spend with us. \n Gary, I'll let you get a little bit more into some of the details. \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Rodney. And obviously, I would agree with everything you shared there. I think one of the key things that the team is focused on is really working collaboratively across Stuart Aitken's team, that leads the Media group, and then Joe Grieshaber's team, that leads our merchandising capabilities, to make sure that we really are managing all the moving pieces together. And I would say we feel very good around how those relationships are working to make sure that we're capturing the dollars and really helping support our CPG partners to grow their business effectively through the work that we do in the merchandising group and also through the alternative profit streams with the Media business. \n I wouldn't say that we see anything that's causing us to believe that as the way this is being managed, that they are very much discrete buckets that are generally being allocated to particular activities. We feel very positive about the progress that we're making there on how we see -- I would probably characterize it as how we see a shock in cost of goods and how it flows through to the gross margin. I would say it's one of the reasons that we called it out in the quarter earnings release of -- we certainly continue to invest in price and personalization for our customers. But the combination of cost of goods benefits and alternative profit streams fully offset that in terms of the impact on gross margin and part of the reason why we were able to see a solid performance on gross margin during the quarter. \nKelly Bania: Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just since we were on gross margin a little bit, maybe just another question on pharmacy. So it sounds like the headwind there should moderate a little bit from last year as we look into 2020. But what is the -- what is your long-term expectation there? Does this ever go away? Or is this kind of the new norm? \nGary Millerchip: I think certainly, our assumption in the model is that we expect -- continue to see pressure in certain parts of the way the pharmacy business is structured. Our focus is on really making sure that we're continuing to improve our operation in a way that ensures that, in addition to all the great things that our pharmacy business do for us today around driving overall customer loyalty and delivering a great experience in the store for customers, that we continue to evolve the way we think about the business model. \n I mentioned some of the things in one of the earlier comments around how we're taking costs out of the model where that makes sense and doesn't create value for our associates working in that part of the business or for our customers. We've launched a number of new services, like the Kroger's pharmacy program that allows us to be able to deliver more value for the customer, but also to be able to influence more of the dynamics of how the profitability works in the marketplace and to really deliver more value for customers through that program. \n And then I think the third piece that we talked a little bit about, I think, on a previous call is we truly believe that the power of our data and the overall relationship that we have with the customer potentially opens up opportunities to develop new revenue streams in connecting food to how we deliver our health and wellness services in the store, so thinking about the trend towards food as medicine and how can we connect those relationships even more clearly to help our customers live and eat more healthily when they want to do that, but also to connect into the health care system and helping to take out some of the cost and complexity in that model and generate new revenue streams. \nW. McMullen: We are actively testing where food is actually written under a prescription and helping people live healthier. And when you look at all of that together, we continue to have a great scripts count growth as well. And we really think it's our pharmacy teams and their connections with the patients that's creating that deeper relationship. And as Gary mentioned, when you look at the overall ecosystem, half of health care costs can be affected by the way people eat, and we really believe, with our data, we have the right to help people eat better. \nOperator: The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: My question around -- my real question for you is if -- Rodney, if we take a step back and just assess the last year and the evolution of the state of the business, your business, your stock's going from $30 to $20 back to $30. This quarter -- it was in the quarter, right, FIFO EBIT, even if you back out the onetime -- the benefits of onetime laps was up, right, despite a tough fuel lap, but you had some tough quarters in core grocery. I guess have you finally turned the corner here? What level of confidence do you have? I'm just kind of curious as to your big picture thoughts on sort of like the last year how things have evolved and your confidence level on the business and where it is right now. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Ed. If you look at overall, as we mentioned before, if you look at the momentum during the year, we felt really good about the progress and momentum during the year, and that's in terms of identical sales and if you look at the operational execution. I think Mike and the whole team really have done a great job on those areas. We're really taking care of the customer. We continue to aggressively invest in the seamless experience. And if you look at the alternative profit, it continues to come as we expect it would. \n So that's -- when you look at all those things together is what gave us confidence to continue to support the guidance we gave in November on EPS of $2.30 to $2.40. We expect the business to continue to generate good cash, strong free cash flow while, at the same time, continuing to aggressively invest capital in a seamless experience. So when you look at all those things together, as you know, the last 2 or 3 years, we've been working hard on transforming our fundamental business model, and we feel like we've made significant progress on that and continue to invest in the future from a digital experience. So we're excited about where we are. We're even more excited about where we're headed. \nEdward Kelly: Okay. And I just wanted to ask you a question about share repo and expectations for 2020, especially Q1. I mean Q1's a big cash flow quarter. It seems like share repo is back on. Historically, you bought a lot of stock in Q1. Just thoughts on how we should be thinking about that in the coming years for modeling? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. So obviously, I mentioned a little bit around this in the prepared comments. We committed that as we continue to see strong free cash flow generation, which is a core part of our total shareholder return model, we are committed to continuing to buy back stock as part of the model. As you know, we had a $1 billion authorization from the Board. And as long as we continue to deliver on the performance of the business that we expect and generate the strong free cash flow that we've guided to during the year while also maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio within that target range to support our commitment to our investment-grade rating, we would expect to be continuing to buy back stock within the overall authorization that we have. \n I would say that the way that we're approaching it is very much in a structured way. We're not specifically trying to time the market in some way. It's much more based on a grid approach to how we determine and look at the intrinsic value of the stock. And then we'll put a grid in place to make sure that, over time, if there are opportunities to buy back, we will certainly be executing on that plan throughout the year. \nOperator: The next question is from Christopher Mandeville with Jefferies. \nChris  Mandeville: I guess as it relates to some of the expense control measures found within Restock, can you flesh those out a little bit more specifically? How much of this is related to possibly some head count reductions at the store level or even some reductions in store hours for that matter? Reason why I bring it up is because we have been hearing certain regions have seen some layoffs at the assistant store manager level, and there's been some reductions in hours of operations. So maybe you could just kind of talk about that a little bit and then to what extent maybe some of those reductions are being offset by wage increases that you're putting forward to your associates. \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Chris. Yes. So as we mentioned in some of the prepared comments, that the quarter 4 result obviously did include some cycling of increased investment that we made in Q4 2018. And so some of that is certainly expected, and I know we guided to that as part of what we shared in the EPS expectations when we shared what we thought the cadence would look like throughout 2019. \n We're really seeing the improvements across a broad wave of activity across Restock Kroger. I listed out many of them in the prepared comments, whether it's -- some of the biggest areas would be in goods not for resale as example, where we're sourcing products better and we're managing to really make sure that we're finding opportunities to be more efficient in the way that we're buying and joining the dots across all the different pieces of procurement across the organization. \n Certainly, we're leveraging technology and automation to make sure that we're taking work away where it doesn't add value for the customer. A good example of that might be in cleaning, where it's something that can be done more efficiently and allow our associates to really focus on serving the customer and doing work that the customer really values. \n And then of course, we did announce last quarter that we did make some structural changes to really simplify the work in our divisional offices to make sure that we're, again, putting our associates and talent closer to the customer in these key store management roles and, at the same time, reducing duplication in work so they can make decisions more quickly and respond and serve the customer more effectively. \n So I think we feel very good about it. It's a good balance across the way that we're managing the cost base. Certainly, as we look at the performance of our stores, one of the things that -- building on maybe Rodney's comment to the last question that was asked around confidence in the model, we're very excited about as we see our stores continue to execute at a higher level and continuing to deliver improvements in the fresh experience, the friendly experience and our in-stock position and how we're delivering on Kroger pickup. So we're very focused on making sure our stores are in a good place to be able to deliver on the experience that we know our customers are looking for. And some of those are the reasons why we feel confident as we're guiding to higher ID sales in 2020, because of the great work our store associates are doing in delivering for our customers. \nChris  Mandeville: Okay. And then just my follow-up, it's maybe a little bit too early. But in the areas where we've seen some of the natural organics, not named Lucky's shutter and then with Ahold Delhaize pulling Peapod out of the Midwest, have you realized any benefits already? Or maybe you could just talk about how you're planning to be positioned to capitalize on the share being up for grabs? \nW. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Christopher. If you look at natural and organic, it continues to be one of the highest growing areas. And we really think it's something that, over the years, our teams have done a great job on continuing to make sure we have the most recent product things on trend. The example that I talked about in the prepared remarks in Simple Truth and plant-based. So for us, we're incredibly excited about natural organic. It's grown above the company average for several years, and we would expect it to continue to do that. \n Anytime market share becomes available, we're going to fight for making sure that we get our fair share plus some. And we certainly feel good about what we're getting, and we'll continue to focus on taking care of our customers. Because when our associates are able to take care of the customers, it turns out really well. \nOperator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Rodney, you mentioned on the free pickup that you were pleased with some of the customer satisfaction, I think. Can you tell us, was it a reasonable assumption? Or did you assume that your business would accelerate offering that feature? And was that the case? Did your overall business grow because of it? \nW. McMullen: Yes. It did pick up. And as I mentioned, we did get some new customers. Overall, it was kind of what we expected it to be, and we did it so we can continue to learn. And I think the thing that's important is at any point in time, we'll probably have 20 or 30 different types of tests going on. And the key will be identifying those tests, when you put them together, that create something that's not easily that a competitor can duplicate and it really creates something new for the customer. \n One of the things that's always our strength is our incredible strength on fresh product. And our customers tell us that relative to our big traditional competitors, we score very well. And we think things like that and the service that our associates provide is equally as important. \nSimeon Gutman: Yes. And I guess just checking on some websites, it looks like it's still being offered. I think you may have mentioned you're not going to divulge if that's your strategy. And just tied to it, Ocado, broadly. And I guess, it's early but you still haven't opened the first facility yet. But do you think in this world of click and collect and delivery, that this Ocado model, you could be able to offer these services for free as a -- as table stakes and still have pretty good economics on doing those type of fulfillments? \nW. McMullen: Yes. When you look at Ocado and the combination of our physical -- existing physical stores, we think we'll be able to offer the customer an incredible customer experience and convenience based on what they want. The fee part won't be -- isn't the major driver of making the economics of that work or not. And whether we charge a fee or not will really depend on what's the market opportunity. But Ocado is incredibly efficient. \nOperator: And our final question today is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: Rodney, if you think about the $1 billion of cost saves, right, and the core business ex alternative profit being flat, so that -- you think about that $1 billion going to cover normal inflation in OG&A and then investments in the business, would you think that would be a 50-50 split in terms of how that $1 billion get spent? And then do you think there's another $1 billion more or less in 2021? \nW. McMullen: Yes. The -- I'd say -- I'm trying to do the math in my head as you were asking the question. If you look, we would certainly believe there's opportunities in 2021. We really haven't done the in-depth analysis for -- to be able to say what do I think the specific number is. One of the things that I think is interesting on cost saves and process changes, the more we learn how to do it, the more that we find. So we would be very excited about continuing to identify opportunities to simplify our business and take complication out, which every time we do, it saves money. \n In terms of -- we would -- I don't know that we would say 50-50. I guess what we're looking to do is making sure that we deliver the TSR that we outlined in November at our investor meeting. And the cost saves, along with our -- and continued improvement from our seamless customer experience, in terms of that becoming a bigger tailwind, all of that together is what allows us to be confident and make the commitments we did on TSR. \n I don't know, Gary, any specifics that you would want to add? \nGary Millerchip: No. I would agree with your points, Rodney. I think in terms of the cost savings, as you mentioned it, for me, many of the opportunities that we still see out there are around how we can continue to use technology more effectively and really simplify the design of the work to make it easier for our associates to be successful in the role. And that often means, as you know, John, is we're often reinvesting them in other areas of the store experience and the digital experience. So that net-net, it doesn't necessarily translate through to a total saving in cost because what we're often doing is redeploying those savings into new ways to either improve the experience or to meet the customer where they're at. So it is -- back to Rodney's comment on the what's inflation versus what's incremental is a little bit more difficult as the world's get blurrier around what are the minimum expectations of the customer and where things like average wage going in the marketplace. \nJohn Heinbockel: And then just lastly, maybe just talk to how the Walgreen partnership is ramping up on the procurement side. And does that become a much bigger driver of part of that $1 billion later this year and even bigger next year? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, John. It's -- yes, that's a good call. Actually, that would be very true in the way you characterized it. So we've really just then got off the ground with that part of the partnership. As you know, the retail test that we have in market have now been going for some time, and we've been pleased with the progress there. And we continue to develop our thinking around how to connect more detail with the customer and fulfill on that convenient shopping experience. The group purchasing organization part of it is very much in its infancy stage. We've just started to work on where the opportunities are there, and that would certainly be part of the tailwinds into 2020 and beyond in driving more efficiency and cost savings. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, John. As always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed to our associates and how we live our purpose every day. \n To our associates, thank you for everything that you do for our customers, communities and each other every single day, every single hour of every day. You truly make a difference. This difference makes people's lives better, and this was obviously incredibly evident earlier this week when the devastating tornado touched down in Nashville. I'm always amazed and proud to hear stories of our associates pulling together in the aftermath of events like this. One story that was shared with me is some customers that didn't have protection came to our store to seek shelter inside of our dairy case when the tornado hit, and that's just one example. And the thing that's even, to me, more impressive is what our associates do, what you do when your own families are personally impacted and to all the work that you do to ensure our stores are open and serving our communities. As I mentioned earlier on the call in regard to the threat of the coronavirus, always being there for our communities is part of our heritage. This is Kroger at our best, when we come together and uplift our customers, communities and each other. Thank you for what you do for everyone every day, and thank you for joining our call today. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and 2019 fiscal year results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. \n We were pleased with our 2019 results and improving trends in our supermarket business. As a result of our customer obsession and renewed intensity around operational excellence, we delivered our commitments for identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit, cost savings and delivered over $100 million of incremental operating profit through alternative profit streams in 2019. \n For the full year 2019, we delivered on the total shareholder return, or TSR, model that we outlined at our Investor Day and are positioned to deliver on our TSR model of the future, where you're using the power of Kroger's stable and growing supermarket business to create meaningful incremental operating profit through the alternative profit stream businesses, positioning our business for long-term growth that generates consistently attractive total shareholder returns. \n We continue to generate strong and durable free cash flow as reflected by the fact that the company has reduced debt by $1.1 billion over the prior 4 quarters and continues to increase the dividend to create value for shareholders. In total, we returned $951 million to shareholders in 2019. Our confidence that we can deliver even stronger TSR in the future is guided by our strong free cash flow and sustainable net earnings growth. \n By executing against the Restock Kroger framework, we are repositioning our business by widening and deepening our competitive moats. The 4 main areas of Restock Kroger framework, redefine the customer experience, partner to create value, develop talent and live our purpose, continue to be a top strategic priority for us. We're continuing to enhance the customer connection with investments in our competitive moats today, which are product freshness and quality, Our Brands and personalize rewards and our competitive moat of tomorrow, the seamless ecosystem we are building.\n Fresh continues to be an important driver of sales for Kroger. Our fresh departments drive trips, loyalty and gross margin. Again, our produce department's strong identical sales for the quarter demonstrated how our store teams are focused on improving everyday execution in ways that are highly relevant to our customers. Our Fresh for Everyone campaign has been well received and is driving significant improvements in marketing effectiveness. It is also driving more trips to our seamless ecosystem in-store and online.\n Our Brands achieved its best year ever, exceeding $23.1 billion in sales. We introduced 758 new Our Brand items in 2019, which helps drive strong year-over-year sales lift across our portfolio of brands. \n Since its launch in 2013, Simple Truth has become the leading natural and organic brand in the country with annual sales exceeding $2.5 billion in 2019. After identifying plant-based foods as a key food trend well before 2019, we introduced the Simple Truth Plant Based collection in 2019, and that launch is off to a strong start. The Simple Truth brand expanded into plant-based meats with Emerge grinds and patties in January. In only 1 month, these products ranked third in the category for the entire fourth quarter.\n Our Private Selection brand eclipsed $2 billion in sales for the first time. The Kroger brand exceeded $13.7 billion in sales capitalizing on product development around key customer trends like global and regional flavors. \n Kroger continues to invest in digital as we build a seamless ecosystem that combines the best of the physical store experience with the digital customer experience for our customers. This is where customers are increasingly going to meet their needs. We know our customers value the greater convenience this provides, and our data shows it's an -- central component of driving overall loyalty. Digitally engaged customers not only drive growth through our digital modalities, they also help drive brick-and-mortar sales growth and share of wallet as well. Providing our customers with the ability to have anything, anywhere, anytime from Kroger sets us apart from a large segment of our competitors and will drive loyalty as well as our long-term growth and margin expansion. \n Our approach to partnerships is simple, but not simplistic. We think they work best when the 2 of us can do things together that neither of us could have done alone. We're roughly a year away from our first fully functional customer fulfillment center with Ocado in Monroe, Ohio. These facilities will accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience in a much more cost-effective way. We continue to be excited about the partnership. As we've shared previously, we believe Ocado's value as a partner is not just on its current capabilities, but also how quickly the company is able to innovate and serve rapidly changing consumer market. \n We continue to roll out our plan, and you should not assume just large facilities. We're designing a flexible distribution network, combining disaggregated demand and proximity of our stores, medium-sized facilities and large facilities. Our network will flex as demand matures, and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same-day or next-day delivery or pickup and the customer or store replenishment. \n As America's grocer, we continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger and have made significant investments in our associate wages. The investments Kroger is making in human capital is putting more money in our associates' product -- pockets today. Our investments in associate wages has increased Kroger's average hourly rate to $15 an hour in 2019. And with our comprehensive benefits factored in, our average hourly rate is over $20, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. We are working hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure in the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. Our focus is on developing, training and promoting internal talent while, at the same time, hiring seasoned food industry executives to drive our retail supermarket business. \n In addition to investing in American workers and communities, Kroger is also leading the effort to end hunger in the places we call home and eliminate all waste across the company through our award-winning Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. We made this bold commitment rooted in our purpose because we fundamentally believe that customers, associates and investors are increasingly choosing where to shop, work for and invest in companies that are purpose-driven and are actively making the world a better place. \n In these ways, Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders, both today and in the future. Our focus on the strategic drivers is expanding Kroger's competitive moats and will drive total shareholder return in 2020 and beyond. \n And now I will turn it over to Gary for more details in the quarter financials. Gary? Thanks, Gary. Before we invite your questions, I'd like to say a few words about the coronavirus. From a financial standpoint, it is too early to tell the effect on our business. It is not included in our guidance. And while it is obviously very early for this public health event in the United States, we're not seeing anything so far that would cause us to change our guidance. \n From a business preparedness standpoint, we have established an internal task force that has activated our pandemic preparedness plan with a focus on our customers, associates and supply chain. We generally believe that we have limited supply chain exposure in China as the majority of the products we source is domestic. We certainly feel for those in America and around the world who have been affected. The health and well-being of our associates, our customers and our communities is Kroger's top priority. Always being there for our communities is part of our heritage and especially in times of uncertainty. We believe everyone deserves to have access to affordable fresh food. \n Returning now to our business results, I want to stress that Restock Kroger is the right strategic framework to deliver both on our 2020 guidance and to position Kroger for sustainable growth and total shareholder return. \n Now we look forward to your questions. Thanks, Robbie. As Gary mentioned, when you look at the digital promotional offer on the waived fee, overall, we're happy with what we learned. We did engage with some new customers. I think it's important to remember that this was a test among many, many tests that we continue to do. And overall, what we're focused on is really how to create a seamless experience. \n In terms of going forward, I wouldn't be comfortable sharing our exact plans because, obviously, that will share -- tell our customers -- our competitors, excuse me, what we're planning to do. And the customer behavior was consistent with what we expected. They were happy and the results since then have been consistent with what we expected as well. And overall, I think it's always important to remember what we're really trying to do is build up a seamless experience. And what we find is the better job we do on creating that seamless experience creates a deeper and deeper loyalty strategy. \n In terms of pharmacy expectations and fuel, Gary, I'll let you answer both of those. Yes. Gary's last point on the incremental profit from alternative profit is an important part, I think, to remember as well. And we -- as we shared in our guidance, we expect it to range somewhere between $125 million and $150 million. Personally, and I'll let Gary if he disagrees, I just think it's way too early to say for sure. And the key thing is we -- as I mentioned before, is we want to make sure we're there for our communities, our customers and our associates. And the comments that Campbell's and others have said, certainly, we would see an increase in volume in certain categories. And if you think about a lot of the basics and things that people would need to be able to keep and maintain their health and those things, but it's so early in the process in the United States. And the only pattern that we would have any idea on how to look at it would be China because that is the most -- first developed in terms of going through the impacts. And our -- all of our teams, our stores, our supply chain team, our procurement folks are incredibly focused on making sure that we stay in stock on those critical items in partnering with CPGs and our own supply chain to replenish that. \n I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? Yes. As we've talked about before, we really do believe it'll end up being a combination of our physical stores, sheds that are small, medium and large-sized. The ones that we've announced so far have been all large sized. But over time, Ocado continues to spend significant money in R&D and continues to push. So we would expect it'll be a combination of store-based model, smaller-type facilities and bigger-type regional facilities, and Ocado will be a critical partner in that overall ecosystem. And by having those combined, it will also allow us to have the best cost of goods coming into the various sheds and using the total assets that we have today. So we feel really good about the pieces of the puzzle that we're putting together. And we really think the -- and it will support the ability to do both same day and next day. And what we find is, in some cases, customers like same day, some things they like next day. But -- and we're excited. We're really looking forward to the facility in Monroe opening and the second facility in Florida will open soon after that. Yes. I'll talk broadly, and then I'll let Gary get into the specifics. It's one of the reasons that we partner on the media side of the CPGs and one of the things that we have a very open and transparent relationship going both ways. So we don't want to spend money on Media if the CPG isn't getting a return for it. And that was the reason why we thought it was so important to get the Platinum Certification from the Trustworthy Accountability Group, is that we want to make sure that when we invest the CPG money, that we're able to show that they get a return for it. And by making sure that people are getting a return, that's the best protection, to make sure that they're just not moving trade dollars over. And we tell the CPGs it doesn't do us any good if you just move the trade dollars over. What we're trying to do is provide something that you can't get in the marketplace from a media standpoint. \n We're getting great feedback from the CPGs. We have incredibly high retention rate, and many CPGs continue to expand the amount of money they spend with us. \n Gary, I'll let you get a little bit more into some of the details. We are actively testing where food is actually written under a prescription and helping people live healthier. And when you look at all of that together, we continue to have a great scripts count growth as well. And we really think it's our pharmacy teams and their connections with the patients that's creating that deeper relationship. And as Gary mentioned, when you look at the overall ecosystem, half of health care costs can be affected by the way people eat, and we really believe, with our data, we have the right to help people eat better. Thanks, Ed. If you look at overall, as we mentioned before, if you look at the momentum during the year, we felt really good about the progress and momentum during the year, and that's in terms of identical sales and if you look at the operational execution. I think Mike and the whole team really have done a great job on those areas. We're really taking care of the customer. We continue to aggressively invest in the seamless experience. And if you look at the alternative profit, it continues to come as we expect it would. \n So that's -- when you look at all those things together is what gave us confidence to continue to support the guidance we gave in November on EPS of $2.30 to $2.40. We expect the business to continue to generate good cash, strong free cash flow while, at the same time, continuing to aggressively invest capital in a seamless experience. So when you look at all those things together, as you know, the last 2 or 3 years, we've been working hard on transforming our fundamental business model, and we feel like we've made significant progress on that and continue to invest in the future from a digital experience. So we're excited about where we are. We're even more excited about where we're headed. Yes. Thanks, Christopher. If you look at natural and organic, it continues to be one of the highest growing areas. And we really think it's something that, over the years, our teams have done a great job on continuing to make sure we have the most recent product things on trend. The example that I talked about in the prepared remarks in Simple Truth and plant-based. So for us, we're incredibly excited about natural organic. It's grown above the company average for several years, and we would expect it to continue to do that. \n Anytime market share becomes available, we're going to fight for making sure that we get our fair share plus some. And we certainly feel good about what we're getting, and we'll continue to focus on taking care of our customers. Because when our associates are able to take care of the customers, it turns out really well. Yes. It did pick up. And as I mentioned, we did get some new customers. Overall, it was kind of what we expected it to be, and we did it so we can continue to learn. And I think the thing that's important is at any point in time, we'll probably have 20 or 30 different types of tests going on. And the key will be identifying those tests, when you put them together, that create something that's not easily that a competitor can duplicate and it really creates something new for the customer. \n One of the things that's always our strength is our incredible strength on fresh product. And our customers tell us that relative to our big traditional competitors, we score very well. And we think things like that and the service that our associates provide is equally as important. Yes. When you look at Ocado and the combination of our physical -- existing physical stores, we think we'll be able to offer the customer an incredible customer experience and convenience based on what they want. The fee part won't be -- isn't the major driver of making the economics of that work or not. And whether we charge a fee or not will really depend on what's the market opportunity. But Ocado is incredibly efficient. Yes. The -- I'd say -- I'm trying to do the math in my head as you were asking the question. If you look, we would certainly believe there's opportunities in 2021. We really haven't done the in-depth analysis for -- to be able to say what do I think the specific number is. One of the things that I think is interesting on cost saves and process changes, the more we learn how to do it, the more that we find. So we would be very excited about continuing to identify opportunities to simplify our business and take complication out, which every time we do, it saves money. \n In terms of -- we would -- I don't know that we would say 50-50. I guess what we're looking to do is making sure that we deliver the TSR that we outlined in November at our investor meeting. And the cost saves, along with our -- and continued improvement from our seamless customer experience, in terms of that becoming a bigger tailwind, all of that together is what allows us to be confident and make the commitments we did on TSR. \n I don't know, Gary, any specifics that you would want to add? Thanks, John. As always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed to our associates and how we live our purpose every day. \n To our associates, thank you for everything that you do for our customers, communities and each other every single day, every single hour of every day. You truly make a difference. This difference makes people's lives better, and this was obviously incredibly evident earlier this week when the devastating tornado touched down in Nashville. I'm always amazed and proud to hear stories of our associates pulling together in the aftermath of events like this. One story that was shared with me is some customers that didn't have protection came to our store to seek shelter inside of our dairy case when the tornado hit, and that's just one example. And the thing that's even, to me, more impressive is what our associates do, what you do when your own families are personally impacted and to all the work that you do to ensure our stores are open and serving our communities. As I mentioned earlier on the call in regard to the threat of the coronavirus, always being there for our communities is part of our heritage. This is Kroger at our best, when we come together and uplift our customers, communities and each other. Thank you for what you do for everyone every day, and thank you for joining our call today."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As I get started, I'd like to remind you of the key themes we shared during our Investor Day. Our model is built upon a strong and durable base driven by our retail supermarkets, fuel and health and wellness businesses. It begins with the customer and our obsession with increasing customer loyalty. Our intensified focus on execution and continued improvements in the value and experience we deliver for our customers drive increased identical sales without fuel across our store and digital ecosystem. \n To drive sustainable sales growth, we continue to invest in areas of the business that are important to our customers. This includes ongoing investments in talent, price, digital and store experience with an even greater emphasis on our competitive moats: fresh, Our Brands and personalization, plus the moat we are in the process of building, our seamless ecosystem. We also committed to be very deliberate in balancing these investments with disciplined execution of cost savings that simplify our business. \n Our full year 2019 results demonstrated clear progress towards delivering on this model and generating consistently strong and attractive total shareholder returns. Identical sales without fuel grew 2% in 2019. While first quarter results came in below our identical sales guidance range, the balance of the year came in at the top end of our guidance at 2.25%. Adjusted FIFO operating profit of $3 billion came in at the top end of our guidance range and demonstrated the strength of our multi-faceted business model with industry-wide retail pharmacy gross margin headwinds offset by strong fuel results. \n We demonstrated financial discipline by balancing investments in our customers, associates and the development of our seamless ecosystem with significant cost savings. This was evidenced by our improvement in OG&A rate of 29 basis points, more than offsetting our investment in gross margin rate of 23 basis points during 2019. We achieved over $1 billion of cost savings in 2019 on top of the $1 billion savings in 2018. We also have clear line of sight to $1 billion of incremental savings in 2020. These savings are being achieved through improved productivity and automation, elimination of waste, improved sourcing of goods for sale and goods not for resale and administrative efficiencies. \n We also achieved over $100 million of incremental operating profit through alternative profit streams in 2019 and delivered FIFO net operating profit growth within our 3% to 5% target range shared at Investor Day. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.19, the middle of our guidance range. Finally, we generated strong adjusted free cash flow, which we have used to pay down debt and bring our leverage ratio to within our target range and reintroduced share repurchasing in the fourth quarter. \n Now I'd like to provide commentary on Kroger's fourth quarter results. We delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57 per diluted share of 18.8%. LIFO charge for the quarter was $36 million compared to a LIFO credit of $10 million for the same period last year. This increase was driven by higher inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. Our corporate tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.2% compared to 20.8% for the same period last year. This decrease resulted from an increase in tax deductions. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the fourth quarter was $758 million, up 20.7% compared to $628 million in the fourth quarter in 2018. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 2% during the fourth quarter. Several departments outperformed in our supermarket business, including produce, key beverage categories, pharmacy and natural foods. \n The underlying trends in the business was strong. November and December identical sales were consistent with third quarter performance. As expected, January was negatively impacted as we lapped incremental SNAP dollars in the market in January 2019 and we experienced milder weather this year. February bounced back nicely and performed in line with our expectations and slightly ahead of the trend in the third quarter and November and December. As a reminder, we do expect SNAP to positively impact the first quarter of 2020 as we lap a 15 basis point headwind from prior year. We expect identical sales in 2020 to improve over 2019 as we drive increased customer loyalty through fresh, Our Brands, personalization and seamless. \n Digital contributed approximately 75 basis points to identical sales without fuel. Kroger pickup and delivery continue to grow in a faster pace than our overall digital growth. During the 2019 holiday season, we offered a limited time free pickup promotion in select markets. Customers responded positively to the promotion, and we were pleased with our fourth quarter digital sales growth of 22%. \n Gross margin was 22.1% of sales for the fourth quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 6 basis points. This increase resulted from improvements in cost of goods, accelerated alternative to profit streams and cycling of investments in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offset by investments in price and personalization, continued industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and growth in the specialty pharmacy business. Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the fourth quarter compared to last year. This represents the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement. While retail pharmacy gross margin continued to be a headwind in the fourth quarter, retail pharmacy remains an important part of our strategy and continues to generate good returns and strong customer loyalty. \n OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 79 basis points in the quarter. Part of this was due to cycling of investments in OG&A made in the fourth quarter of 2018, plus broad-based improvements in Restock Kroger savings initiatives. We were pleased with our ability to deliver OG&A improvement above the level of gross margin investment as a rate of sales in 2019, and we expect that balance to continue in 2020. \n Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement. Our loyal customers received hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards in 2019 in the form of price discounts at the pump. The average retail price of fuel was $2.58 this quarter versus $2.34 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the fourth quarter was $0.33 compared to $0.34 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger's sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the fourth quarter. \n Alternative profit streams contributed an incremental operating profit of more than $100 million in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance continued to be the primary drivers of growth. Brands continue to invest in Kroger Precision Marketing because we close the loop between media exposure and store and digital sales to make brand advertising more addressable, actionable and accountable. An annual survey by the Path to Purchase Institute gave us strong ratings for effective targeting, measurement, sales growth and ROI. Most recently, we became the first retail media platform to be awarded Platinum Certification by the Trustworthy Accountability Group for meeting guidelines to improve transparency and prevent ad fraud, malware and piracy. We're committed to being the most transparent media organization and making the entire digital media ecosystem a safe and effective investment for CPG brands. \n As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Memphis during the fourth quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas and Houston. Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations in 2020, including contracts with UFCW for store associates in Dallas, Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Fry's associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. \n We continue to generate strong free cash flow and are being very disciplined in how we deploy it to deliver strong and attractive total shareholder returns. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintain our current investment-grade debt rating and return excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend. In 2019, Kroger reduced our net total debt by $1.1 billion, bringing our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA within our target range. We also returned $486 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $400 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2019 under our $1 billion Board authorization. \n At our Investor Day, we committed to continue to apply a rigorous and disciplined approach to capital management, and we are focused on ensuring our capital projects deliver strong returns. Consistent with our approach in 2019, the majority of our investments in 2020 will be allocated to driving profitable sales growth, improving productivity and building out our supply chain and seamless ecosystem. We also committed to effectively manage our portfolio of assets to improve ROIC over time. \n As part of our review process in the fourth quarter, we recognized an impairment charge relating to the planned closing of 35 stores across the footprint in 2020. This is reflected in the $52 million of transformation costs recognized during the fourth quarter. As we have shared with you previously, Kroger made the decision to divest our interest in Lucky's Market in the third quarter of 2019, and we took the appropriate impairment charge based on the information available at that time. Subsequently, the decision was made by Lucky's Markets to file for bankruptcy in January, which led us to fully write off the value of our investment and deconsolidate Lucky's Market from our consolidated financial statements. This resulted in a noncash charge of $174 million in the fourth quarter. \n Kroger maintains liabilities associated with certain property-related guarantees that will result in Kroger making payments to settle these over time. These items have no effect on net earnings per diluted share or adjusted free cash flow guidance for 2020. \n Turning now to guidance for 2020, building on our momentum in 2019, we continue to expect identical sales without fuel of greater than 2.25%. We also continue to expect adjusted FIFO operating profit of $3 billion to $3.1 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to range between $2.30 and $2.40. Looking at the cadence of EPS growth in 2020, we expect the first quarter to be below our annual EPS growth range of 5% to 10% as we cycle real estate gains in the first quarter of 2019. Overall, I'm encouraged with the momentum created in 2019, which provides a solid platform from which to deliver on our commitments in 2020. \n Now I'll turn it back to Rodney. Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Robbie. So yes, as you think about the model for 2020, I'll maybe refer back a little bit to some of the things that we talked about at Investor Day. We very much look at the overall customer ecosystem across our food and grocery business, retail pharmacy business and also the fuel business as an overall how do we manage those multifaceted parts of the model. And I think if you look at our performance in 2019, as I've said in some of the prepared comments, we feel like it's a really good demonstration of how we're managing that model where, really, the pharmacy headwinds that we saw in 2019 were fully offset by the fuel benefits that we saw. And then the sort of foundational food and grocery business was pretty stable within that environment. \n I would say that as we look towards 2020, we'll be managing the business in a very similar way. When you think about our overall guidance for 2020, we're essentially expecting that ecosystem to be relatively stable overall, and alternative profit will drive us towards the operating profit growth that we've shared for the full year. Within that guidance, we do expect that pharmacy will continue to have some headwinds, nothing to the extent that we saw in 2019. We think the gross margin structural challenges will continue in 2020. But the team has done a great job in continuing to look for opportunities to take out costs where they don't add value for the customer, our associates and looking for ways to improve our cost of goods where we have control over those items. And so we would expect to see less of a headwind, albeit still somewhat of a headwind from pharmacy in 2020. We would also expect fuel, obviously, to start to normalize. And so probably something of a headwind there within the overall model. And really, the way that we cycle those will be through the strength of continuing to improve our ID sales in the core and the $1 billion of cost savings that I talked about overall within the model. So overall, we think about it very much as all those moving parts creating a relatively stable core business from an operating profit point of view in 2020 and alternative profits driving the growth in the year. Yes. I would completely agree with your comment, Rodney, as I think it's really too early for us to really have a sense of how customers' overall behavior will change and what the impact will be as the situation obviously evolves in the U.S. market. \n I guess just to build on a couple of points, Ken, with the data points that we do see today. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, February was generally in line with what we've expected for the period of the first month, if you like, around new year. So we didn't see anything dramatically different from what we would've expected during that time period. Certainly, the trend has improved over -- slightly over what we saw in Q3 and November and December. So we will have to see that after January was a month that we knew would be a tough one to cycle. And as Rodney mentioned, in the last few days, I think you've seen more in response to the media activity and some of the advice out there in the market of customers starting to spend more on things like water and hand sanitizer, hand soap, paper and then some of the -- maybe the box dinners and soups that you might expect just based on the guidance that's been given to consumers in the market. So there's certainly been heightened activity in that regard. \n But how that plays out and how it impacts the overall shape of the way customers behave and shop, I think it's really that should be. And I think in the last few days that I would say there's anything different than we would have seen versus what we expected. And how that plays out over a longer period of time is really, I think, impossible to tell. Yes. Sure. And thank you for the question. Yes, it's -- it is an area, Ken, where we saw some lumpiness during the year. Part of that is to do with the fact that as we've been dynamically changing our capital allocation, the average life of some of the investments that we make in technology look different from some of the traditional investments that we would've made in a traditional store remodel or a new store opening. We're still investing in those areas, but the mix is certainly changing over time. As that normalizes out, we would be looking at a range of 3% to 5% as a sort of an annualized increase in depreciation to kind of give you more of a big picture perspective on how to think about 2020, if that's helpful. Sure. Thanks for the question. It's -- I think I've talked a little bit about it at the Investor Day and then in the prepared comments. What we're really focused on is taking a step back and making sure as we think about how the overall portfolio of assets are performing, how do we make sure we're really setting ourselves, that we're making the right investments to accelerate and grow the business but also looking where we have opportunities to optimize the portfolio and to drive, obviously, ROIC over a period of time. \n I would say that this is very much a sort of a stand-alone review that we've taken a step back and said -- look at stores where -- and the average -- to give you some context around it, the average store age is about 28 years old. So these are, in many cases, older stores. They're geographically spread across the countries. There aren't sort of particular markets that it's focused on. It's very much more about looking at our portfolio and really making sure that we see where the customer is going, where we invest our dollars to really drive and support our customers and how we continue to evolve the whole ecosystem that Rodney referred to in his opening comments, just making sure that we're really being disciplined in investing where we see the future growth in the business. And so it's one of those things that just as part of as we manage the business and look for ways to continue to improve and optimize, we're looking to be very deliberate in making those decisions. Sure. Thanks, Rodney. And obviously, I would agree with everything you shared there. I think one of the key things that the team is focused on is really working collaboratively across Stuart Aitken's team, that leads the Media group, and then Joe Grieshaber's team, that leads our merchandising capabilities, to make sure that we really are managing all the moving pieces together. And I would say we feel very good around how those relationships are working to make sure that we're capturing the dollars and really helping support our CPG partners to grow their business effectively through the work that we do in the merchandising group and also through the alternative profit streams with the Media business. \n I wouldn't say that we see anything that's causing us to believe that as the way this is being managed, that they are very much discrete buckets that are generally being allocated to particular activities. We feel very positive about the progress that we're making there on how we see -- I would probably characterize it as how we see a shock in cost of goods and how it flows through to the gross margin. I would say it's one of the reasons that we called it out in the quarter earnings release of -- we certainly continue to invest in price and personalization for our customers. But the combination of cost of goods benefits and alternative profit streams fully offset that in terms of the impact on gross margin and part of the reason why we were able to see a solid performance on gross margin during the quarter. I think certainly, our assumption in the model is that we expect -- continue to see pressure in certain parts of the way the pharmacy business is structured. Our focus is on really making sure that we're continuing to improve our operation in a way that ensures that, in addition to all the great things that our pharmacy business do for us today around driving overall customer loyalty and delivering a great experience in the store for customers, that we continue to evolve the way we think about the business model. \n I mentioned some of the things in one of the earlier comments around how we're taking costs out of the model where that makes sense and doesn't create value for our associates working in that part of the business or for our customers. We've launched a number of new services, like the Kroger's pharmacy program that allows us to be able to deliver more value for the customer, but also to be able to influence more of the dynamics of how the profitability works in the marketplace and to really deliver more value for customers through that program. \n And then I think the third piece that we talked a little bit about, I think, on a previous call is we truly believe that the power of our data and the overall relationship that we have with the customer potentially opens up opportunities to develop new revenue streams in connecting food to how we deliver our health and wellness services in the store, so thinking about the trend towards food as medicine and how can we connect those relationships even more clearly to help our customers live and eat more healthily when they want to do that, but also to connect into the health care system and helping to take out some of the cost and complexity in that model and generate new revenue streams. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. So obviously, I mentioned a little bit around this in the prepared comments. We committed that as we continue to see strong free cash flow generation, which is a core part of our total shareholder return model, we are committed to continuing to buy back stock as part of the model. As you know, we had a $1 billion authorization from the Board. And as long as we continue to deliver on the performance of the business that we expect and generate the strong free cash flow that we've guided to during the year while also maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio within that target range to support our commitment to our investment-grade rating, we would expect to be continuing to buy back stock within the overall authorization that we have. \n I would say that the way that we're approaching it is very much in a structured way. We're not specifically trying to time the market in some way. It's much more based on a grid approach to how we determine and look at the intrinsic value of the stock. And then we'll put a grid in place to make sure that, over time, if there are opportunities to buy back, we will certainly be executing on that plan throughout the year. Sure. Thanks, Chris. Yes. So as we mentioned in some of the prepared comments, that the quarter 4 result obviously did include some cycling of increased investment that we made in Q4 2018. And so some of that is certainly expected, and I know we guided to that as part of what we shared in the EPS expectations when we shared what we thought the cadence would look like throughout 2019. \n We're really seeing the improvements across a broad wave of activity across Restock Kroger. I listed out many of them in the prepared comments, whether it's -- some of the biggest areas would be in goods not for resale as example, where we're sourcing products better and we're managing to really make sure that we're finding opportunities to be more efficient in the way that we're buying and joining the dots across all the different pieces of procurement across the organization. \n Certainly, we're leveraging technology and automation to make sure that we're taking work away where it doesn't add value for the customer. A good example of that might be in cleaning, where it's something that can be done more efficiently and allow our associates to really focus on serving the customer and doing work that the customer really values. \n And then of course, we did announce last quarter that we did make some structural changes to really simplify the work in our divisional offices to make sure that we're, again, putting our associates and talent closer to the customer in these key store management roles and, at the same time, reducing duplication in work so they can make decisions more quickly and respond and serve the customer more effectively. \n So I think we feel very good about it. It's a good balance across the way that we're managing the cost base. Certainly, as we look at the performance of our stores, one of the things that -- building on maybe Rodney's comment to the last question that was asked around confidence in the model, we're very excited about as we see our stores continue to execute at a higher level and continuing to deliver improvements in the fresh experience, the friendly experience and our in-stock position and how we're delivering on Kroger pickup. So we're very focused on making sure our stores are in a good place to be able to deliver on the experience that we know our customers are looking for. And some of those are the reasons why we feel confident as we're guiding to higher ID sales in 2020, because of the great work our store associates are doing in delivering for our customers. \nChris  Mandeville: Okay. And then just my follow-up, it's maybe a little bit too early. But in the areas where we've seen some of the natural organics, not named Lucky's shutter and then with Ahold Delhaize pulling Peapod out of the Midwest, have you realized any benefits already? Or maybe you could just talk about how you're planning to be positioned to capitalize on the share being up for grabs? No. I would agree with your points, Rodney. I think in terms of the cost savings, as you mentioned it, for me, many of the opportunities that we still see out there are around how we can continue to use technology more effectively and really simplify the design of the work to make it easier for our associates to be successful in the role. And that often means, as you know, John, is we're often reinvesting them in other areas of the store experience and the digital experience. So that net-net, it doesn't necessarily translate through to a total saving in cost because what we're often doing is redeploying those savings into new ways to either improve the experience or to meet the customer where they're at. So it is -- back to Rodney's comment on the what's inflation versus what's incremental is a little bit more difficult as the world's get blurrier around what are the minimum expectations of the customer and where things like average wage going in the marketplace. Yes. Thanks for the question, John. It's -- yes, that's a good call. Actually, that would be very true in the way you characterized it. So we've really just then got off the ground with that part of the partnership. As you know, the retail test that we have in market have now been going for some time, and we've been pleased with the progress there. And we continue to develop our thinking around how to connect more detail with the customer and fulfill on that convenient shopping experience. The group purchasing organization part of it is very much in its infancy stage. We've just started to work on where the opportunities are there, and that would certainly be part of the tailwinds into 2020 and beyond in driving more efficiency and cost savings."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to The Kroger Company Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on the business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.\n Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks for this conference will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]\n I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2019 results is Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip.\n I would like to thank those of you who were able to attend our investor conference last month where we shared our progress on Restock Kroger. We believe that Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders. It provides us with a clear purpose and our vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. It focuses us on redefining the customer experience, identifying the partners who will help us deliver customer value today and in the future and putting the right talent and teams in place to focus on growth in our supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses.\n We are proud of the progress we have made, and we've learned from the challenges we've experienced. We are on track with a stable and growing supermarket business as a result of our customer obsession, renewed intensity around operational excellence and continued investment in seamless. We are growing our supermarket business by focusing on 3 levers to drive identical sales: fresh, power brands and data and personalization. And we continue to build a seamless ecosystem that is available, relevant and accessible for our customers. All of this combined to generate positive results in the third quarter.\n We continued to grow identical sales, reduce costs and deliver strong free cash flow. We had a broad-based identical sales improvement. 15 of our divisions had increasing supermarket identical sales without fuel compared to the second quarter. We delivered a slightly improved FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Headwinds in pharmacy were offset by strong fuel performance during the quarter. We are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth.\n Kroger continues to invest in digital as we build a seamless ecosystem for our customers. We know our customers value greater convenience this provides, and our data shows it's an essential component of growing overall loyalty. Digitally engaged customers not only drive growth through our digital modalities, they also help drive brick-and-mortar sales growth as well and share of wallet. So seamless is a both, not an either/or.\n Our data clearly shows that over time and after initial investments, the profitability of a digital customer is the same as an in-store customer. We continue to see an improving operating profit trend in digital, and therefore, our investments are maturing as expected and consistent with the graph we shared at Investor Day.\n Our digital sales grew 21% in the third quarter. As we shared previously, we expect our digital sales growth to moderate year-over-year primarily due to the cycling of Home Chef and as a result of our disciplined focus on growing the Ship customer. We have expanded our digital coverage to reach 96% of our customers. This means that 96% of our customers who shop Kroger in a brick-and-mortar store can also shop with us for pickup or delivery.\n We continue to invest in digital platforms as this is where the customers are increasingly going to meet many of their needs. Providing our customers with the ability to have anything, anytime, anywhere from Kroger sets us apart from a large segment of our competitors and will drive loyalty as well as our long-term growth and margin expansion.\n We continue the rollout of Ocado facilities. In November, Kroger announced plans for a new high-tech customer fulfillment center in Wisconsin. The automated warehouse will serve customers in Wisconsin, Northern Illinois and Northwest Indiana. What's so exciting about Ocado is their model to deliver to the customer is significantly less costly than our existing model and any of the other models we've examined as well. Not only will these facilities accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience, they will also help us to do it in a much more cost-effective way. We know Ocado's value is not just its current capabilities but also how quickly the company is able to innovate to serve a rapidly developing online consumer market. One of the comments we made at IR Day is that Ocado keeps learning and improving their model. Ocado's recent announcement of a micro fulfillment center in Bristol is a good example of this.\n We believe that the food industry is special. It is huge, a $1.5 trillion market. And not only do people need to eat, they love to eat. Food isn't a commodity, but it's the center of our lives. Customers deserve a partner like Kroger who can provide inspiration and fulfill their passion for food. And unlike our national competitors, Kroger is food first. We believe that no matter who you are, where you're from, how you shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have affordable, easy-to-enjoy fresh food that tastes amazing.\n As we shared in November, fresh is an important driver of sales for Kroger. Our fresh departments drive trips, loyalty and gross margin. Our product standards, selection criteria and supply chain are core strengths and are built to deliver first-to-market and best-of-season fresh products across the United States.\n Our produce department led the way in sales for the quarter, demonstrating how our store teams are focused on improving everyday execution in ways that are highly relevant to our customers. In addition, we launched our Fresh for Everyone brand transformation campaign, and the initial feedback from both our customers and our associates is very positive.\n One of the many ways we demonstrate our passion for food is through Kroger's best-in-class Our Brands portfolio. While many grocers offer private label products, Our Brands is a real differentiator for Kroger because our customers tell us through blind taste tests that Our Brands' quality is better than not only the competitors' private label products but also many leading national brands as well. Kroger's Our Brands grew 3.4% this quarter. We also introduced 231 new Our Brand items during the third quarter.\n Kroger's third differentiating lever to drive identical sales growth is personalization. Data is a differentiator for Kroger. Many retailers have transactional data, but none have the customer data and the insights to make meaningful suggestions to their customers like Kroger. We continue to see incredible effectiveness and efficiency from a focus on loyal customers and investing in their satisfaction.\n One specific area I'd like to highlight is our strong fuel points program. As we shared at the Investor Day conference last month, an amazing 83% of our loyal customers engage with our fuel rewards program each year. We are increasingly targeting promotion and personalization of fuel rewards, and fuel drove trips and sales in the third quarter.\n We are using the power of Kroger's stable and growing supermarket business to create meaningful incremental operating profit through the alternative profit stream businesses, which adds up to a business built for long-term growth that generates consistently attractive total shareholder returns.\n Kroger continues to generate strong and durable free cash flow as reflected by the fact that the company has reduced debt by $1.5 billion over the prior 4 quarters and continues to increase its dividend to create value for shareholders. We are confident that we can deliver even stronger TSR in the future because of our strong free cash flow and sustainable net earnings growth.\n Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders both today and the future.\n And now I will turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. I want to echo Rodney and thank those of you who were able to attend or view the Investor Day webcast last month. As we shared in New York, our model for a strong and durable retail supermarket business begins with the customer and our obsession with increasing customer loyalty. We believe that our intensified focus on execution and continued improvements in the value and experience we deliver for our customers is driving increased identical sales across our store and digital ecosystem.\n To drive sustainable sales growth for the long term, we will continue to invest in areas of the business that are important to the customer. This includes ongoing investments in talent, price, digital and store experience, with an even greater emphasis on fresh, Our Brands and personalization. We are demonstrating through the first 3 quarters of the year we are being very deliberate in balancing these investments with disciplined execution of cost savings that simplify our business.\n Our supermarket business and the traffic and data this generates serves as the foundation from which we are able to drive higher growth in our asset-light, margin-rich alternative profit businesses that we continue to expect to accelerate our results. We expect our model to deliver improved operating results over time and continued strong free cash flow, and we expect this to translate into a consistently strong and attractive total shareholder return through EPS growth driven by sustained net earnings growth and the return of cash to shareholders via share repurchase, plus a growing dividend over time.\n Now I'd like to share third quarter results. For the quarter, we delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.47 per diluted share. As noted in this morning's press release, that includes a $0.03 out-of-period charge that I will share more detail on in a moment. But first, I'll highlight a few areas of our business that were particularly robust.\n Our Brands contributed as both a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the third quarter, and our fuel performance mitigated retail pharmacy gross margin headwinds in the quarter.\n LIFO charge for the quarter was $23 million compared to $12 million for the same period last year driven by inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. We now estimate LIFO for the year to be approximately $90 million versus our original expectation of $50 million.\n Our adjusted corporate tax rate for the quarter was 70 basis points higher than the same period last year due to a decrease in the benefits of federal tax credits and an increase in reserves.\n I'll now provide additional detail about 2 specific items that affected our results in the third quarter. First, the out-of-period charge of $29 million that I referenced earlier. This charge is related to a provision in a single pharmacy contract that should have been recognized over the previous 6 quarters. Given the complexity of the contract and the introduction of new clawback provisions, a part of the contract was misinterpreted. The required correction was identified in our standard management review process. This charge is not material to total company results, and the financial effect in each of the prior individual quarters was immaterial to net earnings per diluted share. However, the cumulative effect on our performance in the third quarter reduced adjusted net earnings per diluted share by $0.03 and gross margin by 9 basis points. We, therefore, felt it was important to provide a greater level of insight into this item. There is no effect on earnings guidance for 2019 or 2020 as a result of this contract going forward.\n I'd now like to talk about Lucky's Market. During our investor conference last month, we committed to continue to be disciplined in prioritizing capital allocation to improve return on invested capital and create sustainable shareholder return. As part of a portfolio review, we made the decision to evaluate strategic alternatives in relation to our investment in Lucky's Market. As a result of this review, the company has decided to divest its interest in Lucky's Market and recognized an impairment charge of $238 million in the third quarter. Accounting rules require Kroger to record the gross amount in operating profit. However, the real economic interest to Kroger is a pretax charge of $131 million. Additional details are provided in the financial tables of our press release.\n The impairment charge is a noncash charge and reflects the write-down of our initial investment in Lucky's Market as well as additional funding provided to operate and grow the business. There is no effect on earnings guidance for 2020 as a result of this decision.\n Turning now to some of the highlights in the third quarter as underlying trends were very robust. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 2.5% during the third quarter, marking our strongest quarter since we launched Restock program. Several supermarket departments outperformed the company, including produce, key beverage categories, pharmacy and natural foods. Digital contributed approximately 70 basis points to identical sales, with Kroger pickup and delivery continuing to show strong momentum.\n Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the third quarter was $653 million compared to $664 million in the third quarter of 2018. Gross margin was 22.1% of sales for the third quarter.\n FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 24 basis points from the same period last year primarily driven by industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and continued growth in our specialty pharmacy business.\n Gross margin rate, excluding fuel and pharmacy, improved slightly in the quarter as cost of goods savings and growth in alternative businesses offset continued retail price investments.\n While profitability in retail pharmacy is lower than we had budgeted this year, it remains an important part of our strategy and continues to generate good returns. We were pleased to see the decline in gross margin rate compared to last year was lower in the third quarter than the first 2 quarters of 2019, and this trend is expected to continue in quarter 4.\n As a result of continued growth in pharmacy sales, improved product sourcing and initiatives that lower the cost of fill trips, our expectation is that pharmacy profitability will be less of a headwind in 2020.\n Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the third quarter compared to last year. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement.\n OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 15 basis points. This was achieved through broad-based improvement of Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives.\n We remain on track to achieve over $1 billion of cost savings in 2019 on top of the $1 billion savings achieved last year. We also have clear line of sight to the $1 billion of incremental savings in 2020 that we shared at our investor conference. These savings are being achieved through improved productivity and automation, elimination of waste, improved sourcing of goods not for resale and administrative efficiencies.\n Like many industries, grocery retail is navigating through disruptive change. As part of the company's ongoing evolution, store operating divisions recently evaluated and reduced middle management roles to ensure they have the right talent in the right roles closest to our customers in store leadership positions. As a result, Kroger incurred severance charges in the third quarter totaling $80 million.\n Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, and our loyal customers continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards each year in the form of price discount at the pump. As Rodney mentioned, fuel is driving lower customer trips and sales, and the amount of fuel rewards paid to loyal customers increased by 8% in the third quarter.\n The average retail price of fuel was $2.62 this quarter versus $2.81 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the third quarter was $0.30 compared to $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger's sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the third quarter.\n Alternative profit streams are on track to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance continue to be the primary drivers of growth this year.\n Kroger Precision Marketing continues to build momentum, increasing engagement to over 1,000 brands with a 90% retention rate and significantly higher spend. We have relationships with all major agency holding companies supporting their media activations as they deploy brand-building programs. Our Media business continues to release new inventory and create new publisher relationships to support the demand of advertisers.\n And now to update on labor relations. As we have previously shared, we are proud that our average hourly rate is over $20 with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. As a result of Kroger's investments in our associates, we are improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development.\n We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Southern California, Portland, Seattle and Michigan during the quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas and Memphis. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant today to associates. \n Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\n A key element of our capital allocation strategy is to use our free cash flow to invest in the business and drive profitable growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals.\n We committed to prioritize free cash flow in 2019 to reduce the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to within our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Over the last 12 months, net total debt has reduced by $1.5 billion, and Kroger's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.5 for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2.72 a year ago. We remain committed to our target net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range.\n Now that we are operating within our target range, and as we expect to generate strong free cash flow, we anticipate starting to buy back shares in the fourth quarter under our $1 billion Board authorization. This is not expected to have a material impact on fourth quarter EPS.\n Turning now to guidance for 2019. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.25% in 2019. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019.\n We expect underlying identical sales growth in the fourth quarter will be similar to third quarter. However, incremental SNAP dollars that were in the market in January 2019 represent about a 50% -- 50 basis point -- excuse me, 50 basis point headwind in the quarter. We, therefore, anticipated reported ID sales will be towards the lower end of our 2019 guidance range for quarter 4 as we cycle the effect of SNAP.\n We continue to expect the fourth quarter to deliver double-digit EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Where we land with our adjusted EPS annual guidance range will be heavily influenced by fuel margins in the fourth quarter, which were at record highs in quarter 4 last year. Our customers' shopping behaviors affected by the lower SNAP dollars in market in January will also influence the outcome.\n As you know, we typically share annual guidance when we report our fourth quarter results in March. But this year, we provided guidance for 2020 several months early. We remain confident in the 2020 guidance that we shared last month at our Investor Day in New York.\n And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. As I shared when we first began the call, we believe that Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business and create value for all of our stakeholders. We are on track with a stable and growing grocery business as a result of our customer obsession, renewed intensity around operational excellence and continued development of our seamless ecosystem. Our focus on the fundamentals generated positive results in our supermarket business in the third quarter, which gives us strong momentum heading into the holiday season.\n Now we look forward to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: I just wanted to start with a question on the Q4 outlook. So you have a fairly wide range. That, I guess, implies earnings growth anywhere from sort of like mid-singles all the way up over 20%. One question, I think, that I have related to this is what are the puts and takes around that range? And I know you mentioned fuel, but a second question related to that is that to get to these numbers sort of either way, you need core grocery earnings to improve, and that's despite what is a harder comparison on SNAP and quite frankly recent pressure in grocery. So can you just kind of walk us through those puts and takes and then what you think will drive core grocery earnings to inflect positively in Q4? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll cover that. So you're correct, we expect -- as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we are expecting adjusted EPS growth to be in the double digits in the fourth quarter. Obviously, as I mentioned a moment ago, we're assuming and expecting identical sales growth to be in the range in the quarter, continuing the sort of trend that we saw in Q3, but there will be some SNAP headwinds that will bring it down towards the lower end of the range. So that's the kind of core assumption around ID sales for the quarter.\n We do cycle some investments. In Q4 last year, if you recall that we set up costs around some facilities in D.C. So from a gross margin perspective, we do have some tailwinds that will help the quarter. We also expect to continue to see the cost-saving improvements that we've been accelerating throughout the year as we continue to execute on the $1 billion cost-saving plan. And of course, I think we shared on previous quarters that alternative profit streams tends to be skewed more towards the fourth quarter, predominantly because both KPS has a heavy fourth quarter influence on the results and then Media continues to accelerate, and Q4 is always a higher Media quarter as well. So you combine an accelerating rate and the fact that Media is higher in the fourth quarter helps the alternative profit part of the business to continue to grow.\n In terms of the sort of puts and takes in the quarter that could influence where we finish in the range, on the headwind side, obviously, we have been investing in a new brand launch, and we're obviously spending dollars there in continuing to improve the messaging and translating that into a connection with our customers. We also launched the promotion on free pickup for the quarter as well and seeing how that plays out in terms of customer behavior. And then, of course, we also have the fuel headwind in the fourth quarter where our rate was $0.34, which was a record high last year. So those would be the headwinds that we're pushing against versus the assumptions I mentioned earlier.\n The unknowns around the range, really, with fuel being a record high in the fourth quarter last year, if fuel performs in line with where it's been on average for the year-to-date position, it would obviously be at a certain level. If it was -- which is a $0.29 to $0.30 range, if it was at the similar level as last year at $0.34, that makes a meaningful difference to how the quarter ends. And then, of course, seeing how customers behave as a result of the SNAP dollars not being in market in January is a further factor in really causing us to leave the range as wide as it is. But we do feel confident in the way we see the model in the fourth quarter, which is why we still believe double-digit growth in the earnings per share is what we'd expect to achieve. \nEdward Kelly: And just a follow-up. It seems like what's new in terms of what we're learning in the guidance this quarter is it -- I guess it seems like there's a $0.03 pharmacy charge that's in the guidance given that it's in your $0.47. Your LIFO charge is going up by $0.04. So that seems to be something that's a bit more unexpected. What's offsetting that to allow you to maintain guidance? \nW. McMullen: Ed, this is Rodney. Just a couple of comments, and I'll let Gary fill in. Obviously, our identicals continue to improve and strong there. If you look at gross margin without fuel and pharmacy, a slight improvement there. We had great balance between cost improvements and gross investment and it's the continuation of those pieces coming together. So it's really -- the core business continuing to improve and move in the right direction, that's providing the tailwind to offset the $0.03 on the pharmacy that was out-of-a-quarter adjustment and the LIFO as well. I don't know, Gary, anything? \nGary Millerchip: I would completely agree with you, Rodney. I think the key thing for us is that, to your point, that those headwinds, even with those headwinds, if you strip those back in the quarter and look at Q3, underlying EPS and operating profit would have been positive excluding the out-of-period adjustment, as Rodney mentioned. Obviously, ID sales was very positive during the quarter. But we mentioned on the call, we didn't include it in the press release, but the impact of the out-of-period on gross margin rate was 9 basis points. So actually, in the quarter, gross margin rate, even with the pharmacy headwinds that we called out, would have been balanced with OG&A improvements over 15. So we were 24 basis points reported gross margin decline, excluding fuel. Taking out those 9 basis points, you get to the 15 basis points of underlying, if you like, gross margin investment after the -- excluding the onetime -- sorry, the out-of-period adjustment.\n So when we look at 15 basis points of investment, including pharmacy headwinds that we faced and we achieved 15 basis points of OG&A improvement, we actually feel like the progress that we're seeing in the model has been masked quite a bit in the quarter and we feel very positive about the underlying trends that we're seeing in the business. \nOperator: The next question is from Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nJudah Frommer: Maybe first, just following up on fuel. Can you help us with the benefit you're getting from improved sourcing and the sustainability of that relative to just kind of a general step higher in industry profitability and how that's playing out? \nW. McMullen: It's a combination of really some technology investments that we've made in terms of how to buy fuel and making sure, from a market standpoint, how we're pricing on a daily basis and reacting to what our competitors are doing. So it's the benefit of the way fuel is being bought plus being much more disciplined relative to the market. So it's really the combination of those.\n In terms of expectations going forward, from a procurement standpoint, we don't believe that's something that will continue to incrementally get better. We do believe it's something that we'll be able to maintain, and it's something that we've reflected in our guidance going forward. \nJudah Frommer: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up on the Lucky's write-down. I don't think it was that long ago that you guys were citing double-digit IDs at Lucky's and great trends in produce. Maybe just a little bit more on the decision to exit the investment, the write-down of the investment. And is there any commentary on that kind of subchannel of food retail, kind of the specialized fresh-led food retailers and smaller boxes that's causing you to say maybe the traditional larger store fresh-led format is the way to go? \nW. McMullen: Yes, it really gets back to Gary's comments in the prepared remarks is -- and we talked about at Investor Day, it's really reviewing our whole portfolio of things that we are involved with and working on. And it really -- the amount of investment that it would take for Lucky's to be a meaningful contributor to Kroger overall and the efforts that it would take, we just didn't think it created a good return for the investments that were needed to be made relative to that. So it was really driven by narrowing our focus and the additional requirements to make it something that would be meaningful to Kroger. I don't know, Gary, you've been more on a day-to-day basis involved, anything you want to add? \nGary Millerchip: I don't -- I think you characterized it well, Rodney. I think the only thing maybe to build in the second part of the question, I -- we do believe that as we get better connecting on fresh and continue to evolve the strategy around natural and organic, obviously, we're providing a far more comprehensive level of experience for that customer than ever before and continue to do more of that as we continue to build out the strategy around freshness and connecting with our loyal customers.\n We do believe that there's still a role for the small format store. I think it's certainly proven. And I think it's still probably to be proven in the industry about what is the right model for a smaller format store and how do you make that economic model work and how do you connect with the customer in a way that drives the right value on those smaller shopping trips as well. So we still believe and continue to look for opportunities. And obviously, our Walgreens pilot continues to provide an opportunity to learn how to continue to build a strategy that has a small format presence in there. But I do think it also demonstrates your comment that it's hard to figure out that small format model and to make it work effectively. \nOperator: The next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. \nCharles Cerankosky: Been looking at the Thanksgiving sales and how customers were spending, trading up. Can you talk about what that might mean for the Christmas selling season later this month? \nW. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Chuck. If you look at quarter-to-date, our identicals would be pretty similar to where we were in the third quarter. The balancing of it is significantly different than the last few years because, obviously, there's 1 less week between Thanksgiving and Christmas. If you look at the way how customers spend their money, we continue to see obviously strong on people trading up, strong performance in wine, cheese, all those types of categories, and we would certainly expect that to continue to stay consistent through Christmas as well. So we really expect the business to continue where it is through Christmas. Obviously, if you look at January of next year, it's really the SNAP cycling, the SNAP impact would affect the kind of the numbers that we've provided for guidance. \nCharles Cerankosky: Related to customers trading up, is that what you're trying to do when you invest in the customer experience? Prepared food strikes me you're making investments there. But are there other things we should think about? \nW. McMullen: Yes. It's fascinating because the customer is trading up both in terms of buying bigger package size. So what we find is when people are tied on budgets, they go to smaller package size. So we see people trading up there. We see people trading up to products that's better for you, natural and organic category. Prepared foods would be an area that we see people continuing to trade up for, and it's an area where we've focused a lot of attention on how do we get better. We view it as a huge opportunity to improve from where we are. And it's one of those things where we're just at the beginning part of that journey but certainly see customers very willing to pick up dinner at Kroger but do it with a Home Chef meal or something already prepared. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. \nAntonio Tabet: This is Antonio Tabet taking over for Mike Montani. I just wanted to ask something on the 4Q comp outlook. You guys are obviously cycling SNAP in January. But I'm curious as to what you're seeing so far now with the whole rebrand going on.\n And another follow-up to that is with the option of free pickup promotion going on right now until January 1, is there a possibility that, that stays? Or what are you seeing from that so far from the reception of customers? \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the outlook for the fourth quarter, so far in the quarter, we're tracking pretty similar to where we were in the third quarter. So it's really up until the SNAP period, we really don't see changes there.\n In terms of the pickup, free pickup option, we really aren't to a point yet of deciding whether to continue it or not. As you know, we've done it in several markets, and we're still early in the analysis. We -- the customer adoption has been stronger -- a little bit stronger than what we were expecting. But it's -- we're still at a point where we don't need to decide that yet in terms of whether we extend it or not. \nGary Millerchip: Just to add, Rodney, so it is literally a few weeks obviously into -- since we announced the promotion. It's interesting. We're seeing a combination of new customers starting to use the service as well as existing loyal Kroger shoppers using the service more frequently as well. So we'll be using all of that data, as you might expect, to really analyze and evaluate. And that's certainly a factor that could also influence how the quarter plays out in terms of sales, which is another reason why we're trying to be clear about sharing the different moving parts that could still affect the quarter. \nAntonio Tabet: Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the digital side. You guys grew digital sales 21% this quarter. And just the way we're thinking about it, for the full year, we're thinking somewhere in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion digital sales versus 2018 value somewhere around the baseline of $4 billion. So that implies around 31%, 30% year-over-year growth. Is that somewhat reasonable to think of? Or is that an attainable target? Just want to get your color on that. \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at it on a run rate basis, the numbers that you shared would be very consistent with what we see. The other thing I always think is important to remember that I mentioned on our digital business and Yael shared it on a graph is the profitability of that business is maturing as we expect. And if you look at the early adopters on digital, the profitability of that customer was the same as going in store because we get such a higher share of their total spend. And we continue to see that maturity happen as well, which, for us, is something that makes it a sustainable model longer term as well. \nGary Millerchip: Just one thing to add, Rodney, you said in your prepared comments and I mentioned it briefly as well, but I think we shared before that it really is the cycling of the Home Chef merger that caused the absolute percentage growth rate to show a declining trend. The underlying progress that we're seeing in customer engagement through Kroger pickup and delivery continues to be very strong and very consistent in the underlying results that we're seeing beyond the headline number. \nAntonio Tabet: Okay. And does that headwind continue to 4Q? \nGary Millerchip: We've cycled that now. So it kind of -- it was partly through Q3, so you have kind of roughly half of it in the -- sorry, partly through Q2, so roughly half of it in the second quarter, and now it's fully cycled through in Q3. I think Yael may have shared, too, at the investor conference that we expect the growth year-over-year going into 2020 to be in that 20% range, consistent with what we shared this quarter. \nOperator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Goldman: Rodney, thank you for the update on the quarter-to-date comp. Can you -- I know you probably will say no, you've never done this before. But just given some of the puts and takes for the fourth quarter, could you give us an update on sort of where you stand on your core gross margin quarter-to-date and your fuel margin as well? The reason I'm asking is there does seem to be a little bit of hesitation from some investors on your ability to sort of hit the high end of your guidance range for the fourth quarter. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. \nW. McMullen: Yes. The -- I really would just go back to the comments that Gary made before. If you look at the underlying supermarket business, it continues to be strong. Identicals continue to be strong. A very good balance between cost reductions and investments in service and growth. The biggest swing would be the fuel margin. And even internally, the swings can be so much from day-to-day that it's really -- the value of where we are quarter-to-date, I don't think it can change overnight. And I remember the other day being in a market where in the morning, the margins were $0.40. In the afternoon, the margins were $0.15. It's that type of swing. But when you look at overall, it's a great return and it creates a lot of customer loyalty.\n So -- and then the other piece is SNAP. So I don't know, Gary, if there's any additional insight. But to me, quarter-to-date, fuel margins are just kind of hard because it swings so much. \nGary Millerchip: Yes, I think that's right. And just to put the number into context, I mentioned it briefly earlier, but the rate that we've been trending at year-to-date in that $0.29-ish range, $0.34 was the Q4 rate last year. That $0.05 range can make a $50 million difference in terms of profitability. So -- and obviously, we have a very clear strategy of how we connect with customers on fuel and making sure that we're in line with the market. And so it is one of those areas where it can have a significant impact, and hence why I appreciate it does leave a much wider range than we normally want to, I think, have in place for the fourth quarter, and it's certainly not a lack of confidence in what we're seeing in the underlying core business, but it's just -- with that level of uncertainty out there on something like rates, it's -- we felt it was prudent to leave the range where it is. \nKenneth Goldman: I get that. And then my follow-up is, obviously, the government made some changes that are going to take some people in the America off food stamps, and it sounds like there's more of that coming. I'm curious, to what degree does your 2020 guidance factor that as a risk? Because, clearly, I think that if 700,000 or eventually some of the people think it will be closer to 3 million Americans get off food stamps, I can't say that as a positive for you, but I'm curious if there's any way to think about numerically how that might affect you? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question. Ken, obviously, it's something that we continue to watch very closely. And obviously, it's one of those things that we knew was a potential risk that's out there in the business, and we'll continue to watch it and evaluate. From our perspective, we really try and build the business model around being able to adapt to the circumstances, and we do believe that the model that we're creating and our ability to connect with customers and deliver an overall experience, the personalized pricing offers that we can generate that obviously are -- what we tend to see when customers have less dollars, they'll tend to gravitate more to own brand products, and you'll start to see some behavior shift. But because food is a nondiscretionary spend, usually, the customer is going to make adaptations that they have to, to be able to still buy the groceries that feed the family.\n So from our perspective, it's certainly something that we contemplate as a risk as we think through how we'll continue to build our model and drive connection with customers. And it's something that we'll continue to adapt as we hear more and learn when and if the changes occur. But obviously, it's one of those things out of our control. And our focus is much more on how do we make sure we win the customer and continue to adapt strategy if some of those things were to hit us as a headwind in 2020. \nW. McMullen: Yes. Just a couple of additions. Obviously, the overall economy continues to be strong as well, which provides support. And when you look at SNAP, we would be less dependent on SNAP than many of our competitors would be as well. \nOperator: The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nErica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Firstly, just wanted to touch on price investments. I think last quarter, you called out, I think it was about 12 basis points of price investment. Just curious if there was a similar level of price investments this quarter. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I don't think we've typically called out specifically price investments. What I would say in terms of maybe a couple of thoughts, when you think about gross margin and what happened in gross margin during the quarter, the way that -- to sort of break it down, if you like, and I covered a couple of these points earlier, but if you exclude fuel from the results, we had a 24 basis point investment in gross margin, 9 basis points of that related to the out-of-period charge that we shared in the press release this morning, which essentially brings it down to 15 basis points. All of that gross margin headwind was essentially in the health and wellness space between Kroger specialty pharmacy and retail pharmacy. And as Rodney mentioned, our gross margin rate overall improved slightly when you exclude pharmacy from the core business.\n So another way to say that is through the cost of goods savings that we were able to execute on during the quarter and the alternative profit growth that we were able to achieve during the quarter, which both support improvements in gross margin, we fully offset the continued price investments that we made in the business to drive the continued improvement in ID sales growth.\n We are continuing to invest in price. As we've shared, I think, at the Investor Day, a lot of our focus this year is on really making sure that we're using our data to drive the price investments in areas that matter most to our customers. And some of those are going to be personalized offers and promotions, but some of it will also be in fuel rewards. And we mentioned in the prepared comments that while the profitability of fuel improved during the quarter, that was offsetting the supermarket business by an 8% growth in the amount of fuel rewards that we paid to customers to incentivize them to continue buying Kroger.\n So it's a complex model in that sense, but we are continuing to invest in price. We're pleased with the way that customers are reacting to the investments that we're making because it's certainly allowing us as that one component of driving the identical sales growth that we shared in the quarter. But we're being very deliberate in balancing those investments with cost of goods savings and alternative profit growth. \nW. McMullen: Yes. The other thing that helped gross -- our shrink improved for the ninth consecutive quarter and warehousing and transportation costs improved as well. \nErica Eiler: Okay. That's helpful. And then you briefly mentioned the prepared food opportunity. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about your vision behind the recently announced ClusterTruck partnership? And does this at all impact how you're thinking about Home Chef? \nW. McMullen: I'll start with the end of your question first. It doesn't affect us how we look at Home Chef at all. And if you think about our overall strategy on trying to serve the customer anything they want, anytime they want, anywhere they want, as you know, about half of food is food already prepared where people spend their money. And our market share there is significantly less than on the traditional supermarket business. And we really view that it will be a combination of Home Chef, something physical in stores in terms of meals ready to heat, ready to eat. And ClusterTruck is one of those where we think it's an addition to that overall ecosystem. Obviously, they have incredibly good technology. It's made to order quickly. And they will be able to leverage -- and we're doing -- it's obviously on a test basis, they'll be able to leverage some of our physical assets to be able to scale as well.\n So it's really an additional piece in terms of how do we get the customers what they want, when they want it, the way they want it. And it's just an overall part of the overall ecosystem. And we just see the opportunity on food that's already prepared is a massive opportunity. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So you said you've been encouraged by some of the early learnings from your expansion of the free digital pickup initiative. Can you give us a sense for how that initiative has impacted the P&L? So is the financial performance in line with what you expected? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks for the question. Just recall, again, it is really early days in the journey with the promotion because we literally launched it a few weeks ago. And obviously, part of the modeling that you would expect us to do as we understand customer behavior is to look at -- as Kroger does on everything that we do, look at the longitudinal behavior with the customer and not just the individual transaction but how does that change the level of engagement with the customer, and that's going to need to happen over a longer period of time, as Rodney mentioned earlier.\n Certainly, the early encouraging signs are, as I mentioned, we're starting to see new customers experience the service and start to engage in Kroger pickup that haven't before. We're also seeing existing Kroger pickup customers start to increase the frequency with which they use pickup service. And so a lot of the financial modeling that we will do will really be looking at those metrics over a longer period of time and saying, how does that play out in terms of the value it creates and how does it drive loyalty. And then, of course, as we talked a little bit about at the investor conference, we'll look at that in the context of the investments that we're making in the business and how does customer value this part of the experience versus other ways in which we're creating value across price investments, across fuel discounts and obviously through the experience that we're offering in the store.\n So it's a pretty complex area. And certainly, we'll look at it over a longer period of time. We're seeing kind of the type of behavior we have expected to see, and it's certainly been positive. But it's really going to be a longer period of time before we could really evaluate the way in which it impacts the model with the customer. \nMichael Lasser: And just to clarify, Gary, you have assumed that in your 2020 guidance that you've provided, the test will be limited to 2019 so it will not continue into 2020 at this point. And then I have a quick follow-up. \nGary Millerchip: We haven't really gotten into specifics around what our pricing strategy will be in 2020. As we talked about, obviously, I would think about it more much as you think back to the chart that I shared at the investor meeting in New York and how we're balancing the investments that we're making in the cost savings in the business. So we certainly have a clear view of how much we believe we want to invest in the business next year and how that will be supported by the $1 billion of cost savings that we're expecting. So if we were going to see the value in pickup driving more value in our model, it would be because either we expect it to drive higher sales and support the investment or we believe it would be a better way to invest the dollars that we think are important to driving value for the customer in 2020. \nMichael Lasser: That's helpful. My follow-up question is, Rodney, you've seen some pretty good momentum in your ID sales. There's probably a variety of factors that are contributing to that, including a healthier overall environment, being further away from some of the disruptive changes that you've made and better execution in the business. If you had to rank those factors and maybe any others in order of importance and magnitude that they've contributed to driving this improvement, how would you do that? \nW. McMullen: Yes. The -- great question, Michael. We would really view those as pretty equal. The other thing that we would add on top of that is really using personalization and data to be more specific for each customer individually. So like on -- the example I gave on fuel rewards, but it would be true for offers more than just fuel rewards, but really personalizing it to each household individually. And it's really all of those -- we would call it, the sum of all parts. It's all of that together that's creating and improving the momentum. It's not just one single thing. \nOperator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nJoshua Kamboj: This is Josh Kamboj on for Simeon. So sales trends are improving and the grocery gross margin increased slightly in the quarter. How sustainable do you think that combination is in the near term? And then more broadly, what changes in the competitive landscape would you need to see to undergo a deeper round of price investments over the next 3 years than what's currently embedded in your plan? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think on the first part of the question, I would kind of draw back again to what we talked about at the investor conference. The way we think about the model going forward is, certainly, we're going to continue to invest in price. We're going to continue to invest in the customer experience because the long-term sustainable growth in loyalty, we think that's critical to our plan. What we're doing very deliberately is being very disciplined in how we're managing costs within the business, both cost of goods savings but also OG&A cost efficiency, which obviously was strong during the quarter. And then alternative profit streams continues to accelerate and obviously offset the gross margin investments that we're making as well.\n So I think we look at it much more of an overall ecosystem, if you like, is how do we use food as the foundation for customer loyalty, which drives the traffic. And then fuel obviously builds on that in terms of causing customers to shop more frequently. And then you think about the health and wellness business and alternative profit streams layering on together to create this overall ecosystem that drives customer loyalty and drives total profitability of the customer. And the way we think about it is how do we pull those levers together in a way that allows us to continue to invest and build loyalty. And we're using the different dynamics there around alternative profit and cost savings to be able to continue to invest.\n I think when we look at the market, certainly, obviously, there's always high competition. We expect that to continue. We always assume that within our model. And we feel very good about the plans that we're implementing around driving costs out and continue to grow alternative profit that we can make the investments that we need to, to be able to continue to grow customer loyalty. \nW. McMullen: Yes. I'd only add a couple of things. One, and Gary briefly mentioned it, if you look at continuing to learn to improve the customer experience, that provides support and ongoing support because we still -- we've made good progress, but we still see opportunities to get better.\n The one area that I've been pleasantly surprised, as you know, we've been able to -- in 2018, we were able to take over $1 billion of costs out. We're on track to exceed that again incrementally in 2019, and we have plans to do that in 2020 as well. We continue to see good opportunity to take costs out. And when you look at all those -- both those pieces together and the free cash flow of the business is what gives us confidence and comfort in the comment that Gary shared at the investor meeting of TSR of 8% to 11% per year. \nJoshua Kamboj: That's helpful. And then in general, maybe you could just quickly touch on your price gaps versus some of your key competitors. Have they been widening or narrowing? And are you pretty happy with where they sit at the moment? \nW. McMullen: Yes. One of the things that we always think it's important, we're comfortable where we are, but it's always important to remember that customers decide where to shop based on freshness of departments, and we shared with you that our customer feedback on fresh is better than our big box competitors. We also have tons of personalized offers where a customer gets value, both in terms of individual mailings, individual e-mails and fuel. So it's all of those pieces together, and we feel good about where we -- our gap is. \nOperator: And the last question will be from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: Just 2 follow-ups. Just the first on the LIFO increase, can you maybe just -- you mentioned procuring better, but LIFO is coming in higher than expected. I think in the press release, you guys called out grocery and dairy inflation. Is this all commodity driven? Or are CPG companies pushing through price increases? And then also, could you tell us what the inflation component of IDs was to the third quarter? So maybe just paint us a picture of what exactly is going on between all those things. \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes, it's an interesting question around LIFO and inflation because -- I'll maybe answer the 2 questions slightly differently. From an inflation point of view, as you know, we've shared before, we were assuming inflation in the range of 0% to 1% in the year. I would say it's trending slightly above that range. Actually, for Q3, I wouldn't say it's materially different than it was in Q2. There are a couple of categories like produce went slightly down and meat went slightly up, but nothing that would have been dramatic in terms of the overall change in inflation. So just slightly ahead of that 1% assumption that we had during the year. And actually, even though our LIFO charge forecasted increasing, we haven't really seen a dramatic change in the overall inflation rate across the categories. Everything I just said now I should probably caveat excludes fuel and pharmacy because those 2 obviously tend to have a different trajectory versus most of the food categories.\n Interesting -- with LIFO, it is a one data point in time at the end of the year that we follow to support the accounting rules that are in place around making that LIFO adjustment. With the data point that we used in the third quarter caused us to, in following that process, believe that we should increase the rate and based on what it's telling us, that's why we called out the forecast is expected to be a headwind for the year. Of course, it's a noncash item, and it doesn't really impact the underlying performance of the business. But it will impact the earnings for the year based on the trend that we're seeing right now. But I wouldn't say it's a reflection of a major change in what we're seeing in inflation.\n And obviously, we've shared before, when we see price increases, generally speaking, we'll be pushing back on them based on our knowledge of our own brand products and managing those. But where we are seeing them, we're generally looking to pass them on to the customer where it makes sense in those markets. \nRobert Ohmes: And just my other follow-up question. Just on fuel rewards, so you're expecting the CPG profitability of fuel kind of -- it sounds like flatten out next year. But it sounds like you're also going to be pushing harder, if I understood it, to kind of drive IDs more using the fuel rewards program. Just how should we think about that? And has there been a change in the responsiveness to fuel rewards that's got you interested in pulling that lever a little harder to drive IDs and penetrate loyalty more? \nW. McMullen: Yes. It really is an important part of our overall connection rewards on -- back to our customers for them shopping with us. I would say part of it is just continuing to learn new approaches that connect with the customer. So over the last, really, 6 to 12 months, we've been doing a lot of different types of tests and learns, trying to identify additional approaches that connect well with the customer. And it's really some of those are working, so we continue to scale that. How much we scale will really be driven by the degree of customer connection and how much does it drive the business. But customers still love an incredible great value for fuel. And we have so many convenient fuel locations. It really works out well for our customers and for our business as well. \nRobert Ohmes: And just, Rodney, how should we think about -- if you do keep growing it at 8% year-over-year, how will you fund that in 2020 if you're not going to be growing the profitability of your fuel business at the same rate? \nW. McMullen: Yes. Well, when we talk about fuel cents per gallon, we do not reduce that for any rewards at all. That doesn't show up there in terms of our internal financials. If you look at the overall guidance that we gave for 2020, we would be reflecting what we expect and plan to do on fuel rewards. But it really gets back to Gary's comment in terms of by -- improving identicals by this much, these type of process changes and getting costs out, what type of capacity does that give us to invest in service and price. And we would look at fuel rewards as part of that price investment because that's how our customers look at it.\n Thanks, Robbie. We really appreciate everybody joining us today. And as always, thank you for your questions. Hopefully, you can get the sense from Gary and my comments that our underlying business results continue to be strong. Identicals continue to move in the right direction. We had good balance on investing in growth and cost improvements, and the free cash flow of the business continued to be strong, which positions us to get into a position of being able to buy stock back as well. So when you look at it overall in the quarter, feel very good about the underlying results and where we're headed.\n As you know, before I end today's call, I always like to share a few final comments that's directed at our associates and how we live our purpose every day. Last week, I was visiting with store associates in our Collierville Kroger in Memphis. And a customer approached me when I was walking into the store, and he just wanted to share why he shops at Kroger. And he said -- first of all, I gave an example where one of our associates just gave incredible customer service. And then he said, \"Krogers, you always are great at donating food and funds to serve hungry families in our communities.\" And he specifically talked about his community. And to me, that reminded me of the privilege that we all have, to serve our customers and communities and each other, whether it's generously giving back to our neighbors in need or by being there for our more than 11 million customers that come into our stores and online every day, especially during this busy holiday season.\n We open our doors and welcome everyone in as guests, whether they shop with us all the time or it's their first time shopping with us. Each celebration or tradition is unique, and we can be there for our customers when they need us most. Because we believe no matter who you are, how you like to shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have affordable, easy-to-enjoy, fresh food. Each of us, all 460,000 associates, play an incredibly important role in bringing fresh for everyone to life. From stores to plants and distribution centers and our corporate and division teams, thank you for all you do every day and especially during this busy holiday season. I wish all of you and your friends and family happy holidays, merry Christmas and a happy new year. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2019 results is Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip.\n I would like to thank those of you who were able to attend our investor conference last month where we shared our progress on Restock Kroger. We believe that Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders. It provides us with a clear purpose and our vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. It focuses us on redefining the customer experience, identifying the partners who will help us deliver customer value today and in the future and putting the right talent and teams in place to focus on growth in our supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses.\n We are proud of the progress we have made, and we've learned from the challenges we've experienced. We are on track with a stable and growing supermarket business as a result of our customer obsession, renewed intensity around operational excellence and continued investment in seamless. We are growing our supermarket business by focusing on 3 levers to drive identical sales: fresh, power brands and data and personalization. And we continue to build a seamless ecosystem that is available, relevant and accessible for our customers. All of this combined to generate positive results in the third quarter.\n We continued to grow identical sales, reduce costs and deliver strong free cash flow. We had a broad-based identical sales improvement. 15 of our divisions had increasing supermarket identical sales without fuel compared to the second quarter. We delivered a slightly improved FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Headwinds in pharmacy were offset by strong fuel performance during the quarter. We are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth.\n Kroger continues to invest in digital as we build a seamless ecosystem for our customers. We know our customers value greater convenience this provides, and our data shows it's an essential component of growing overall loyalty. Digitally engaged customers not only drive growth through our digital modalities, they also help drive brick-and-mortar sales growth as well and share of wallet. So seamless is a both, not an either/or.\n Our data clearly shows that over time and after initial investments, the profitability of a digital customer is the same as an in-store customer. We continue to see an improving operating profit trend in digital, and therefore, our investments are maturing as expected and consistent with the graph we shared at Investor Day.\n Our digital sales grew 21% in the third quarter. As we shared previously, we expect our digital sales growth to moderate year-over-year primarily due to the cycling of Home Chef and as a result of our disciplined focus on growing the Ship customer. We have expanded our digital coverage to reach 96% of our customers. This means that 96% of our customers who shop Kroger in a brick-and-mortar store can also shop with us for pickup or delivery.\n We continue to invest in digital platforms as this is where the customers are increasingly going to meet many of their needs. Providing our customers with the ability to have anything, anytime, anywhere from Kroger sets us apart from a large segment of our competitors and will drive loyalty as well as our long-term growth and margin expansion.\n We continue the rollout of Ocado facilities. In November, Kroger announced plans for a new high-tech customer fulfillment center in Wisconsin. The automated warehouse will serve customers in Wisconsin, Northern Illinois and Northwest Indiana. What's so exciting about Ocado is their model to deliver to the customer is significantly less costly than our existing model and any of the other models we've examined as well. Not only will these facilities accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience, they will also help us to do it in a much more cost-effective way. We know Ocado's value is not just its current capabilities but also how quickly the company is able to innovate to serve a rapidly developing online consumer market. One of the comments we made at IR Day is that Ocado keeps learning and improving their model. Ocado's recent announcement of a micro fulfillment center in Bristol is a good example of this.\n We believe that the food industry is special. It is huge, a $1.5 trillion market. And not only do people need to eat, they love to eat. Food isn't a commodity, but it's the center of our lives. Customers deserve a partner like Kroger who can provide inspiration and fulfill their passion for food. And unlike our national competitors, Kroger is food first. We believe that no matter who you are, where you're from, how you shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have affordable, easy-to-enjoy fresh food that tastes amazing.\n As we shared in November, fresh is an important driver of sales for Kroger. Our fresh departments drive trips, loyalty and gross margin. Our product standards, selection criteria and supply chain are core strengths and are built to deliver first-to-market and best-of-season fresh products across the United States.\n Our produce department led the way in sales for the quarter, demonstrating how our store teams are focused on improving everyday execution in ways that are highly relevant to our customers. In addition, we launched our Fresh for Everyone brand transformation campaign, and the initial feedback from both our customers and our associates is very positive.\n One of the many ways we demonstrate our passion for food is through Kroger's best-in-class Our Brands portfolio. While many grocers offer private label products, Our Brands is a real differentiator for Kroger because our customers tell us through blind taste tests that Our Brands' quality is better than not only the competitors' private label products but also many leading national brands as well. Kroger's Our Brands grew 3.4% this quarter. We also introduced 231 new Our Brand items during the third quarter.\n Kroger's third differentiating lever to drive identical sales growth is personalization. Data is a differentiator for Kroger. Many retailers have transactional data, but none have the customer data and the insights to make meaningful suggestions to their customers like Kroger. We continue to see incredible effectiveness and efficiency from a focus on loyal customers and investing in their satisfaction.\n One specific area I'd like to highlight is our strong fuel points program. As we shared at the Investor Day conference last month, an amazing 83% of our loyal customers engage with our fuel rewards program each year. We are increasingly targeting promotion and personalization of fuel rewards, and fuel drove trips and sales in the third quarter.\n We are using the power of Kroger's stable and growing supermarket business to create meaningful incremental operating profit through the alternative profit stream businesses, which adds up to a business built for long-term growth that generates consistently attractive total shareholder returns.\n Kroger continues to generate strong and durable free cash flow as reflected by the fact that the company has reduced debt by $1.5 billion over the prior 4 quarters and continues to increase its dividend to create value for shareholders. We are confident that we can deliver even stronger TSR in the future because of our strong free cash flow and sustainable net earnings growth.\n Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders both today and the future.\n And now I will turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? Thanks, Gary. As I shared when we first began the call, we believe that Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business and create value for all of our stakeholders. We are on track with a stable and growing grocery business as a result of our customer obsession, renewed intensity around operational excellence and continued development of our seamless ecosystem. Our focus on the fundamentals generated positive results in our supermarket business in the third quarter, which gives us strong momentum heading into the holiday season.\n Now we look forward to your questions. Ed, this is Rodney. Just a couple of comments, and I'll let Gary fill in. Obviously, our identicals continue to improve and strong there. If you look at gross margin without fuel and pharmacy, a slight improvement there. We had great balance between cost improvements and gross investment and it's the continuation of those pieces coming together. So it's really -- the core business continuing to improve and move in the right direction, that's providing the tailwind to offset the $0.03 on the pharmacy that was out-of-a-quarter adjustment and the LIFO as well. I don't know, Gary, anything? It's a combination of really some technology investments that we've made in terms of how to buy fuel and making sure, from a market standpoint, how we're pricing on a daily basis and reacting to what our competitors are doing. So it's the benefit of the way fuel is being bought plus being much more disciplined relative to the market. So it's really the combination of those.\n In terms of expectations going forward, from a procurement standpoint, we don't believe that's something that will continue to incrementally get better. We do believe it's something that we'll be able to maintain, and it's something that we've reflected in our guidance going forward. Yes, it really gets back to Gary's comments in the prepared remarks is -- and we talked about at Investor Day, it's really reviewing our whole portfolio of things that we are involved with and working on. And it really -- the amount of investment that it would take for Lucky's to be a meaningful contributor to Kroger overall and the efforts that it would take, we just didn't think it created a good return for the investments that were needed to be made relative to that. So it was really driven by narrowing our focus and the additional requirements to make it something that would be meaningful to Kroger. I don't know, Gary, you've been more on a day-to-day basis involved, anything you want to add? Yes. Thanks, Chuck. If you look at quarter-to-date, our identicals would be pretty similar to where we were in the third quarter. The balancing of it is significantly different than the last few years because, obviously, there's 1 less week between Thanksgiving and Christmas. If you look at the way how customers spend their money, we continue to see obviously strong on people trading up, strong performance in wine, cheese, all those types of categories, and we would certainly expect that to continue to stay consistent through Christmas as well. So we really expect the business to continue where it is through Christmas. Obviously, if you look at January of next year, it's really the SNAP cycling, the SNAP impact would affect the kind of the numbers that we've provided for guidance. Yes. It's fascinating because the customer is trading up both in terms of buying bigger package size. So what we find is when people are tied on budgets, they go to smaller package size. So we see people trading up there. We see people trading up to products that's better for you, natural and organic category. Prepared foods would be an area that we see people continuing to trade up for, and it's an area where we've focused a lot of attention on how do we get better. We view it as a huge opportunity to improve from where we are. And it's one of those things where we're just at the beginning part of that journey but certainly see customers very willing to pick up dinner at Kroger but do it with a Home Chef meal or something already prepared. Yes. If you look at the outlook for the fourth quarter, so far in the quarter, we're tracking pretty similar to where we were in the third quarter. So it's really up until the SNAP period, we really don't see changes there.\n In terms of the pickup, free pickup option, we really aren't to a point yet of deciding whether to continue it or not. As you know, we've done it in several markets, and we're still early in the analysis. We -- the customer adoption has been stronger -- a little bit stronger than what we were expecting. But it's -- we're still at a point where we don't need to decide that yet in terms of whether we extend it or not. Yes. If you look at it on a run rate basis, the numbers that you shared would be very consistent with what we see. The other thing I always think is important to remember that I mentioned on our digital business and Yael shared it on a graph is the profitability of that business is maturing as we expect. And if you look at the early adopters on digital, the profitability of that customer was the same as going in store because we get such a higher share of their total spend. And we continue to see that maturity happen as well, which, for us, is something that makes it a sustainable model longer term as well. Yes. The -- I really would just go back to the comments that Gary made before. If you look at the underlying supermarket business, it continues to be strong. Identicals continue to be strong. A very good balance between cost reductions and investments in service and growth. The biggest swing would be the fuel margin. And even internally, the swings can be so much from day-to-day that it's really -- the value of where we are quarter-to-date, I don't think it can change overnight. And I remember the other day being in a market where in the morning, the margins were $0.40. In the afternoon, the margins were $0.15. It's that type of swing. But when you look at overall, it's a great return and it creates a lot of customer loyalty.\n So -- and then the other piece is SNAP. So I don't know, Gary, if there's any additional insight. But to me, quarter-to-date, fuel margins are just kind of hard because it swings so much. Yes. Just a couple of additions. Obviously, the overall economy continues to be strong as well, which provides support. And when you look at SNAP, we would be less dependent on SNAP than many of our competitors would be as well. Yes. The other thing that helped gross -- our shrink improved for the ninth consecutive quarter and warehousing and transportation costs improved as well. I'll start with the end of your question first. It doesn't affect us how we look at Home Chef at all. And if you think about our overall strategy on trying to serve the customer anything they want, anytime they want, anywhere they want, as you know, about half of food is food already prepared where people spend their money. And our market share there is significantly less than on the traditional supermarket business. And we really view that it will be a combination of Home Chef, something physical in stores in terms of meals ready to heat, ready to eat. And ClusterTruck is one of those where we think it's an addition to that overall ecosystem. Obviously, they have incredibly good technology. It's made to order quickly. And they will be able to leverage -- and we're doing -- it's obviously on a test basis, they'll be able to leverage some of our physical assets to be able to scale as well.\n So it's really an additional piece in terms of how do we get the customers what they want, when they want it, the way they want it. And it's just an overall part of the overall ecosystem. And we just see the opportunity on food that's already prepared is a massive opportunity. Yes. The -- great question, Michael. We would really view those as pretty equal. The other thing that we would add on top of that is really using personalization and data to be more specific for each customer individually. So like on -- the example I gave on fuel rewards, but it would be true for offers more than just fuel rewards, but really personalizing it to each household individually. And it's really all of those -- we would call it, the sum of all parts. It's all of that together that's creating and improving the momentum. It's not just one single thing. Yes. I'd only add a couple of things. One, and Gary briefly mentioned it, if you look at continuing to learn to improve the customer experience, that provides support and ongoing support because we still -- we've made good progress, but we still see opportunities to get better.\n The one area that I've been pleasantly surprised, as you know, we've been able to -- in 2018, we were able to take over $1 billion of costs out. We're on track to exceed that again incrementally in 2019, and we have plans to do that in 2020 as well. We continue to see good opportunity to take costs out. And when you look at all those -- both those pieces together and the free cash flow of the business is what gives us confidence and comfort in the comment that Gary shared at the investor meeting of TSR of 8% to 11% per year. Yes. One of the things that we always think it's important, we're comfortable where we are, but it's always important to remember that customers decide where to shop based on freshness of departments, and we shared with you that our customer feedback on fresh is better than our big box competitors. We also have tons of personalized offers where a customer gets value, both in terms of individual mailings, individual e-mails and fuel. So it's all of those pieces together, and we feel good about where we -- our gap is. Yes. It really is an important part of our overall connection rewards on -- back to our customers for them shopping with us. I would say part of it is just continuing to learn new approaches that connect with the customer. So over the last, really, 6 to 12 months, we've been doing a lot of different types of tests and learns, trying to identify additional approaches that connect well with the customer. And it's really some of those are working, so we continue to scale that. How much we scale will really be driven by the degree of customer connection and how much does it drive the business. But customers still love an incredible great value for fuel. And we have so many convenient fuel locations. It really works out well for our customers and for our business as well. Yes. Well, when we talk about fuel cents per gallon, we do not reduce that for any rewards at all. That doesn't show up there in terms of our internal financials. If you look at the overall guidance that we gave for 2020, we would be reflecting what we expect and plan to do on fuel rewards. But it really gets back to Gary's comment in terms of by -- improving identicals by this much, these type of process changes and getting costs out, what type of capacity does that give us to invest in service and price. And we would look at fuel rewards as part of that price investment because that's how our customers look at it.\n Thanks, Robbie. We really appreciate everybody joining us today. And as always, thank you for your questions. Hopefully, you can get the sense from Gary and my comments that our underlying business results continue to be strong. Identicals continue to move in the right direction. We had good balance on investing in growth and cost improvements, and the free cash flow of the business continued to be strong, which positions us to get into a position of being able to buy stock back as well. So when you look at it overall in the quarter, feel very good about the underlying results and where we're headed.\n As you know, before I end today's call, I always like to share a few final comments that's directed at our associates and how we live our purpose every day. Last week, I was visiting with store associates in our Collierville Kroger in Memphis. And a customer approached me when I was walking into the store, and he just wanted to share why he shops at Kroger. And he said -- first of all, I gave an example where one of our associates just gave incredible customer service. And then he said, \"Krogers, you always are great at donating food and funds to serve hungry families in our communities.\" And he specifically talked about his community. And to me, that reminded me of the privilege that we all have, to serve our customers and communities and each other, whether it's generously giving back to our neighbors in need or by being there for our more than 11 million customers that come into our stores and online every day, especially during this busy holiday season.\n We open our doors and welcome everyone in as guests, whether they shop with us all the time or it's their first time shopping with us. Each celebration or tradition is unique, and we can be there for our customers when they need us most. Because we believe no matter who you are, how you like to shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have affordable, easy-to-enjoy, fresh food. Each of us, all 460,000 associates, play an incredibly important role in bringing fresh for everyone to life. From stores to plants and distribution centers and our corporate and division teams, thank you for all you do every day and especially during this busy holiday season. I wish all of you and your friends and family happy holidays, merry Christmas and a happy new year."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. I want to echo Rodney and thank those of you who were able to attend or view the Investor Day webcast last month. As we shared in New York, our model for a strong and durable retail supermarket business begins with the customer and our obsession with increasing customer loyalty. We believe that our intensified focus on execution and continued improvements in the value and experience we deliver for our customers is driving increased identical sales across our store and digital ecosystem.\n To drive sustainable sales growth for the long term, we will continue to invest in areas of the business that are important to the customer. This includes ongoing investments in talent, price, digital and store experience, with an even greater emphasis on fresh, Our Brands and personalization. We are demonstrating through the first 3 quarters of the year we are being very deliberate in balancing these investments with disciplined execution of cost savings that simplify our business.\n Our supermarket business and the traffic and data this generates serves as the foundation from which we are able to drive higher growth in our asset-light, margin-rich alternative profit businesses that we continue to expect to accelerate our results. We expect our model to deliver improved operating results over time and continued strong free cash flow, and we expect this to translate into a consistently strong and attractive total shareholder return through EPS growth driven by sustained net earnings growth and the return of cash to shareholders via share repurchase, plus a growing dividend over time.\n Now I'd like to share third quarter results. For the quarter, we delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.47 per diluted share. As noted in this morning's press release, that includes a $0.03 out-of-period charge that I will share more detail on in a moment. But first, I'll highlight a few areas of our business that were particularly robust.\n Our Brands contributed as both a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the third quarter, and our fuel performance mitigated retail pharmacy gross margin headwinds in the quarter.\n LIFO charge for the quarter was $23 million compared to $12 million for the same period last year driven by inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. We now estimate LIFO for the year to be approximately $90 million versus our original expectation of $50 million.\n Our adjusted corporate tax rate for the quarter was 70 basis points higher than the same period last year due to a decrease in the benefits of federal tax credits and an increase in reserves.\n I'll now provide additional detail about 2 specific items that affected our results in the third quarter. First, the out-of-period charge of $29 million that I referenced earlier. This charge is related to a provision in a single pharmacy contract that should have been recognized over the previous 6 quarters. Given the complexity of the contract and the introduction of new clawback provisions, a part of the contract was misinterpreted. The required correction was identified in our standard management review process. This charge is not material to total company results, and the financial effect in each of the prior individual quarters was immaterial to net earnings per diluted share. However, the cumulative effect on our performance in the third quarter reduced adjusted net earnings per diluted share by $0.03 and gross margin by 9 basis points. We, therefore, felt it was important to provide a greater level of insight into this item. There is no effect on earnings guidance for 2019 or 2020 as a result of this contract going forward.\n I'd now like to talk about Lucky's Market. During our investor conference last month, we committed to continue to be disciplined in prioritizing capital allocation to improve return on invested capital and create sustainable shareholder return. As part of a portfolio review, we made the decision to evaluate strategic alternatives in relation to our investment in Lucky's Market. As a result of this review, the company has decided to divest its interest in Lucky's Market and recognized an impairment charge of $238 million in the third quarter. Accounting rules require Kroger to record the gross amount in operating profit. However, the real economic interest to Kroger is a pretax charge of $131 million. Additional details are provided in the financial tables of our press release.\n The impairment charge is a noncash charge and reflects the write-down of our initial investment in Lucky's Market as well as additional funding provided to operate and grow the business. There is no effect on earnings guidance for 2020 as a result of this decision.\n Turning now to some of the highlights in the third quarter as underlying trends were very robust. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 2.5% during the third quarter, marking our strongest quarter since we launched Restock program. Several supermarket departments outperformed the company, including produce, key beverage categories, pharmacy and natural foods. Digital contributed approximately 70 basis points to identical sales, with Kroger pickup and delivery continuing to show strong momentum.\n Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the third quarter was $653 million compared to $664 million in the third quarter of 2018. Gross margin was 22.1% of sales for the third quarter.\n FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 24 basis points from the same period last year primarily driven by industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and continued growth in our specialty pharmacy business.\n Gross margin rate, excluding fuel and pharmacy, improved slightly in the quarter as cost of goods savings and growth in alternative businesses offset continued retail price investments.\n While profitability in retail pharmacy is lower than we had budgeted this year, it remains an important part of our strategy and continues to generate good returns. We were pleased to see the decline in gross margin rate compared to last year was lower in the third quarter than the first 2 quarters of 2019, and this trend is expected to continue in quarter 4.\n As a result of continued growth in pharmacy sales, improved product sourcing and initiatives that lower the cost of fill trips, our expectation is that pharmacy profitability will be less of a headwind in 2020.\n Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the third quarter compared to last year. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement.\n OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 15 basis points. This was achieved through broad-based improvement of Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives.\n We remain on track to achieve over $1 billion of cost savings in 2019 on top of the $1 billion savings achieved last year. We also have clear line of sight to the $1 billion of incremental savings in 2020 that we shared at our investor conference. These savings are being achieved through improved productivity and automation, elimination of waste, improved sourcing of goods not for resale and administrative efficiencies.\n Like many industries, grocery retail is navigating through disruptive change. As part of the company's ongoing evolution, store operating divisions recently evaluated and reduced middle management roles to ensure they have the right talent in the right roles closest to our customers in store leadership positions. As a result, Kroger incurred severance charges in the third quarter totaling $80 million.\n Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, and our loyal customers continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards each year in the form of price discount at the pump. As Rodney mentioned, fuel is driving lower customer trips and sales, and the amount of fuel rewards paid to loyal customers increased by 8% in the third quarter.\n The average retail price of fuel was $2.62 this quarter versus $2.81 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the third quarter was $0.30 compared to $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger's sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the third quarter.\n Alternative profit streams are on track to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance continue to be the primary drivers of growth this year.\n Kroger Precision Marketing continues to build momentum, increasing engagement to over 1,000 brands with a 90% retention rate and significantly higher spend. We have relationships with all major agency holding companies supporting their media activations as they deploy brand-building programs. Our Media business continues to release new inventory and create new publisher relationships to support the demand of advertisers.\n And now to update on labor relations. As we have previously shared, we are proud that our average hourly rate is over $20 with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. As a result of Kroger's investments in our associates, we are improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development.\n We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Southern California, Portland, Seattle and Michigan during the quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas and Memphis. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant today to associates. \n Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\n A key element of our capital allocation strategy is to use our free cash flow to invest in the business and drive profitable growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals.\n We committed to prioritize free cash flow in 2019 to reduce the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to within our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Over the last 12 months, net total debt has reduced by $1.5 billion, and Kroger's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.5 for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2.72 a year ago. We remain committed to our target net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range.\n Now that we are operating within our target range, and as we expect to generate strong free cash flow, we anticipate starting to buy back shares in the fourth quarter under our $1 billion Board authorization. This is not expected to have a material impact on fourth quarter EPS.\n Turning now to guidance for 2019. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.25% in 2019. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019.\n We expect underlying identical sales growth in the fourth quarter will be similar to third quarter. However, incremental SNAP dollars that were in the market in January 2019 represent about a 50% -- 50 basis point -- excuse me, 50 basis point headwind in the quarter. We, therefore, anticipated reported ID sales will be towards the lower end of our 2019 guidance range for quarter 4 as we cycle the effect of SNAP.\n We continue to expect the fourth quarter to deliver double-digit EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Where we land with our adjusted EPS annual guidance range will be heavily influenced by fuel margins in the fourth quarter, which were at record highs in quarter 4 last year. Our customers' shopping behaviors affected by the lower SNAP dollars in market in January will also influence the outcome.\n As you know, we typically share annual guidance when we report our fourth quarter results in March. But this year, we provided guidance for 2020 several months early. We remain confident in the 2020 guidance that we shared last month at our Investor Day in New York.\n And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll cover that. So you're correct, we expect -- as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we are expecting adjusted EPS growth to be in the double digits in the fourth quarter. Obviously, as I mentioned a moment ago, we're assuming and expecting identical sales growth to be in the range in the quarter, continuing the sort of trend that we saw in Q3, but there will be some SNAP headwinds that will bring it down towards the lower end of the range. So that's the kind of core assumption around ID sales for the quarter.\n We do cycle some investments. In Q4 last year, if you recall that we set up costs around some facilities in D.C. So from a gross margin perspective, we do have some tailwinds that will help the quarter. We also expect to continue to see the cost-saving improvements that we've been accelerating throughout the year as we continue to execute on the $1 billion cost-saving plan. And of course, I think we shared on previous quarters that alternative profit streams tends to be skewed more towards the fourth quarter, predominantly because both KPS has a heavy fourth quarter influence on the results and then Media continues to accelerate, and Q4 is always a higher Media quarter as well. So you combine an accelerating rate and the fact that Media is higher in the fourth quarter helps the alternative profit part of the business to continue to grow.\n In terms of the sort of puts and takes in the quarter that could influence where we finish in the range, on the headwind side, obviously, we have been investing in a new brand launch, and we're obviously spending dollars there in continuing to improve the messaging and translating that into a connection with our customers. We also launched the promotion on free pickup for the quarter as well and seeing how that plays out in terms of customer behavior. And then, of course, we also have the fuel headwind in the fourth quarter where our rate was $0.34, which was a record high last year. So those would be the headwinds that we're pushing against versus the assumptions I mentioned earlier.\n The unknowns around the range, really, with fuel being a record high in the fourth quarter last year, if fuel performs in line with where it's been on average for the year-to-date position, it would obviously be at a certain level. If it was -- which is a $0.29 to $0.30 range, if it was at the similar level as last year at $0.34, that makes a meaningful difference to how the quarter ends. And then, of course, seeing how customers behave as a result of the SNAP dollars not being in market in January is a further factor in really causing us to leave the range as wide as it is. But we do feel confident in the way we see the model in the fourth quarter, which is why we still believe double-digit growth in the earnings per share is what we'd expect to achieve. I would completely agree with you, Rodney. I think the key thing for us is that, to your point, that those headwinds, even with those headwinds, if you strip those back in the quarter and look at Q3, underlying EPS and operating profit would have been positive excluding the out-of-period adjustment, as Rodney mentioned. Obviously, ID sales was very positive during the quarter. But we mentioned on the call, we didn't include it in the press release, but the impact of the out-of-period on gross margin rate was 9 basis points. So actually, in the quarter, gross margin rate, even with the pharmacy headwinds that we called out, would have been balanced with OG&A improvements over 15. So we were 24 basis points reported gross margin decline, excluding fuel. Taking out those 9 basis points, you get to the 15 basis points of underlying, if you like, gross margin investment after the -- excluding the onetime -- sorry, the out-of-period adjustment.\n So when we look at 15 basis points of investment, including pharmacy headwinds that we faced and we achieved 15 basis points of OG&A improvement, we actually feel like the progress that we're seeing in the model has been masked quite a bit in the quarter and we feel very positive about the underlying trends that we're seeing in the business. I don't -- I think you characterized it well, Rodney. I think the only thing maybe to build in the second part of the question, I -- we do believe that as we get better connecting on fresh and continue to evolve the strategy around natural and organic, obviously, we're providing a far more comprehensive level of experience for that customer than ever before and continue to do more of that as we continue to build out the strategy around freshness and connecting with our loyal customers.\n We do believe that there's still a role for the small format store. I think it's certainly proven. And I think it's still probably to be proven in the industry about what is the right model for a smaller format store and how do you make that economic model work and how do you connect with the customer in a way that drives the right value on those smaller shopping trips as well. So we still believe and continue to look for opportunities. And obviously, our Walgreens pilot continues to provide an opportunity to learn how to continue to build a strategy that has a small format presence in there. But I do think it also demonstrates your comment that it's hard to figure out that small format model and to make it work effectively. Just to add, Rodney, so it is literally a few weeks obviously into -- since we announced the promotion. It's interesting. We're seeing a combination of new customers starting to use the service as well as existing loyal Kroger shoppers using the service more frequently as well. So we'll be using all of that data, as you might expect, to really analyze and evaluate. And that's certainly a factor that could also influence how the quarter plays out in terms of sales, which is another reason why we're trying to be clear about sharing the different moving parts that could still affect the quarter. Just one thing to add, Rodney, you said in your prepared comments and I mentioned it briefly as well, but I think we shared before that it really is the cycling of the Home Chef merger that caused the absolute percentage growth rate to show a declining trend. The underlying progress that we're seeing in customer engagement through Kroger pickup and delivery continues to be very strong and very consistent in the underlying results that we're seeing beyond the headline number. We've cycled that now. So it kind of -- it was partly through Q3, so you have kind of roughly half of it in the -- sorry, partly through Q2, so roughly half of it in the second quarter, and now it's fully cycled through in Q3. I think Yael may have shared, too, at the investor conference that we expect the growth year-over-year going into 2020 to be in that 20% range, consistent with what we shared this quarter. Yes, I think that's right. And just to put the number into context, I mentioned it briefly earlier, but the rate that we've been trending at year-to-date in that $0.29-ish range, $0.34 was the Q4 rate last year. That $0.05 range can make a $50 million difference in terms of profitability. So -- and obviously, we have a very clear strategy of how we connect with customers on fuel and making sure that we're in line with the market. And so it is one of those areas where it can have a significant impact, and hence why I appreciate it does leave a much wider range than we normally want to, I think, have in place for the fourth quarter, and it's certainly not a lack of confidence in what we're seeing in the underlying core business, but it's just -- with that level of uncertainty out there on something like rates, it's -- we felt it was prudent to leave the range where it is. Yes. Thanks for the question. Ken, obviously, it's something that we continue to watch very closely. And obviously, it's one of those things that we knew was a potential risk that's out there in the business, and we'll continue to watch it and evaluate. From our perspective, we really try and build the business model around being able to adapt to the circumstances, and we do believe that the model that we're creating and our ability to connect with customers and deliver an overall experience, the personalized pricing offers that we can generate that obviously are -- what we tend to see when customers have less dollars, they'll tend to gravitate more to own brand products, and you'll start to see some behavior shift. But because food is a nondiscretionary spend, usually, the customer is going to make adaptations that they have to, to be able to still buy the groceries that feed the family.\n So from our perspective, it's certainly something that we contemplate as a risk as we think through how we'll continue to build our model and drive connection with customers. And it's something that we'll continue to adapt as we hear more and learn when and if the changes occur. But obviously, it's one of those things out of our control. And our focus is much more on how do we make sure we win the customer and continue to adapt strategy if some of those things were to hit us as a headwind in 2020. Yes. I don't think we've typically called out specifically price investments. What I would say in terms of maybe a couple of thoughts, when you think about gross margin and what happened in gross margin during the quarter, the way that -- to sort of break it down, if you like, and I covered a couple of these points earlier, but if you exclude fuel from the results, we had a 24 basis point investment in gross margin, 9 basis points of that related to the out-of-period charge that we shared in the press release this morning, which essentially brings it down to 15 basis points. All of that gross margin headwind was essentially in the health and wellness space between Kroger specialty pharmacy and retail pharmacy. And as Rodney mentioned, our gross margin rate overall improved slightly when you exclude pharmacy from the core business.\n So another way to say that is through the cost of goods savings that we were able to execute on during the quarter and the alternative profit growth that we were able to achieve during the quarter, which both support improvements in gross margin, we fully offset the continued price investments that we made in the business to drive the continued improvement in ID sales growth.\n We are continuing to invest in price. As we've shared, I think, at the Investor Day, a lot of our focus this year is on really making sure that we're using our data to drive the price investments in areas that matter most to our customers. And some of those are going to be personalized offers and promotions, but some of it will also be in fuel rewards. And we mentioned in the prepared comments that while the profitability of fuel improved during the quarter, that was offsetting the supermarket business by an 8% growth in the amount of fuel rewards that we paid to customers to incentivize them to continue buying Kroger.\n So it's a complex model in that sense, but we are continuing to invest in price. We're pleased with the way that customers are reacting to the investments that we're making because it's certainly allowing us as that one component of driving the identical sales growth that we shared in the quarter. But we're being very deliberate in balancing those investments with cost of goods savings and alternative profit growth. Thanks for the question. Just recall, again, it is really early days in the journey with the promotion because we literally launched it a few weeks ago. And obviously, part of the modeling that you would expect us to do as we understand customer behavior is to look at -- as Kroger does on everything that we do, look at the longitudinal behavior with the customer and not just the individual transaction but how does that change the level of engagement with the customer, and that's going to need to happen over a longer period of time, as Rodney mentioned earlier.\n Certainly, the early encouraging signs are, as I mentioned, we're starting to see new customers experience the service and start to engage in Kroger pickup that haven't before. We're also seeing existing Kroger pickup customers start to increase the frequency with which they use pickup service. And so a lot of the financial modeling that we will do will really be looking at those metrics over a longer period of time and saying, how does that play out in terms of the value it creates and how does it drive loyalty. And then, of course, as we talked a little bit about at the investor conference, we'll look at that in the context of the investments that we're making in the business and how does customer value this part of the experience versus other ways in which we're creating value across price investments, across fuel discounts and obviously through the experience that we're offering in the store.\n So it's a pretty complex area. And certainly, we'll look at it over a longer period of time. We're seeing kind of the type of behavior we have expected to see, and it's certainly been positive. But it's really going to be a longer period of time before we could really evaluate the way in which it impacts the model with the customer. We haven't really gotten into specifics around what our pricing strategy will be in 2020. As we talked about, obviously, I would think about it more much as you think back to the chart that I shared at the investor meeting in New York and how we're balancing the investments that we're making in the cost savings in the business. So we certainly have a clear view of how much we believe we want to invest in the business next year and how that will be supported by the $1 billion of cost savings that we're expecting. So if we were going to see the value in pickup driving more value in our model, it would be because either we expect it to drive higher sales and support the investment or we believe it would be a better way to invest the dollars that we think are important to driving value for the customer in 2020. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think on the first part of the question, I would kind of draw back again to what we talked about at the investor conference. The way we think about the model going forward is, certainly, we're going to continue to invest in price. We're going to continue to invest in the customer experience because the long-term sustainable growth in loyalty, we think that's critical to our plan. What we're doing very deliberately is being very disciplined in how we're managing costs within the business, both cost of goods savings but also OG&A cost efficiency, which obviously was strong during the quarter. And then alternative profit streams continues to accelerate and obviously offset the gross margin investments that we're making as well.\n So I think we look at it much more of an overall ecosystem, if you like, is how do we use food as the foundation for customer loyalty, which drives the traffic. And then fuel obviously builds on that in terms of causing customers to shop more frequently. And then you think about the health and wellness business and alternative profit streams layering on together to create this overall ecosystem that drives customer loyalty and drives total profitability of the customer. And the way we think about it is how do we pull those levers together in a way that allows us to continue to invest and build loyalty. And we're using the different dynamics there around alternative profit and cost savings to be able to continue to invest.\n I think when we look at the market, certainly, obviously, there's always high competition. We expect that to continue. We always assume that within our model. And we feel very good about the plans that we're implementing around driving costs out and continue to grow alternative profit that we can make the investments that we need to, to be able to continue to grow customer loyalty. Sure. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes, it's an interesting question around LIFO and inflation because -- I'll maybe answer the 2 questions slightly differently. From an inflation point of view, as you know, we've shared before, we were assuming inflation in the range of 0% to 1% in the year. I would say it's trending slightly above that range. Actually, for Q3, I wouldn't say it's materially different than it was in Q2. There are a couple of categories like produce went slightly down and meat went slightly up, but nothing that would have been dramatic in terms of the overall change in inflation. So just slightly ahead of that 1% assumption that we had during the year. And actually, even though our LIFO charge forecasted increasing, we haven't really seen a dramatic change in the overall inflation rate across the categories. Everything I just said now I should probably caveat excludes fuel and pharmacy because those 2 obviously tend to have a different trajectory versus most of the food categories.\n Interesting -- with LIFO, it is a one data point in time at the end of the year that we follow to support the accounting rules that are in place around making that LIFO adjustment. With the data point that we used in the third quarter caused us to, in following that process, believe that we should increase the rate and based on what it's telling us, that's why we called out the forecast is expected to be a headwind for the year. Of course, it's a noncash item, and it doesn't really impact the underlying performance of the business. But it will impact the earnings for the year based on the trend that we're seeing right now. But I wouldn't say it's a reflection of a major change in what we're seeing in inflation.\n And obviously, we've shared before, when we see price increases, generally speaking, we'll be pushing back on them based on our knowledge of our own brand products and managing those. But where we are seeing them, we're generally looking to pass them on to the customer where it makes sense in those markets."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.\n Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]\n In addition, please save the date for our 2019 investor conference, which will be held in New York City on November 5. Further details will be shared soon, and we hope you can join us.\n I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's second quarter 2019 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.\n Kroger is focused on executing the second year of our Restock Kroger plan to generate shareholder value by serving America through food inspiration and uplift. Restock Kroger has 4 main drivers: redefine the grocery customer experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Combined, these drivers come together to create shareholder value.\n We are halfway through the second year of our 3-year plan. We continue making strategic investments to reposition the company for the future while continuing to grow and deliver today. We started this conversation the last 2 quarters by acknowledging we had our work cut out for us. As always, we remain energized by that challenge. While we're always continually driving for improvement, there are several examples in our second quarter results that reflect the disciplined focus of Restock Kroger blueprint is paying off.\n Guided by our customer obsession, Kroger delivered our best identical sales results since the launch of our transformational plan. Our internal customer measures are improving even faster than our identical sales growth. There is always a lag between improving the customer experience and when the customer will reward us. Some other positive trends during the second quarter include FIFO operating margin that was stable in our supermarket business, excluding fuel and pharmacy. 15 of our divisions had increasingly -- increasing supermarket identical sales without fuel compared to the first quarter.\n We continue to reduce costs. We are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth.\n We continue to make significant investments to redefine the grocery customer experience. We are building a platform of seamless experiences to serve customers anything they want, anytime they want, anywhere they want. We know the seamless experience is essential to the customer experience, both today and tomorrow, which is why we continue to invest heavily in our capabilities in this area.\n Kroger's digital sales grew by a solid 31% in the second quarter. Pickup and delivery sales growth continued to perform in the mid-30% during the quarter. Going forward, we expect our digital sales growth rate to moderate year-over-year primarily due to the cycling of Home Chef and as a result of our disciplined focus on growing the Ship customer of our other digital offerings like Vitacost. Vitacost remains an important part of our business, and our growth in Ship is in part thanks to what we've gained from their platform and talent.\n We've also expanded our digital coverage area to reach 95% of our customers. This means that 95% of our customers who shop Kroger at a brick-and-mortar store can also shop with us for pickup or delivery. Importantly, we are starting to see improving operating profit trends in our digital business. Our digital business is becoming less of a headwind, which is an important inflection point, and we continue to invest in new capabilities to support our transition to seamless. However, I do want to note, this is still a significant investment for the company.\n A great example of partnering for customer value is our continued rollout of Ocado sheds. In July, Kroger and Ocado announced plans for a new high-tech customer fulfillment center in Forest Park, Georgia. What's so exciting about Ocado is that their model to deliver to customers is significantly less costly than our existing model. So not only will sheds accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience, they will also help us to do it in a much more cost-effective way.\n We know Ocado's value is not just its current capabilities but also in how quickly the company is able to innovate to serve a rapidly developing online consumer market. Ocado's technology team of over 1,400 software engineers brings a huge depth of talent and a long track record of innovation to growing opportunities in online grocery retail.\n We also announced an expansion of our relationship with Walgreens to a new test area in Knoxville, Tennessee. Starting this fall, 35 Walgreens stores in the area will feature a curated selection of Kroger's popular Our Brands products like Simple Truth, America's largest natural organic brand, along with national brand products.\n Kroger's Our Brand sales grew 3.1% this quarter. Retail and unit share growth led to the highest second quarter share in Our Brands' history. We also introduced 203 new Our Brand items during the second quarter. Our customers' favorite new items near key food and flavor trends we predicted and then shared with our investor community last year at Investor Day. And those new items delivered more than $137 million in incremental sales during the second quarter, further bolstering our supermarket business. We were thrilled to share the news last week that Kroger is leading the way with the widest assortment of plant-based protein among U.S. retailers through our Simple Truth brand.\n We continue to see progress in alternative profit streams with Media and Kroger Personal Finance as the primary growth drivers. Gary will share additional commentary on the progress of our alternative profit streams in his section.\n Now moving to talent development. As we previously shared, we are proud that our average hourly rate is over $20 per hour with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. As a result of Kroger's talent development investments, we are significantly improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger by supporting associates in a variety of ways, including investment in wages, training and development.\n Feed Your Future is our industry-leading education assistance program continues to build momentum. Among all the participants, more than 85% are hourly store associates. Since inception of the program last year, we've distributed 3,000 awards totaling $5.1 million in education assistance.\n In addition to continuing to develop talent internally, we continue to recruit talent from the outside, especially in the areas of digital, technology and supermarkets. Increasingly, customers, associates, stakeholders and U.S. investors are choosing who to partner with based on a purpose and values. We were pleased to see the business roundtable's recent announcement, acknowledging that businesses have a responsibility to be a positive influence on society. Kroger has always been focused on being a trusted partner in communities and committed to social purpose.\n In the second quarter, we were proud to publish our 2019 environmental, social and governance report, reflecting our efforts across the company to be environmentally responsible and a positive influence on society. The report detailed progress on Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan as well as our 2020 sustainability goals.\n Other items highlighted in the report included our 9% reduction in food waste generated by retail stores. We achieved a 13% improvement in supermarket food waste diverted from landfills, moving from 27% diversion in 2017 to 40% in 2018. We reduced the amount of plastic resin in Our Brands packaging by 9.1 million pounds so far, well on our way to achieving our 10 million pound goal by 2020.\n I will now turn it over to Gary for more detail into our quarterly financials. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver for shareholders while we reposition the company for the future through Restock Kroger. For the quarter, we delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.44 per diluted share. I'd like to highlight a few areas on our business that were particularly robust.\n Our Brands contributed as both a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the second quarter and delivered on our Restock Kroger savings plans. The alternative profit businesses achieved budget, setting us up to deliver our incremental operating profit target for 2019. And our fuel performance was strong, helping mitigate pharmacy gross margin, LIFO and tax headwinds in the quarter. \n LIFO charge for the quarter was $30 million compared to $12 million for the same period last year driven by a higher-than-expected inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. Our adjusted corporate tax rate for the quarter was 23.9% compared to 18% in the same period last year. These 2 factors combined represented a $0.05 per diluted share headwind in the quarter compared to last year.\n As Rodney mentioned, Kroger reported identical sales without fuel at 2.2% during the second quarter, marking our strongest quarter since we launched our transformation plan. Several departments outperformed the company in the quarter, including key beverage categories, produce and natural foods. We were also pleased with top line momentum in our pharmacy business and experienced mid-single-digit increase in script counts. Overall, we are pleased with sales progress in the quarter, and we will continue to work to build on this momentum in the second half of the year.\n Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the second quarter was $626 million, an increase of 10.6% compared to the second quarter in 2018. Gross margin was 21.9% of sales for the second quarter. FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 29 basis points from the same period last year primarily driven by industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and continued growth in our specialty pharmacy business. Retail supermarkets, excluding fuel and retail pharmacy, saw 12 basis points of gross margin investment.\n Based on the needs of the business, we are focused on balancing margin investments and capturing cost of goods, sourcing savings and operational efficiencies to offset these investments. As a great example of this focus, our associates have done an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the second quarter compared to last year. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement.\n OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 14 basis points. This was achieved through continued focus on execution of Restock Kroger initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, store productivity and sourcing cost reductions.\n We always look for opportunities to improve free cash flow and ROIC, important metrics to Kroger shareholders. During the quarter, we accepted a substantial offer to sell an unused warehouse that had been on the market for some time. Kroger used the gain from this transaction as an opportunity to contribute a similar amount into the UFCW company pension plan, helping stabilize associates' future benefits. The net impact of these transactions to EPS growth was neutral.\n As we have previously shared, fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, and our loyal customers continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards each year in the form of price discounts at the pump. The average retail price of fuel was $2.71 this quarter compared with $2.85 in the same quarter last year. Retail fuel profit came in above our expectations for the quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the second quarter was $0.35 compared to $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the second quarter. We now expect fuel to be less of a headwind in the second half of the year than originally anticipated.\n Alternative profit streams are on track to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance will be the primary drivers of growth this year.\n Kroger Precision Marketing continued to build momentum in the quarter, increasing engagement to over 300 consumer packaged goods companies and experienced a 90% retention rate along with significantly higher spend. Kroger Personal Finance also saw growth in line with expectations during the quarter as we successfully expanded the number of customers and the frequency with which customers utilize these products.\n And now for an update on labor relations. We ratified the new labor agreement with the UFCW covering associates in Fort Wayne, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; and Nashville, Tennessee, during the second quarter. We also reached a tentative agreement with the UFCW covering 17,000 associates in our Ralphs division in Southern California earlier this week. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland and Seattle. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.\n Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\n Our financial strategy is to use our strong free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. We committed to prioritize free cash flow to reduce the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to within our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Over the last 12 months, net total debt has reduced by $1.3 billion, and Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.46 for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2.59 a year ago. We remain committed to our target net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range, and as we start to operate consistently within that range, we will explore options for returning additional capital to shareholders. Earlier this year, Kroger increased the dividend by 14%, marking the 13th consecutive year of dividend increases.\n Turning now to guidance for 2019. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.25% in 2019. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. We are pleased with our second quarter progress and are maintaining full year guidance to 2019.\n With pharmacy gross headwinds expected to continue in the second half of 2019 and as we lap a particularly strong OG&A performance in the third quarter of 2019 -- 2018, we now expect EPS to be flat in the third quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter, we expect double-digit EPS growth as we lap discrete items from prior year and continue to build strong momentum with our alternative profit streams.\n I'll now turn it back to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. As Rebekah said earlier, our Annual Kroger Investor Day is coming up in New York on November 5.\n As Gary just mentioned, we reconfirmed our 2019 guidance for identical sales, excluding fuel, adjusted EPS and adjusted FIFO operating profit as well as reconfirmed that we are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth. We want to be clear on today's call that we are not reconfirming the 3-year $400 million in incremental operating profit expectation. In November, we will give detailed 2020 annual guidance. I do want to highlight that we do expect to deliver FIFO operating profit growth in 2020 over 2019 confirmed guidance. We have outlined a handful of key goals for our Investor Day and would like to use this opportunity to provide you with a preview.\n At Investor Day, we plan to reinforce our commitment to the overall framework of our Restock Kroger transformation plan, sharing what has worked well and what has not worked well thus far. We intend to do a deep dive into our supermarket business, which underpins the redefining grocery customer experience pillar of Restock Kroger. November 5 is the appropriate forum to be deliberate and to allow the experts on our team to spend the proper amount of time with our financial stakeholders to explain how we are thinking about Kroger's business model and how to measure the shareholder value created by Restock Kroger. Several of our senior executives will give detailed updates on our progress against the key metrics in our supermarket business and our momentum as well as how we think about it going forward. We will reiterate the ongoing successful results behind our asset-light, margin-rich alternative profit businesses. We will also talk about the continued strength in free cash flow since the announcement of Restock Kroger, which enabled us to get back to within our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range earlier than expected. In addition, we will share our views on the business as we look further out beyond 2020 where growth is expected to continue.\n I've said it many times before. Transformation is incredibly difficult, and that's the journey we are on with Restock Kroger. As we reflect on this journey, we want to be transparent about what went according to plan and what didn't go as anticipated. Some things are coming to fruition as we expected but just later than we thought such as identical sales momentum. Some things were unanticipated such as the lower gross profit margin in the pharmacy business that the entire industry is experiencing. Things we did expect and that are going even better than we thought include productivity improvements and cost savings.\n Over the course of the 3-year plan and today's retail environment, there are lots of puts and takes. That said, I want to reiterate that Kroger is committed to FIFO operating profit growth in 2020 over 2019 confirmed guidance.\n The Restock Kroger transformation journey sets the company up for long-term growth looking forward. And the benefits we have seen thus far have helped Kroger in our transformation from grocer to growth company. We have the right overall strategy and framework for this business and look forward to telling you more about it in November.\n Now Gary and I will take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: Congrats on a good quarter. So first, I guess on the comp acceleration, I was curious if you can give some more color in terms of whether you saw improvement in traffic or ticket. And also, what do you believe contributed to the comp acceleration during the quarter? \nW. McMullen: Yes. As I mentioned in the call, in the prepared remarks, it was broad-based across most divisions. The area that we saw the biggest year-on-year improvement is average spend per item. Customers continue to go upscale and buy bigger product sizes. We also saw continued improvement in loyal households in terms of the numbers and the frequency of their visits. The other pieces to me that I was especially proud of our team is it's broad-based and it's really using our data to connect with customers one on one. \nGary Millerchip: Rodney, maybe if I could just add a couple of things. I think what we're seeing, as Rodney mentioned in prepared comments too, is many of the elements that we shared in the early part of the year around the accelerators that we expected to help improve the trend in ID sales as we headed through the year have certainly started to show through in the metrics that we look at. So as you'll recall, we talked about as we start to lap the heavier price investments from last year and the space optimization changes that we made in -- predominantly in Q2 and early Q3 last year, as Rodney mentioned, is we're seeing the customer metrics that we look at internally and continue to execute better on starting to show through a trend and improving sales performance.\n And while we -- as we shared on the call and in the press release, the absolute digital sales growth was a lower rate. That was really an adjustment for the Home Chef purchase a year ago. And when you look at ClickList and home delivery, they are still performing very consistently and driving significant growth. And I think we see all those components continuing to build and certainly in a way that we look to the year and expected Q2 and Q3 and beyond to play out. We're seeing a lot of those elements that we expected starting to show through in the results. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And a quick follow-up question. Any color you can provide in quarter-to-date trends? \nW. McMullen: If you look at quarter-to-date, obviously, a year ago, there was a hurricane that affected a couple of our divisions in a meaningful way. And we're in the middle of that happening a year ago. If you exclude those 2 divisions, we would be slightly ahead of where we were in quarter 2, but it's just slightly. And we -- I've excluded those 2 divisions just because until we get through the total cycling, it's really hard to say exactly where we'll be. But continued progress. \nOperator: The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: So Rodney, curious, your take on the pharmacy business, right, where it sits today. Obviously, it looks like a fair bit of pressure on EBIT margin. How transitory do you think that is? And when you think about that business long term, I know you've always wanted to kind of own that customer because of the loyalty factor. Do you think about ways to do something with that business, right, to alleviate the pressure on the P&L? \nW. McMullen: The -- one, the one point you made, I think, is incredibly important. If you look at the pharmacy customer, that customer is incredibly loyal to Kroger. And when you look at their total spend, it's a fantastic customer to have. When you look at the pharmacy business overall, it continues to be very, very profitable relative to the assets invested. And obviously, year-on-year, there's headwind. But when you look at the total business, it still continues to be a strong business.\n The other thing is our pharmacy team has done an incredible job on -- to identifying opportunities to build the business, which obviously get a flow-through benefit of that, and significant operating changes to take costs out of the business. Now taking costs out of the business mitigated a meaningful part of the gross pressure, but still, there is more things to be done on taking costs out and process changes. So when you look at the business overall, I'm incredibly excited about the progress we're making. But looking forward, I think it's still a critical and important component of our overall business strategy. \nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. And then secondly, when you think about the Ocado rollout, right, one, much pressure on 2020. I know they won't open until '21 and probably a little pressure on '20. But then secondly, do you yet have sort of an ideal budget for the Ocado progression, right? From day 1 it opens, the shed is unprofitable by some amount and the time to profitability is x number of months or quarters. I know it's theoretical, but have you been able to get your arms around that? \nW. McMullen: Well, I would say we have an estimate on expectations on that, and it would be different depending on whether it's in existing market or a new market. And if you look at our budget expectations in a new market, it would take longer for ramp to profitability versus an existing market where you can move volume over on day 1.\n The modeling that we've done is really using the experience Ocado has had in their ramp-ups in England and adjusting it for traffic patterns in the U.S. locations of our stores, location of customers and labor rates and those types of things. Obviously, until you get a facility open, you don't know whether all of those assumptions are correct. We would typically expect a facility to be somewhere year 2 to year 3 before it gets to profitability. But that is -- time will tell but the best of our estimates and best of the experience that Ocado has had.\n The other thing that we're hoping is if you look at each facility Ocado has opened, it keeps -- it gets better on a ramp-up than the prior one. And one of the nice things is that Ocado will open up a facility in Canada that we'll be able to learn from as well plus the learnings they've had. And that's the one piece that we haven't included in the budget is the fact that they keep getting better. \nGary Millerchip: And the other piece to mention and you referred to it in your opening comments as well, we're learning a lot more as we continue to see as customers evolve digitally, engaging with us. And so we have a clear model in our mind of what our expectations are, but that model continues to evolve as we learn how customer behavior changes between delivery to home, between pickup at the store and really making sure that we're optimizing the efficiency and the innovation from Ocado to really support the whole digital ecosystem. And I think that's going to continue -- gets more exciting as we think about how the way the customer is changing and how Ocado can meet those needs in the future as well. \nW. McMullen: Yes. And Gary just implied and I talked about it in the prepared remarks, Ocado is significantly more efficient than the way we're doing it today. \nOperator: The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: So Rodney, I wanted to ask you about 2020. And I know you talked about -- that you're thinking you'll grow FIFO operating profit. You didn't want to give a lot more detail, but I was hoping that you can provide some additional color around the key drivers to that. And then I also wanted to ask, because you've pulled guidance now, which is okay because no one thought you were going to get there. But you've also introduced uncertainty to investors because we don't know what you're thinking. Is there some minimum expectation that you could at least speak to today to help us out in terms of how you're thinking about 2020 and where this business is going? \nW. McMullen: Yes. A couple of comments. And as you mentioned, we'll get to a whole lot more detail in November on all the pieces, and we'll also talk about 2020 and beyond. If you look at the key drivers, it would continue to be identical sales growth. Obviously, managing our gross profit margin. We continue to find a lot of cost opportunities, everything from process changes to cost of goods to goods not for resale. And in fact, one of the things that we're identifying there is there's a longer stream of opportunities than what we had even originally expected as part of Restock Kroger.\n On the guidance for 2020, that was the reason that I made the comment that we did want to be clear that we expect 2020 operating profit dollars to grow over 2019 provided guidance, just to make sure that people understood that we do expect a growth. We're in the middle of the process, and it's a process normally we wouldn't finish until March of next year when we would give this next year guidance. We are accelerating it until November because we think it's incredibly important to do that, but we are in the process on specifics. But we did want to make sure that everybody understood that we do expect growth. \nEdward Kelly: All right. So just follow-ups on this. So from a gross margin standpoint, your gross margin ex fuel, pharmacy kind of flattening out. Can we expect that to continue over time? And then secondly, at your leverage target, historically, you've been very good about returning cash to shareholders, particularly through share buyback when your stock is perceived to be undervalued. Could that be a larger portion -- or could that be a larger initiative next year? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks for the follow-up questions. This is Gary. I'll take them in the order that you asked the questions. So on gross margins, certainly, we do continue to invest in price. And as Rodney mentioned, there are significant offsets in the investments that we're making in the way that we're managing cost of goods in the team. And over time, we expect, as we've shared, as we reclassified alternative profit, that will also become a tailwind that offsets investments and helps gross margin as well. So while we certainly believe that price investments are sort of critical part of the strategy, we do expect it to look different from what you would have seen in 2018 and 2017 in terms of a level of investment when you look at the time that we have for 2019 and the rest of the year.\n As you know, we use our data and insights, too, to really understand what's important for the customer. And we're continuing to make sure we're priced right on the products that matter most to the customer, both from everyday pricing and from the way we personalize the offers through using the data that we uniquely have available to us because 96% of data is tethered to a loyalty card. But we also know from customer insights that it's not just about price, and ultimately, our customers decide to shop at Kroger because certainly of value but then also the quality of the products, the personalization that we can offer through our data and the freshness and the experience. And so we do feel good around the plan for the rest of the year as we head into 2020 around how we'll manage those levers.\n From a free cash flow perspective, to the second part of your question, I'll really just maybe reinforce a couple of comments that we made in the prepared remarks that you should certainly expect Kroger to be -- continue to be focusing on how do we maximize free cash flow for the value of our shareholders. We are now about within the range. It's important to us that we demonstrate we are consistently back in the range because there can be some volatility in a retail business, and we want to make sure that we've delivered on our commitment to operate within the range. But certainly now that we're there and we expect to continue to generate free cash flow, we will be looking very closely at what's the most effective way to return capital to shareholders. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: It's also a follow-up on 2020. You mentioned that your cost takeouts and your productivity initiatives are doing better than what you previously expected. But obviously, for you to back off some of your prior target, there are things that are not going as well as you anticipated. So can you give us more detail whether it's your ID sales growth, the market being tougher than you expected, the alternative profit stream. On each of those different levers, can you give us more detail on what's not going as well as you expected? \nW. McMullen: Sure. Yes. A couple of those tie back to what we talked about before. But the pharmacy, obviously, is at a different level than what we expected when we did the original expectations just in terms of market structural changes that's happened to everybody in the industry. Obviously, identical sales made progress -- are making progress, but it's taking us longer than what we expected. If you look at alternative profit, it continues to be ahead of what we expected and continues to grow strongly. And in November, we will give more details on all of those. And productivity and process changes and cost opportunities, we continue to see a big pipeline for those and even more than what we originally expected. And just to remind everybody, we're taking over $1 billion a year of costs out to operate the company. \nMichael Lasser: And my follow-up, Rodney, is when you put together this plan, you had some assumption about the competitive landscape, both from bricks-and-mortar players as well as the emerging digital threat. How is the overall market environment relative to where you thought it was going to be? Is it -- presumably given that you're backing off some of these targets, it's probably a little tougher than you anticipated. Is that fair? \nW. McMullen: No. I would -- when you look at the competitive environment overall, I would say it's pretty similar to what we thought at the time. The pharmacy would be the exclusion to that, that I mentioned. But when you look at new operators in the market, we assumed that it would continue to be important. We've been proactive, especially since we merged with Harris Teeter, making sure that we created seamless experience and have a strong digital offering. And I always tell everybody, job one is to make sure we don't lose the customer; job two is we'll figure out how to make it profitable. And we're indifferent whether somebody shops digitally with us or in a store. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this quarter, we actually saw that headwind was less in the second quarter year-on-year from a digital standpoint.\n So when you look at overall, I would say, we would say pretty much what we expected. Pharmacy is a little different. And we knew that there would be a transition period that we needed to transform the company, which is what drove us behind the Restock Kroger commitments. \nOperator: The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nJudah Frommer: Maybe just a couple more follow-ups. I think like Ed said, it's not a big surprise that the guides pulled. Can you clarify if it's just the operating profit piece that's pulled? Is the free cash flow guide still intact? Or is everything gone? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks for the question. So as Rodney mentioned, we really plan to give you far more detail in November. And we felt it was really important that we committed to doing that in 6 or 7 weeks from now to be able to provide all the color. We still have obviously huge confidence in the level of free cash flow that we're generating within the company and continues to be a strength in this year. I do think we would want to provide additional guidance on that alongside, as Rodney mentioned, our future financial strategy and how we create value for shareholders at the November meeting. \nJudah Frommer: Okay. That certainly makes sense. And kind of in terms of what hasn't gone right versus what has, I would imagine that this quarter gives you more confidence in kind of the go-forward process. ID is above 2%, gross margin ex fuel and the pharmacy down in the low double-digit range. Is part of the, I would say, pulling or pushing out operating profit dollar growth to perhaps beyond 2020, is part of that getting back to a more normalized supermarket operating environment and delivery of supermarket operating income growth? And can we expect that kind of this quarter and the guidance for the next couple quarters is indicative of what you think a normalized level is? \nW. McMullen: We'll get into more details in November. But a couple of comments I would add to your comments, and I mentioned it in the first quarter earnings call. If you look at the things that we measure internally in terms of how -- the feedback customers give us on what kind of experience we're giving them, what we find is that there's always a lag behind identical sales and when the customer tells us we're doing a better job. And when you look at the second quarter, we certainly felt like that was a reflection of that and we continue to improve the experience. To get into a lot more details on it, I really think we're probably better off to where we have a lot of time in November where we can go line by line. But I do think it was important for everybody to understand we do expect 2020 to have operating profit growth over the '19 confirmed commitment. \nJudah Frommer: Okay. If I can just squeeze one follow-up. Is there a way you can address maybe market share in the quarter relative to your market share trends over the last few -- I mean 2.2% is certainly well above kind of industry scanner data. \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at market share overall, we would say basically it's flat. It's within -- it's probably up or down as mentioned, but I would say we're not satisfied, but it's moving in the right direction. \nOperator: The next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nRobert Ohmes: Actually, 2 questions. Rodney or Gary, the continued rollout of delivery and pickup, can you give us some help thinking about the shape of that impacting your EBITDA margin? Is it -- do you get to a point later this year or next year where you start to anniversary pressures and you see alleviation from the pressures of that rollout? Any kind of help on that would be great. And second, I just want to follow up on the dry grocery inflation commentary. Is that something that's building momentum? Is that CPG company pressure? Is that something that is a tailwind for IDs in the back half and maybe into next year? That would be helpful as well. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Robby. \nGary Millerchip: So on digital, first of all, we are certainly -- continue to be very excited around what we see in the way that customers engage with us differently as they start to become more of a -- Rodney referred to as a seamless customer where we're delivering for the customer both, whether it's delivery to home or ship to home. And everything we see about the way that customer engages more deeply with us shows the value of that overall relationship across all the channels of store and digital working together. I know we've shared before that when we look at spend lift, we see a significant spend lift from the customer when they fill that first basket, it's a much higher basket and a significant part of that spend is incremental. And then over time, we also see customers actually move to a position where their visits in the store actually increase as well as they overall build their loyalty with us.\n And so you're right, Robby, it's very much a maturation curve, if you like. And so we monitor every store and every vintage of the business that goes through that maturation of launching pickup and launching delivery to home. And what we see is that, that curve where by about year 2, year 3 of the customer engagement in those stores, we start to become really agnostic around how the customer is shopping with us because of the incrementality that we see overall in that behavior and how that mold to Kroger.\n So as they're starting to come through that maturity curve, that's really what Rodney was referring to when he mentioned that we start to see digital less of a financial headwind in the Q2 this year and then into the second half of this year because we're really starting to see the maturation of that business, partly the customer behavior obviously accelerating, but also because we don't have the same start-up costs and the same investments in launching those services.\n So we certainly expect that to continue, and we are very focused on how do we maintain and accelerate the growth of customer engagement through digital. We were pleased that we have continuation of digital household engagement growing again during the quarter, and that's very much a focus for us. As we continue to grow their loyalty and we get past that maturation point, as Rodney said, it's still an investment overall for the business. So where we get even more excited when you think about the technology with Ocado and the opportunity to automate some of the back-end operation, if you like, providing those services because that has the potential to significantly shorten the path to profitability as well when you think about the way the customer shops with us seamlessly overall. \nRobert Ohmes: So would you say, Gary, that the peak EBITDA margin pressure from the rollout of pickup and delivery has been passed and we just passed it this quarter? \nGary Millerchip: That's essentially what we're seeing overall within the way we look at our digital business and the way you look at that customer maturation. That's right. But that's kind of what Rodney was referring to. \nW. McMullen: And Gary -- I agree with Gary's point, and we also continue to invest in Ship and some of the other components as well. That is a high start-up cost, but that's even reflected in the numbers that Gary talked about. \nRobert Ohmes: Great. And then just on the inflation outlook for dry grocery and what's driving that. \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Obviously, we deal with the question of CPG partners addressing price increases all the time. It's something that we deal with on a case-by-case basis, and we feel we're in a particularly strong position to really understand what's happening there because of our own brand products and the way in which we can have those conversations to make sure that the price increases are legitimate cost increases coming through to us. Certainly, as we shared, we are seeing our range for the year on inflation which we were assuming it would be somewhere between 0 to 1% and what we're actually seeing in a couple of those categories that I mentioned in the prepared comments that we're slightly ahead of that range. We continue to obviously manage to try and mitigate those through cost of goods opportunities and certainly where we do see the price increases coming through. And we believe they're legitimate, we are looking to pass them on to customers where it makes sense in light of the competitive environment. \nW. McMullen: The other thing, Gary, just one addition that I think is always important to remind and we always remind our CPG partners, if they're raising costs more than the market is going up, our own brands always gains share. And it's incredible, strong quality product obviously. It's something that has been part of Kroger for a long, long time. And we continue to even be -- add more innovation and more lines in terms of the Kroger brand itself, Private Selection and Simple Truth. So anytime a CPG adds -- changes cost versus what the market is doing from raw materials, what happens is our brands gain share as well, and that's also something I think is important to remind everybody. \nOperator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: Just curious. So back to the 2020 goals, I mean, obviously, you gave a pretty detailed answer on what was a little tougher. I think pharmacy stands out and ID is obviously taking a little longer. But fuel has obviously been a much bigger tailwind for you. So -- and I get that hasn't changed. That's been the case, fuel continues to be a tailwind for you. So I guess what I'm curious about is what really changed from 1Q when you reiterated the $3.5 billion to today? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks for the question, Karen. Certainly, from a fuel perspective to kind of cover the first part, you're absolutely right. From an overall performance of the business this year, we feel the fuel business has continued to demonstrate great strength. And it demonstrates the sort of the value, we believe, in the diversity of the portfolio of business that we now have. Obviously, everything is built up the foundation of food and that frequency of shop and the way customers are engaging with us and the loyalty we create. But when you think about food alongside health care, the fuel margins that we're generating in our alternative profit streams, we feel good about the way it allows us to manage through some of these changes as they -- as we see them that are outside of our control, and particularly in the case of the pharmacy headwinds that we referred to earlier on the call.\n As we talk around 2020, as Rodney mentioned, we do want to make sure we provide you with a lot more color at the November meeting around how we're thinking about the growth in the business. I know Rodney has obviously already referred to a couple of elements around areas of the business that we've learned a lot. And as you alluded to in your comments, we've shared, I think, very openly that we embarked on a major transformation for the company, which involved transforming the experience in the stores. And digitally, it involves standing up a number of new businesses around alternative profit streams and taking a dramatic amount of costs out of the business.\n So I think a lot of what we've been learning, as we've shared, is that as we get smarter and better in understanding how will those pieces come together and the speed at which they will deliver the benefits that we're expecting to Restock Kroger, we thought it was important to share with you today that we do believe that we'll deliver growth next year and operating -- FIFO operating profit over the confirmed guidance for 2019 and that we want to make sure that we spend the appropriate amount of time in November really taking you through what's worked, the areas where we believe we still have opportunity to improve and how we see 2020 further shaping up. \nW. McMullen: And 2020 and beyond as well. \nKaren Short: Okay. That is fair. And then I guess looking at the results this quarter, given obviously, again, strong fuel, I get core down 30-ish, 31% in 2Q. And I think it's fair to say that some of that is not within your control because it is pharmacy-related. So wondering if you could just get me -- give some color as to whether or not that number is kind of consistent with where your numbers shake out. But also maybe if you could parse out what the actual pharmacy, both specialty and regular pharmacy, might have done in terms of pressuring the core. \nGary Millerchip: I think that the best guidance we can give, kind of if we just refer back to a few of the points that we shared in the release and some of the comments that we made, Rodney mentioned it, from a supermarket perspective, when you take out fuel and retail pharmacy, essentially, the operating margins are relatively stable. And the pharmacy and the Kroger specialty pharmacy business were obviously a meaningful headwind during the quarter because of some of the industry headwinds that we see overall.\n But when you look at the investment in gross margin of 12 basis points that we shared around the supermarket business, excluding retail, pharmacy and fuel, and then the 14 basis points of OG&A benefit that we saw in the quarter, that's kind of really where I think is the best kind of data we would point you to, to give you a sense of what's going on in the business. And obviously, the gross margin, excluding fuel gross margin, investment was 29 basis points. And you get a sense of the disconnect, if you like, between what the health business impact to the quarter versus what the core retail gross margin investment was excluding pharmacy.\n Sorry, we just have time for one last question. \nOperator: And that question will come from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. \nThomas Palmer: It's Tom Palmer on for Ken. Just a couple quick ones for you. First, you called out hurricanes as a tailwind a year ago for the third quarter. Is -- I mean, is there going to be some offset in the southeast just given what we've seen with maybe people stocking up for Dorian? \nW. McMullen: Dorian was helped a little bit but not to the same degree as the hurricanes last year hit that center. And if you look in terms of just timing, the next 3 or 4 days will look altogether different because when a hurricane actually hits, then you have stores closed and customers aren't able to get into the business, into our stores. The thing about -- as you know, in hurricanes, you never know when the next one is going to hit. And what we always try to do is to make sure that we're ready there in advance for our customers. We support our associates and we're there. As soon as it's safe to be back, we get our stores back and open and operating. And we'll have -- our associates will go to whatever store they can get to, to work versus their home store. But anything at all, as soon as it's safe -- we understand we're an essential component of a community and make sure we're there for them. So I always say Kroger is at its best when there's events like this happens in terms of supporting communities and people. \nThomas Palmer: And then you've alluded to kind of the ability to look towards share repurchases again. Is that contemplated in your guidance for this year? Or would that essentially be upside if you go that direction? \nW. McMullen: At this point, we really haven't made any decision on repurchases for the balance of the year. And if there was anything, it would be extremely modest. As you know, we just now got back into the range. As Gary mentioned, we want to make sure that we're judicious and not -- and look at cash flow as it's being generated and balance all the pieces. So at this point, I think it's a little early to say. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? \nGary Millerchip: I think that's right, Rodney. Certainly, we're actively looking and making sure that we're maximizing free cash flow. But at this point, we want to make sure we're consistent within the range and as soon as we feel we're in that position, but it's certainly not contemplated currently in the guidance that we provided for 2019. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, everyone, for all the questions. So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed toward our associates who listen in and how we all live our purpose every day.\n To our associates, thank you for your hard work. I am fortunate to meet so many of you across the company and hear the incredible stories of what you do every day for each other and the communities. From our stores to plants and distribution centers and our corporate and division teams, you inspire me beyond my ability to express in words. Your passion for and focus on our customers is just incredible. More importantly, I am so proud of how you support each other and come together as a team. We are 460,000 strong, and we are Kroger proud.\n September is a special month for us as it marks the second anniversary of Kroger's social impact plan, Zero Hunger | Zero Waste. We know we can't achieve this goal alone. And recently, the Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation announced its inaugural cohort of 7 innovators who will join us in achieving our bold goal. Thank you to all of our customers, associates and suppliers who make our business successful every day of the year.\n That completes our call today. Thanks for joining, and we look forward to seeing you in November. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's second quarter 2019 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.\n Kroger is focused on executing the second year of our Restock Kroger plan to generate shareholder value by serving America through food inspiration and uplift. Restock Kroger has 4 main drivers: redefine the grocery customer experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Combined, these drivers come together to create shareholder value.\n We are halfway through the second year of our 3-year plan. We continue making strategic investments to reposition the company for the future while continuing to grow and deliver today. We started this conversation the last 2 quarters by acknowledging we had our work cut out for us. As always, we remain energized by that challenge. While we're always continually driving for improvement, there are several examples in our second quarter results that reflect the disciplined focus of Restock Kroger blueprint is paying off.\n Guided by our customer obsession, Kroger delivered our best identical sales results since the launch of our transformational plan. Our internal customer measures are improving even faster than our identical sales growth. There is always a lag between improving the customer experience and when the customer will reward us. Some other positive trends during the second quarter include FIFO operating margin that was stable in our supermarket business, excluding fuel and pharmacy. 15 of our divisions had increasingly -- increasing supermarket identical sales without fuel compared to the first quarter.\n We continue to reduce costs. We are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth.\n We continue to make significant investments to redefine the grocery customer experience. We are building a platform of seamless experiences to serve customers anything they want, anytime they want, anywhere they want. We know the seamless experience is essential to the customer experience, both today and tomorrow, which is why we continue to invest heavily in our capabilities in this area.\n Kroger's digital sales grew by a solid 31% in the second quarter. Pickup and delivery sales growth continued to perform in the mid-30% during the quarter. Going forward, we expect our digital sales growth rate to moderate year-over-year primarily due to the cycling of Home Chef and as a result of our disciplined focus on growing the Ship customer of our other digital offerings like Vitacost. Vitacost remains an important part of our business, and our growth in Ship is in part thanks to what we've gained from their platform and talent.\n We've also expanded our digital coverage area to reach 95% of our customers. This means that 95% of our customers who shop Kroger at a brick-and-mortar store can also shop with us for pickup or delivery. Importantly, we are starting to see improving operating profit trends in our digital business. Our digital business is becoming less of a headwind, which is an important inflection point, and we continue to invest in new capabilities to support our transition to seamless. However, I do want to note, this is still a significant investment for the company.\n A great example of partnering for customer value is our continued rollout of Ocado sheds. In July, Kroger and Ocado announced plans for a new high-tech customer fulfillment center in Forest Park, Georgia. What's so exciting about Ocado is that their model to deliver to customers is significantly less costly than our existing model. So not only will sheds accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience, they will also help us to do it in a much more cost-effective way.\n We know Ocado's value is not just its current capabilities but also in how quickly the company is able to innovate to serve a rapidly developing online consumer market. Ocado's technology team of over 1,400 software engineers brings a huge depth of talent and a long track record of innovation to growing opportunities in online grocery retail.\n We also announced an expansion of our relationship with Walgreens to a new test area in Knoxville, Tennessee. Starting this fall, 35 Walgreens stores in the area will feature a curated selection of Kroger's popular Our Brands products like Simple Truth, America's largest natural organic brand, along with national brand products.\n Kroger's Our Brand sales grew 3.1% this quarter. Retail and unit share growth led to the highest second quarter share in Our Brands' history. We also introduced 203 new Our Brand items during the second quarter. Our customers' favorite new items near key food and flavor trends we predicted and then shared with our investor community last year at Investor Day. And those new items delivered more than $137 million in incremental sales during the second quarter, further bolstering our supermarket business. We were thrilled to share the news last week that Kroger is leading the way with the widest assortment of plant-based protein among U.S. retailers through our Simple Truth brand.\n We continue to see progress in alternative profit streams with Media and Kroger Personal Finance as the primary growth drivers. Gary will share additional commentary on the progress of our alternative profit streams in his section.\n Now moving to talent development. As we previously shared, we are proud that our average hourly rate is over $20 per hour with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. As a result of Kroger's talent development investments, we are significantly improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger by supporting associates in a variety of ways, including investment in wages, training and development.\n Feed Your Future is our industry-leading education assistance program continues to build momentum. Among all the participants, more than 85% are hourly store associates. Since inception of the program last year, we've distributed 3,000 awards totaling $5.1 million in education assistance.\n In addition to continuing to develop talent internally, we continue to recruit talent from the outside, especially in the areas of digital, technology and supermarkets. Increasingly, customers, associates, stakeholders and U.S. investors are choosing who to partner with based on a purpose and values. We were pleased to see the business roundtable's recent announcement, acknowledging that businesses have a responsibility to be a positive influence on society. Kroger has always been focused on being a trusted partner in communities and committed to social purpose.\n In the second quarter, we were proud to publish our 2019 environmental, social and governance report, reflecting our efforts across the company to be environmentally responsible and a positive influence on society. The report detailed progress on Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan as well as our 2020 sustainability goals.\n Other items highlighted in the report included our 9% reduction in food waste generated by retail stores. We achieved a 13% improvement in supermarket food waste diverted from landfills, moving from 27% diversion in 2017 to 40% in 2018. We reduced the amount of plastic resin in Our Brands packaging by 9.1 million pounds so far, well on our way to achieving our 10 million pound goal by 2020.\n I will now turn it over to Gary for more detail into our quarterly financials. Gary? Thanks, Gary. As Rebekah said earlier, our Annual Kroger Investor Day is coming up in New York on November 5.\n As Gary just mentioned, we reconfirmed our 2019 guidance for identical sales, excluding fuel, adjusted EPS and adjusted FIFO operating profit as well as reconfirmed that we are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth. We want to be clear on today's call that we are not reconfirming the 3-year $400 million in incremental operating profit expectation. In November, we will give detailed 2020 annual guidance. I do want to highlight that we do expect to deliver FIFO operating profit growth in 2020 over 2019 confirmed guidance. We have outlined a handful of key goals for our Investor Day and would like to use this opportunity to provide you with a preview.\n At Investor Day, we plan to reinforce our commitment to the overall framework of our Restock Kroger transformation plan, sharing what has worked well and what has not worked well thus far. We intend to do a deep dive into our supermarket business, which underpins the redefining grocery customer experience pillar of Restock Kroger. November 5 is the appropriate forum to be deliberate and to allow the experts on our team to spend the proper amount of time with our financial stakeholders to explain how we are thinking about Kroger's business model and how to measure the shareholder value created by Restock Kroger. Several of our senior executives will give detailed updates on our progress against the key metrics in our supermarket business and our momentum as well as how we think about it going forward. We will reiterate the ongoing successful results behind our asset-light, margin-rich alternative profit businesses. We will also talk about the continued strength in free cash flow since the announcement of Restock Kroger, which enabled us to get back to within our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range earlier than expected. In addition, we will share our views on the business as we look further out beyond 2020 where growth is expected to continue.\n I've said it many times before. Transformation is incredibly difficult, and that's the journey we are on with Restock Kroger. As we reflect on this journey, we want to be transparent about what went according to plan and what didn't go as anticipated. Some things are coming to fruition as we expected but just later than we thought such as identical sales momentum. Some things were unanticipated such as the lower gross profit margin in the pharmacy business that the entire industry is experiencing. Things we did expect and that are going even better than we thought include productivity improvements and cost savings.\n Over the course of the 3-year plan and today's retail environment, there are lots of puts and takes. That said, I want to reiterate that Kroger is committed to FIFO operating profit growth in 2020 over 2019 confirmed guidance.\n The Restock Kroger transformation journey sets the company up for long-term growth looking forward. And the benefits we have seen thus far have helped Kroger in our transformation from grocer to growth company. We have the right overall strategy and framework for this business and look forward to telling you more about it in November.\n Now Gary and I will take your questions. Yes. As I mentioned in the call, in the prepared remarks, it was broad-based across most divisions. The area that we saw the biggest year-on-year improvement is average spend per item. Customers continue to go upscale and buy bigger product sizes. We also saw continued improvement in loyal households in terms of the numbers and the frequency of their visits. The other pieces to me that I was especially proud of our team is it's broad-based and it's really using our data to connect with customers one on one. If you look at quarter-to-date, obviously, a year ago, there was a hurricane that affected a couple of our divisions in a meaningful way. And we're in the middle of that happening a year ago. If you exclude those 2 divisions, we would be slightly ahead of where we were in quarter 2, but it's just slightly. And we -- I've excluded those 2 divisions just because until we get through the total cycling, it's really hard to say exactly where we'll be. But continued progress. The -- one, the one point you made, I think, is incredibly important. If you look at the pharmacy customer, that customer is incredibly loyal to Kroger. And when you look at their total spend, it's a fantastic customer to have. When you look at the pharmacy business overall, it continues to be very, very profitable relative to the assets invested. And obviously, year-on-year, there's headwind. But when you look at the total business, it still continues to be a strong business.\n The other thing is our pharmacy team has done an incredible job on -- to identifying opportunities to build the business, which obviously get a flow-through benefit of that, and significant operating changes to take costs out of the business. Now taking costs out of the business mitigated a meaningful part of the gross pressure, but still, there is more things to be done on taking costs out and process changes. So when you look at the business overall, I'm incredibly excited about the progress we're making. But looking forward, I think it's still a critical and important component of our overall business strategy. Well, I would say we have an estimate on expectations on that, and it would be different depending on whether it's in existing market or a new market. And if you look at our budget expectations in a new market, it would take longer for ramp to profitability versus an existing market where you can move volume over on day 1.\n The modeling that we've done is really using the experience Ocado has had in their ramp-ups in England and adjusting it for traffic patterns in the U.S. locations of our stores, location of customers and labor rates and those types of things. Obviously, until you get a facility open, you don't know whether all of those assumptions are correct. We would typically expect a facility to be somewhere year 2 to year 3 before it gets to profitability. But that is -- time will tell but the best of our estimates and best of the experience that Ocado has had.\n The other thing that we're hoping is if you look at each facility Ocado has opened, it keeps -- it gets better on a ramp-up than the prior one. And one of the nice things is that Ocado will open up a facility in Canada that we'll be able to learn from as well plus the learnings they've had. And that's the one piece that we haven't included in the budget is the fact that they keep getting better. Yes. And Gary just implied and I talked about it in the prepared remarks, Ocado is significantly more efficient than the way we're doing it today. Yes. A couple of comments. And as you mentioned, we'll get to a whole lot more detail in November on all the pieces, and we'll also talk about 2020 and beyond. If you look at the key drivers, it would continue to be identical sales growth. Obviously, managing our gross profit margin. We continue to find a lot of cost opportunities, everything from process changes to cost of goods to goods not for resale. And in fact, one of the things that we're identifying there is there's a longer stream of opportunities than what we had even originally expected as part of Restock Kroger.\n On the guidance for 2020, that was the reason that I made the comment that we did want to be clear that we expect 2020 operating profit dollars to grow over 2019 provided guidance, just to make sure that people understood that we do expect a growth. We're in the middle of the process, and it's a process normally we wouldn't finish until March of next year when we would give this next year guidance. We are accelerating it until November because we think it's incredibly important to do that, but we are in the process on specifics. But we did want to make sure that everybody understood that we do expect growth. Sure. Yes. A couple of those tie back to what we talked about before. But the pharmacy, obviously, is at a different level than what we expected when we did the original expectations just in terms of market structural changes that's happened to everybody in the industry. Obviously, identical sales made progress -- are making progress, but it's taking us longer than what we expected. If you look at alternative profit, it continues to be ahead of what we expected and continues to grow strongly. And in November, we will give more details on all of those. And productivity and process changes and cost opportunities, we continue to see a big pipeline for those and even more than what we originally expected. And just to remind everybody, we're taking over $1 billion a year of costs out to operate the company. No. I would -- when you look at the competitive environment overall, I would say it's pretty similar to what we thought at the time. The pharmacy would be the exclusion to that, that I mentioned. But when you look at new operators in the market, we assumed that it would continue to be important. We've been proactive, especially since we merged with Harris Teeter, making sure that we created seamless experience and have a strong digital offering. And I always tell everybody, job one is to make sure we don't lose the customer; job two is we'll figure out how to make it profitable. And we're indifferent whether somebody shops digitally with us or in a store. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this quarter, we actually saw that headwind was less in the second quarter year-on-year from a digital standpoint.\n So when you look at overall, I would say, we would say pretty much what we expected. Pharmacy is a little different. And we knew that there would be a transition period that we needed to transform the company, which is what drove us behind the Restock Kroger commitments. We'll get into more details in November. But a couple of comments I would add to your comments, and I mentioned it in the first quarter earnings call. If you look at the things that we measure internally in terms of how -- the feedback customers give us on what kind of experience we're giving them, what we find is that there's always a lag behind identical sales and when the customer tells us we're doing a better job. And when you look at the second quarter, we certainly felt like that was a reflection of that and we continue to improve the experience. To get into a lot more details on it, I really think we're probably better off to where we have a lot of time in November where we can go line by line. But I do think it was important for everybody to understand we do expect 2020 to have operating profit growth over the '19 confirmed commitment. Yes. If you look at market share overall, we would say basically it's flat. It's within -- it's probably up or down as mentioned, but I would say we're not satisfied, but it's moving in the right direction. Thanks, Robby. And Gary -- I agree with Gary's point, and we also continue to invest in Ship and some of the other components as well. That is a high start-up cost, but that's even reflected in the numbers that Gary talked about. The other thing, Gary, just one addition that I think is always important to remind and we always remind our CPG partners, if they're raising costs more than the market is going up, our own brands always gains share. And it's incredible, strong quality product obviously. It's something that has been part of Kroger for a long, long time. And we continue to even be -- add more innovation and more lines in terms of the Kroger brand itself, Private Selection and Simple Truth. So anytime a CPG adds -- changes cost versus what the market is doing from raw materials, what happens is our brands gain share as well, and that's also something I think is important to remind everybody. And 2020 and beyond as well. Dorian was helped a little bit but not to the same degree as the hurricanes last year hit that center. And if you look in terms of just timing, the next 3 or 4 days will look altogether different because when a hurricane actually hits, then you have stores closed and customers aren't able to get into the business, into our stores. The thing about -- as you know, in hurricanes, you never know when the next one is going to hit. And what we always try to do is to make sure that we're ready there in advance for our customers. We support our associates and we're there. As soon as it's safe to be back, we get our stores back and open and operating. And we'll have -- our associates will go to whatever store they can get to, to work versus their home store. But anything at all, as soon as it's safe -- we understand we're an essential component of a community and make sure we're there for them. So I always say Kroger is at its best when there's events like this happens in terms of supporting communities and people. At this point, we really haven't made any decision on repurchases for the balance of the year. And if there was anything, it would be extremely modest. As you know, we just now got back into the range. As Gary mentioned, we want to make sure that we're judicious and not -- and look at cash flow as it's being generated and balance all the pieces. So at this point, I think it's a little early to say. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? Thanks, everyone, for all the questions. So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed toward our associates who listen in and how we all live our purpose every day.\n To our associates, thank you for your hard work. I am fortunate to meet so many of you across the company and hear the incredible stories of what you do every day for each other and the communities. From our stores to plants and distribution centers and our corporate and division teams, you inspire me beyond my ability to express in words. Your passion for and focus on our customers is just incredible. More importantly, I am so proud of how you support each other and come together as a team. We are 460,000 strong, and we are Kroger proud.\n September is a special month for us as it marks the second anniversary of Kroger's social impact plan, Zero Hunger | Zero Waste. We know we can't achieve this goal alone. And recently, the Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation announced its inaugural cohort of 7 innovators who will join us in achieving our bold goal. Thank you to all of our customers, associates and suppliers who make our business successful every day of the year.\n That completes our call today. Thanks for joining, and we look forward to seeing you in November."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver for shareholders while we reposition the company for the future through Restock Kroger. For the quarter, we delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.44 per diluted share. I'd like to highlight a few areas on our business that were particularly robust.\n Our Brands contributed as both a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the second quarter and delivered on our Restock Kroger savings plans. The alternative profit businesses achieved budget, setting us up to deliver our incremental operating profit target for 2019. And our fuel performance was strong, helping mitigate pharmacy gross margin, LIFO and tax headwinds in the quarter. \n LIFO charge for the quarter was $30 million compared to $12 million for the same period last year driven by a higher-than-expected inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. Our adjusted corporate tax rate for the quarter was 23.9% compared to 18% in the same period last year. These 2 factors combined represented a $0.05 per diluted share headwind in the quarter compared to last year.\n As Rodney mentioned, Kroger reported identical sales without fuel at 2.2% during the second quarter, marking our strongest quarter since we launched our transformation plan. Several departments outperformed the company in the quarter, including key beverage categories, produce and natural foods. We were also pleased with top line momentum in our pharmacy business and experienced mid-single-digit increase in script counts. Overall, we are pleased with sales progress in the quarter, and we will continue to work to build on this momentum in the second half of the year.\n Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the second quarter was $626 million, an increase of 10.6% compared to the second quarter in 2018. Gross margin was 21.9% of sales for the second quarter. FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 29 basis points from the same period last year primarily driven by industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and continued growth in our specialty pharmacy business. Retail supermarkets, excluding fuel and retail pharmacy, saw 12 basis points of gross margin investment.\n Based on the needs of the business, we are focused on balancing margin investments and capturing cost of goods, sourcing savings and operational efficiencies to offset these investments. As a great example of this focus, our associates have done an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the second quarter compared to last year. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement.\n OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 14 basis points. This was achieved through continued focus on execution of Restock Kroger initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, store productivity and sourcing cost reductions.\n We always look for opportunities to improve free cash flow and ROIC, important metrics to Kroger shareholders. During the quarter, we accepted a substantial offer to sell an unused warehouse that had been on the market for some time. Kroger used the gain from this transaction as an opportunity to contribute a similar amount into the UFCW company pension plan, helping stabilize associates' future benefits. The net impact of these transactions to EPS growth was neutral.\n As we have previously shared, fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, and our loyal customers continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards each year in the form of price discounts at the pump. The average retail price of fuel was $2.71 this quarter compared with $2.85 in the same quarter last year. Retail fuel profit came in above our expectations for the quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the second quarter was $0.35 compared to $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the second quarter. We now expect fuel to be less of a headwind in the second half of the year than originally anticipated.\n Alternative profit streams are on track to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance will be the primary drivers of growth this year.\n Kroger Precision Marketing continued to build momentum in the quarter, increasing engagement to over 300 consumer packaged goods companies and experienced a 90% retention rate along with significantly higher spend. Kroger Personal Finance also saw growth in line with expectations during the quarter as we successfully expanded the number of customers and the frequency with which customers utilize these products.\n And now for an update on labor relations. We ratified the new labor agreement with the UFCW covering associates in Fort Wayne, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; and Nashville, Tennessee, during the second quarter. We also reached a tentative agreement with the UFCW covering 17,000 associates in our Ralphs division in Southern California earlier this week. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland and Seattle. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.\n Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\n Our financial strategy is to use our strong free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. We committed to prioritize free cash flow to reduce the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to within our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Over the last 12 months, net total debt has reduced by $1.3 billion, and Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.46 for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2.59 a year ago. We remain committed to our target net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range, and as we start to operate consistently within that range, we will explore options for returning additional capital to shareholders. Earlier this year, Kroger increased the dividend by 14%, marking the 13th consecutive year of dividend increases.\n Turning now to guidance for 2019. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.25% in 2019. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. We are pleased with our second quarter progress and are maintaining full year guidance to 2019.\n With pharmacy gross headwinds expected to continue in the second half of 2019 and as we lap a particularly strong OG&A performance in the third quarter of 2019 -- 2018, we now expect EPS to be flat in the third quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter, we expect double-digit EPS growth as we lap discrete items from prior year and continue to build strong momentum with our alternative profit streams.\n I'll now turn it back to Rodney. Rodney, maybe if I could just add a couple of things. I think what we're seeing, as Rodney mentioned in prepared comments too, is many of the elements that we shared in the early part of the year around the accelerators that we expected to help improve the trend in ID sales as we headed through the year have certainly started to show through in the metrics that we look at. So as you'll recall, we talked about as we start to lap the heavier price investments from last year and the space optimization changes that we made in -- predominantly in Q2 and early Q3 last year, as Rodney mentioned, is we're seeing the customer metrics that we look at internally and continue to execute better on starting to show through a trend and improving sales performance.\n And while we -- as we shared on the call and in the press release, the absolute digital sales growth was a lower rate. That was really an adjustment for the Home Chef purchase a year ago. And when you look at ClickList and home delivery, they are still performing very consistently and driving significant growth. And I think we see all those components continuing to build and certainly in a way that we look to the year and expected Q2 and Q3 and beyond to play out. We're seeing a lot of those elements that we expected starting to show through in the results. And the other piece to mention and you referred to it in your opening comments as well, we're learning a lot more as we continue to see as customers evolve digitally, engaging with us. And so we have a clear model in our mind of what our expectations are, but that model continues to evolve as we learn how customer behavior changes between delivery to home, between pickup at the store and really making sure that we're optimizing the efficiency and the innovation from Ocado to really support the whole digital ecosystem. And I think that's going to continue -- gets more exciting as we think about how the way the customer is changing and how Ocado can meet those needs in the future as well. Thanks for the follow-up questions. This is Gary. I'll take them in the order that you asked the questions. So on gross margins, certainly, we do continue to invest in price. And as Rodney mentioned, there are significant offsets in the investments that we're making in the way that we're managing cost of goods in the team. And over time, we expect, as we've shared, as we reclassified alternative profit, that will also become a tailwind that offsets investments and helps gross margin as well. So while we certainly believe that price investments are sort of critical part of the strategy, we do expect it to look different from what you would have seen in 2018 and 2017 in terms of a level of investment when you look at the time that we have for 2019 and the rest of the year.\n As you know, we use our data and insights, too, to really understand what's important for the customer. And we're continuing to make sure we're priced right on the products that matter most to the customer, both from everyday pricing and from the way we personalize the offers through using the data that we uniquely have available to us because 96% of data is tethered to a loyalty card. But we also know from customer insights that it's not just about price, and ultimately, our customers decide to shop at Kroger because certainly of value but then also the quality of the products, the personalization that we can offer through our data and the freshness and the experience. And so we do feel good around the plan for the rest of the year as we head into 2020 around how we'll manage those levers.\n From a free cash flow perspective, to the second part of your question, I'll really just maybe reinforce a couple of comments that we made in the prepared remarks that you should certainly expect Kroger to be -- continue to be focusing on how do we maximize free cash flow for the value of our shareholders. We are now about within the range. It's important to us that we demonstrate we are consistently back in the range because there can be some volatility in a retail business, and we want to make sure that we've delivered on our commitment to operate within the range. But certainly now that we're there and we expect to continue to generate free cash flow, we will be looking very closely at what's the most effective way to return capital to shareholders. Thanks for the question. So as Rodney mentioned, we really plan to give you far more detail in November. And we felt it was really important that we committed to doing that in 6 or 7 weeks from now to be able to provide all the color. We still have obviously huge confidence in the level of free cash flow that we're generating within the company and continues to be a strength in this year. I do think we would want to provide additional guidance on that alongside, as Rodney mentioned, our future financial strategy and how we create value for shareholders at the November meeting. So on digital, first of all, we are certainly -- continue to be very excited around what we see in the way that customers engage with us differently as they start to become more of a -- Rodney referred to as a seamless customer where we're delivering for the customer both, whether it's delivery to home or ship to home. And everything we see about the way that customer engages more deeply with us shows the value of that overall relationship across all the channels of store and digital working together. I know we've shared before that when we look at spend lift, we see a significant spend lift from the customer when they fill that first basket, it's a much higher basket and a significant part of that spend is incremental. And then over time, we also see customers actually move to a position where their visits in the store actually increase as well as they overall build their loyalty with us.\n And so you're right, Robby, it's very much a maturation curve, if you like. And so we monitor every store and every vintage of the business that goes through that maturation of launching pickup and launching delivery to home. And what we see is that, that curve where by about year 2, year 3 of the customer engagement in those stores, we start to become really agnostic around how the customer is shopping with us because of the incrementality that we see overall in that behavior and how that mold to Kroger.\n So as they're starting to come through that maturity curve, that's really what Rodney was referring to when he mentioned that we start to see digital less of a financial headwind in the Q2 this year and then into the second half of this year because we're really starting to see the maturation of that business, partly the customer behavior obviously accelerating, but also because we don't have the same start-up costs and the same investments in launching those services.\n So we certainly expect that to continue, and we are very focused on how do we maintain and accelerate the growth of customer engagement through digital. We were pleased that we have continuation of digital household engagement growing again during the quarter, and that's very much a focus for us. As we continue to grow their loyalty and we get past that maturation point, as Rodney said, it's still an investment overall for the business. So where we get even more excited when you think about the technology with Ocado and the opportunity to automate some of the back-end operation, if you like, providing those services because that has the potential to significantly shorten the path to profitability as well when you think about the way the customer shops with us seamlessly overall. That's essentially what we're seeing overall within the way we look at our digital business and the way you look at that customer maturation. That's right. But that's kind of what Rodney was referring to. Sure. Obviously, we deal with the question of CPG partners addressing price increases all the time. It's something that we deal with on a case-by-case basis, and we feel we're in a particularly strong position to really understand what's happening there because of our own brand products and the way in which we can have those conversations to make sure that the price increases are legitimate cost increases coming through to us. Certainly, as we shared, we are seeing our range for the year on inflation which we were assuming it would be somewhere between 0 to 1% and what we're actually seeing in a couple of those categories that I mentioned in the prepared comments that we're slightly ahead of that range. We continue to obviously manage to try and mitigate those through cost of goods opportunities and certainly where we do see the price increases coming through. And we believe they're legitimate, we are looking to pass them on to customers where it makes sense in light of the competitive environment. Thanks for the question, Karen. Certainly, from a fuel perspective to kind of cover the first part, you're absolutely right. From an overall performance of the business this year, we feel the fuel business has continued to demonstrate great strength. And it demonstrates the sort of the value, we believe, in the diversity of the portfolio of business that we now have. Obviously, everything is built up the foundation of food and that frequency of shop and the way customers are engaging with us and the loyalty we create. But when you think about food alongside health care, the fuel margins that we're generating in our alternative profit streams, we feel good about the way it allows us to manage through some of these changes as they -- as we see them that are outside of our control, and particularly in the case of the pharmacy headwinds that we referred to earlier on the call.\n As we talk around 2020, as Rodney mentioned, we do want to make sure we provide you with a lot more color at the November meeting around how we're thinking about the growth in the business. I know Rodney has obviously already referred to a couple of elements around areas of the business that we've learned a lot. And as you alluded to in your comments, we've shared, I think, very openly that we embarked on a major transformation for the company, which involved transforming the experience in the stores. And digitally, it involves standing up a number of new businesses around alternative profit streams and taking a dramatic amount of costs out of the business.\n So I think a lot of what we've been learning, as we've shared, is that as we get smarter and better in understanding how will those pieces come together and the speed at which they will deliver the benefits that we're expecting to Restock Kroger, we thought it was important to share with you today that we do believe that we'll deliver growth next year and operating -- FIFO operating profit over the confirmed guidance for 2019 and that we want to make sure that we spend the appropriate amount of time in November really taking you through what's worked, the areas where we believe we still have opportunity to improve and how we see 2020 further shaping up. I think that the best guidance we can give, kind of if we just refer back to a few of the points that we shared in the release and some of the comments that we made, Rodney mentioned it, from a supermarket perspective, when you take out fuel and retail pharmacy, essentially, the operating margins are relatively stable. And the pharmacy and the Kroger specialty pharmacy business were obviously a meaningful headwind during the quarter because of some of the industry headwinds that we see overall.\n But when you look at the investment in gross margin of 12 basis points that we shared around the supermarket business, excluding retail, pharmacy and fuel, and then the 14 basis points of OG&A benefit that we saw in the quarter, that's kind of really where I think is the best kind of data we would point you to, to give you a sense of what's going on in the business. And obviously, the gross margin, excluding fuel gross margin, investment was 29 basis points. And you get a sense of the disconnect, if you like, between what the health business impact to the quarter versus what the core retail gross margin investment was excluding pharmacy.\n Sorry, we just have time for one last question. I think that's right, Rodney. Certainly, we're actively looking and making sure that we're maximizing free cash flow. But at this point, we want to make sure we're consistent within the range and as soon as we feel we're in that position, but it's certainly not contemplated currently in the guidance that we provided for 2019."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. \nRebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. \n Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. \n After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. \n I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2019 result is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. \n We started the conversation with you last quarter by acknowledging that we had our work cut out for us. We are energized by that challenge, and our team brought that energy to the first quarter. There are several examples in the first quarter results that reflect the discipline, focus and progress we are making on our transformation plan: Restock Kroger. All of this work starts with our customer-obsession focus. That is why we're building an omnichannel platform to serve customers with Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. That is why we're focused on redefining the experience grocery customers can expect to have in our stores and online, improved upon by existing -- exciting partnerships that create additional value. That said, while the second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start, we know we can do better when it comes to our identical sales results. To that end, it's important that I say right up front that by further intensifying our customer focus, Kroger's quarter-to-date identical sales are trending better than the first quarter and moving toward the guidance range.\n One of our most powerful competitive advantages is also one of our best ongoing performers. Kroger's own brand products grew 3.3%, and unit share gained 66 basis points to reach 28.9% share in the quarter. The focus on shifting the mix to Simple Truth and premium brands, such as Private Selection, led to double-digit gains in the quarter in those brands. We know that our customers love Our Brands and that they are hungry for innovative new products that they can only get by coming to and shopping with Kroger. \n In our quest to put food first and serve as America's food authority, we are bringing new tastes, trends and experiences to our customers. In the first quarter, we introduced 219 fantastic Our Brands items. Our customers' favorite new items fall in line with the key food and flavor trends we predicted for 2019, including Private Selection pork belly bites, Private Selection artisan jerky and Kroger Deluxe Unicorn Swirl Ice Cream. New items delivered over $225 million in incremental sales during the first quarter.\n Customer obsession is also why we're building a platform to serve customers anything they want, anytime they want, and anywhere they want. Our customers don't distinguish between an in-store and online experience. Rather, they typically have a food-related need or a problem to solve and want the easiest, most seamless solution. Our digital sales grew 42% in the first quarter. We also expanded our coverage area to reach 93% of our customers in the first quarter. This means 93% of the customers who shop Kroger in a brick-and-mortar store also can shop with us for pickup or delivery. By the end of this year, everyone in America will have the ability through our modalities to shop with Kroger, whether they decide to come into a store, use our pickup or delivery services or ship. Our efforts are positioning Kroger to be the leading omnichannel retailer in the food industry. Since 2014, we've gone from no digital sales dollars to a 2018 annual run rate of about $5 billion, which will trend toward a $9 billion digital sales run rate in the future. I called this out because while we are only in the middle of our transformation, it's important to frame up the magnitude of the progress that we have made.\n 2019 is another pivotal year for our Partner for Customer Value pillar and Restock Kroger. We continue to improve the customer experience in our stores and across our digital properties by partnering with industry innovators such as Home Chef, Microsoft, Ocado and Walgreens. All of these partners accelerate our ability to provide customers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. Each partner shares our passion for exploring the nexus between technology and innovative customer experiences. \n We were excited to break ground last week in Ohio on America's first customer fulfillment center powered by Ocado. Kroger's partnership with Ocado will, for the first time, introduce transformative e-commerce fulfillment and logistics technology in America. This, in turn, means Kroger customers will get fresher food faster than ever before. We intend to open additional customer fulfillment facilities to create a seamless customer experience, replicating the model to serve everyone across America.\n We are also making progress building out our alternative business for profitable growth. We've made several organizational structural changes to allow deeper concentration on our alternative profit stream while also maintaining our laser focus on delivering for our customers in the core business. Kroger is creating a virtuous cycle, built upon the rich collection of proprietary data generated from our customer traffic, to improve the customer experience, which then supports new margin-rich, asset-light businesses. We expect alternative profit streams to continue to grow and contribute an estimated incremental $100 million in net operating profit in 2019 and continue to accelerate into 2020. This will be generated primarily from the more mature alternative profit streams such as Kroger Personal Finance, our Media businesses and customer data insights. \n There are other initiatives within our alternative business portfolio that are in earlier stages of incubation. For example, we recently announced the formation of PearlRock Partners, a platform to identify, invest in and help grow the next generation of leading consumer product brands. Initiatives such as PearlRock Partners are expected to have a small impact during Restock Kroger and then contribute more meaningfully to our results after 2020. Following up on our commitment we made in March to our financial stakeholders, Gary will provide additional transparency about where alternative profits will flow through our financial statements during his remarks.\n One of the challenges transforming a company is finding the right leaders at the right time to guide and coach people through complex and often difficult change. The underlying principle is to respect the company's past while creating the future. We've secured Kroger's continued success in the next chapter of retail by proactively managing several pivotable next-generation leadership successions, including the essential CFO and CIO roles. We've also focused several senior-most executive roles, most notably leaders of our new business development, including partnerships, and Kroger's alternative business portfolio to support the transformation of our growth model. Every leadership transition is deliberate, carefully managed and made in partnership with Kroger's Board of Directors. I'd like to again congratulate all of our new senior vice presidents and underscore my confidence in their ability to lead Kroger forward.\n Another important area of leadership for Kroger is in the environmental, social and governance areas, which is a natural extension of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan and is gaining recognition from a growing number of investors. As America's grocer, we are committed to setting the table for a sustainable future. A year ago, we took a deeper look on how plastic is affecting our communities and environment and became the first major U.S. retailer to announce the phaseout of single-use plastic grocery bags, starting with our QFC division in the Pacific Northwest. Earlier this month, Kroger announced our commitment to be the exclusive U.S. grocery retail partner for Loop. Loop is a new system that uses durable product packaging to help reduce single-use plastics. TerraCycle introduced Loop at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January to much fanfare and media interest. Many familiar suppliers and brands are included in the platform, and the list continues to expand. Loop hygienically cleans and sanitizes the empty packaging that was previously sold to the consumer and sends it back to the suppliers to refill for another use.\n Because the retail industry is transforming, we proactively launched Restock Kroger to deliver for customers and our shareholders. Plainly stated, Restock Kroger is all about transforming our growth model. The second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start. The entire company is focused on redefining the grocery customer experience, improving upon our exciting partnerships that create value. We are investing in our associates more than ever before and building a purpose-driven culture, and we are also on track to generate the free cash flow and incremental adjusted FIFO operating profit targets for 2019. As I said earlier, we recognize we have work to do and remain focused on delivering on our Restock Kroger commitments.\n Now I'd like to turn it over to Gary Millerchip, who's been in the CFO role since April. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strength and diversity of Kroger's multifaceted business model. Overall, we are leveraging Kroger's unique assets, our scale, unmatched customer data insights and our knowledge of food to build even stronger connections with our customers across all modalities: in store, pickup, delivery and ship.\n As Rodney discussed, we have a few headwinds during the first quarter, including sales, which we know must be stronger. We also experienced pharmacy gross margin pressure similar to others in the industry. Because of our multifaceted business model, we delivered an adjusted EPS result of $0.72 per diluted share. \n I'd like to highlight a few areas of our business that were particularly strong during the quarter. Our Brands contributed both as a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the first quarter and delivered on our Restock Kroger savings plan. And alternative profit businesses exceeded budget, setting us up to deliver our incremental operating profit target for 2019.\n On that note, last quarter, we committed to providing you with greater transparency on our alternative businesses and their contribution to Restock Kroger. As Rodney said at the top of the call, we expect alternative profits to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. You will see this growth reflected through the gross margin line of our financial statements.\n Certain amounts that we've traditionally recognized as reductions to OG&A expenses and merchandising costs are now being reflected as sales. This treatment more appropriately reflects the nature of these items and is consistent with others in the industry. In the first quarter, this affected identical sales by 3 basis points, and we have provided more detail in our 8-K filing. Please refer to Table 8 for a deeper explanation on the reclassification.\n Through the first quarter of 2019, alternative businesses are ahead of our expectations, with Media business and Kroger Personal Finance leading the way. We expect incremental operating profit growth to vary throughout the year, reflecting the continued acceleration of our Media business and the seasonality of certain businesses during peak holiday selling periods. For example, our gift card business is very seasonal, and therefore, growth will be most visible in respective quarters.\n Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 1.5% during the first quarter. The timing of SNAP disbursement negatively affected results by 15 basis points. Several departments outperformed the company in the quarter, including key beverage categories, pet, natural foods, and we had another strong quarter from our pharmacy business. \n We recognize that getting into our identical sales guidance range will require an acceleration of identical sales throughout the rest of our fiscal year. We are diligently working to improve performance and build on the positive identical sales trend momentum we are seeing thus far in our second quarter. Additionally, as we move through the second quarter, we will begin to cycle investments made during the same period last year, which we expect to be a tailwind. \n Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the first quarter was $957 million and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin was 22.2% of sales for the first quarter, and FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 40 basis points from the same period last year, primarily due to industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy. This represents a sequential improvement in the level of margin investments compared to the second half of 2018. The LIFO charge for the quarter was $15 million. Our associates have done an amazing job managing shrink, which improved during the first quarter compared to the prior year. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of shrink rate improvement. OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and 2019 and 2018 first quarter adjustment items, decreased 12 basis points. This quarter's decrease is primarily due to the execution of Restock Kroger initiatives and planned real estate transactions. And by planned, I mean these transactions were contemplated in our EPS guidance for the year. Our results highlight the continued progress we are making with the Restock Kroger savings program, building on the $1.1 billion of savings and benefits achieved in our prior fiscal year. We are committed to continuing to find additional improvements and efficiencies in our business. \n Retail fuel profit growth was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but we still expect fuel operating profit to be a headwind overall in 2019, particularly in the second half of the year. Our cents-per-gallon fuel margin in the first quarter was $0.23 compared to $0.18 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.62 versus $2.63 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, especially among our most loyal households. We continue to increase our investment in fuel rewards and saw positive gallon growth with our loyal customers in the first quarter. \n Turning now to talent development. We are supporting associates in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger. Today, I'm pleased to share our recently updated average hourly rate is over $20 per hour with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. The most recent example of our investments in wages was our Monday announcement of a newly ratified labor contract covering store associates in Indianapolis. The ratified agreement with UFCW Local 700 raises starting wages for most clerks, and associates will receive regular wage increases every 6 months. This is part of our continued effort to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training.\n We are also very energized by the significant interest we're seeing from associates in Feed Your Future, our industry-leading education assistance program launched just over a year ago. Feed Your Future is available to all associates, full or part-time, after 6 months of service. Among all the participants, more than 80% are hourly store associates. As a result of our investments in talent development, we are significantly improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. \n In addition to the new labor agreement covering Kroger associates in Indianapolis, we also ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering King Soopers associates in Denver and Kroger associates in Louisville, Kentucky, during the first quarter. We are currently negotiating with UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland, Seattle and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefits package relevant to today's associates. \n Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\n A key component of Restock Kroger is generating strong free cash flow. Our financial strategy is to use free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash to achieve these goals. We reduced net total debt by $1.7 billion during -- since the end of fiscal year 2018. Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio is 2.54, down from 2.83 at the end of 2018. The company's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5. We have prioritized getting our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio back into the target range and use proceeds from the sale of YouTechnology and the Turkey Hill Dairy business to help us do so.\n I'd like to take a few moments to talk a little bit more about YouTech. This is a great example of how Kroger leveraged the unique assets I mentioned earlier to create significant value for our shareholders. We acquired the business for a nominal value several years ago and developed it into a market leader in digital coupons. When the business reached a point where the potential value to someone else was higher than the future value to Kroger, we sold the business to maximize shareholder return. As part of the terms of the sale, we protected the value to Kroger through a long-term service agreement with Inmar. YouTech is a great illustration of how we are leveraging our unique assets to create new asset-light, margin-rich businesses to drive incremental value for our shareholders. \n Before I turn it back to Rodney, I'd like to discuss an accounting change that affects our financial reporting and reiterate our guidance for 2019. You may have noticed in our 8-K filing that we adopted the new leasing standard at the beginning of the fiscal year. This added nearly $7 billion of lease-related assets and liabilities to our balance sheet. The rating agencies already calculate and include our liability for operating leases in their ratings assessments, and this new standard is not expected to affect rent expense or earnings for the year. \n Finally, I would like to reiterate our guidance for the year. For 2019, identical sales growth, excluding fuel, we continue to target identical rates that range from 2% to 2.25%. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. Kroger's EPS growth will come from adjusted FIFO operating profit growth in 2019, which positions us well to deliver on Restock Kroger. \n Rodney, back to you. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. We feel optimistic at the start of the second quarter. Sales momentum is building, and we are laser-focused on serving our customers. We are clear eyed about the challenges ahead and confident in our ability to deliver on our plans, both for the year and our long-term vision, to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. \n Now we look forward to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nRobert Ohmes: Rodney, my question is could you talk a little bit about, now that you're 1/4 into this year, how your price investment plan is trending? Is it more or less than what you were expecting? And maybe remind us what kind of price investment year 2019 is expected to be and maybe weave that into how that plays out into the expectation for accelerating IDs, and then also maybe weave in just the environment you're seeing out there competitively. We're seeing signs of the promotional environment in produce being a little more aggressive than it's been in a while. If you could weave the picture together for us, that would be great. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Robby. If you look at price investments overall, we're tracking really pretty consistent with where we expected it to be. We are continuing to cycle the investments we made during last year, so the flow-through of that will continue to be helpful. If you look at the '19 investments, it would be a reasonable amount. It will not be as much as what we did in '18 because, as you recall, when we had the tax law changes, we accelerated some of our '19 investments into '18 to give customers some of the value from the lower tax rate. \n When you look at the environment overall, there's always puts and takes. And overall, we would say it's pretty consistent with where it was before. We'll always see a specific area or category get more. But when you look it all in all, it looks pretty consistent with before. \n On accelerating the identicals, it really is -- one of the things on space optimization, now it's becoming a tailwind versus a headwind. Obviously, that's been -- has taken us longer than we expected, so that's been a positive. Just in terms of basic execution in the stores, our teams are doing a great job of improving the customer experience, which is adding momentum as well. And it's making sure that we use our data to target the right things to work on. So it's all of those things coming together and then being a little bit better at telling the customer our story. \nOperator: The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nJudah Frommer: Maybe, first, just a follow-up on IDs. Can you help us with the cadence throughout the quarter? It sounded like when you gave the quarter-to-date update with fourth quarter earnings that you were running better than where you finished the quarter, and obviously things are expected to accelerate. So beyond remodels, has there been enough contribution from the rollout of online grocery and the impact of inflation relative to your expectations? \nW. McMullen: Inflation was higher in the first quarter than before but pretty consistent with expectations. When you look at the first quarter overall, sales were moving up nicely and continuing to make -- tracking as expected and making great progress up through Easter. Right after Easter, we hit a wall, and I always hate to use weather as an excuse for anything. But there's no doubt that when you look at the weather categories, we saw quite a bit of impact just because of -- if you look at Mother's Day, the things around Mother's Day and grilling out and all those things. As I mentioned, SNAP was a slight headwind but not a huge amount. When you look at it in total for the quarter, we continue to have great growth in loyal household growth. And if you look at spend per item, we saw people continuing to move upscale and continue to purchase bigger packs. And as I mentioned earlier, when we're looking at the second quarter so far, it's only 3 weeks, but we are moving closer to the '19 guidance. \nGary Millerchip: Rodney, the only thing I would add... \nJudah Frommer: Okay. Great. And then... \nGary Millerchip: So I think the question was asked around digital, too, as part of the overall performance, and we continue to see strong results, and certainly in line with what we expected during the first quarter from the way customers are engaging through the seamless digital experience that we're creating, both in terms of ordering online to pick up at the store and also ordering online to ship to home or deliver to home. \nJudah Frommer: Okay. And if I could quickly follow up on Media. It sounds like trends are going kind of in line with or above plan there. Clearly, some of your big-box competitors have made moves in the media space, sometimes acquiring external assets. Is that something you feel like you need to do? Does their leaning into these retailer-led platforms help your conversations with vendors? Or does it serve as more competition? \nW. McMullen: Yes. For us, we view it as additional partners helping CPGs to help them better spend their money. And when we really look at it, we're able to help CPGs to understand -- and you remember the old adage that half of my media is wasted, I just don't know which half. And our teams are able to do a great job on being able to help media companies understand where you spend money and what's the behavior of the customer. And we view the market as big enough to where there's plenty of opportunity for the market to grow overall and for the other companies that you referenced, for all of us to be successful, just because it's such a large market. So when we look at the opportunity, it's incredibly exciting. I know some of the early partners are really happy with the results, and we're just getting started. \n In terms of acquiring somebody, so far we've been able to partner with world-class companies to really accelerate our journey. Now whether that changes over time, I think it's to be determined. \nOperator: The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Yes. Just, first, a clarification. The planned real estate transaction in the quarter, if I look at the cash flow statement, there is about a $57 million gain. Is that the amount that we should be thinking about that contributed to the quarter? \nGary Millerchip: Jeff, it's Gary. That's right, Ed. We -- as we mentioned in the prepared notes, we actually had this transaction planned as part of the guidance for the year and part of our business plan. I think you're aware, but real estate has always been part of our overall strategy as to how do we make the best use and leverage the assets that we have available to us and that we're creating as we build out a store around a shopping center and as we start to really make the most of being that anchor tenant in many of the places that we operate. So for many years, we've had real estate transactions in our results. Often, they can be some losses as well as gains sometimes during those quarters. We felt that this quarter, because it was a bigger amount than it would normally be, it was important that we were transparent, especially as obviously it helped the OG&A rate to look better overall in the quarter because of that onetime transaction. But it was absolutely contemplated, and it was part of our expectations actually in the first quarter as well. \nEdward Kelly: Any other planned real estate transactions like this contemplated for the full year? \nGary Millerchip: I think we are always obviously looking at opportunities and especially where it can help our free cash flow and where we can arbitrage the profitability of the real estate that we own currently. So I wouldn't get into specific details around any of the overall plans that we have, but we do certainly look for those opportunities where they exist, but they're not contemplated within the guidance that we shared. \nW. McMullen: And, Ed, this is Rodney. If it was anything material, we would share it as well so that everybody would know. And as Gary mentioned, it's in the guidance. \nEdward Kelly: Rodney, my real question here is for you, and it's on the IDs. And bigger picture, you used to consistently outperform a broader peer set and industry data like Nielsen. And to me, one of the biggest issues right now with your company is that, that actually no longer seems to be happening. And your IDs are just north of 1% this quarter despite the fact that you have digital in there, specialty's in there now. You are lapping some optimization. You've invested a lot last year. I guess why do you think the share gains have slowed so much? And I know you're focused on improving momentum, but what specific adjustments are you making? \nW. McMullen: It really is, for us, to step up our game. And if you look at the customer experience, we've made significant improvement in some of the basic customer experience. What we find is there's a lag between when you make those improvements and when the customer starts rewarding you with their checkbook. And so part of the -- and this is using the data that we track every week, how are we doing in terms of the friendliness of our associates, in-stock and all of those pieces. And the progress that we've made is stronger than our progress in our identicals. The other part is some of the things I mentioned before, is just cycling space optimization and the other projects and getting a return from the remodels that we're doing and using the data in a continued, sophisticated way but even growing upon that as what we've had in the past. \nOperator: The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nErica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I actually wanted to touch on food inflation. Can you maybe get a little bit more granular in terms of what you're seeing currently and your expectations going forward? And then maybe you could talk about, are you seeing prices being passed through to the shelf at this point? \nGary Millerchip: Sure. I'd be happy to talk about that. So as you know, when we talked about our guidance for the year, our expectation was that we'd see inflation in the range of 0% to 1%. That was what we've built our plan around. And I would say if you look at Q1 results and exclude pharmacy and fuel from the calculation, we would be at the top end of that range. Certainly, as we are seeing those cost increases come through, we have a very robust process within our cost of goods team to really look at ways in which we can mitigate those cost increases and ensure that we're able to maintain profitability in the business. Where we are seeing the legitimate reason for those costs coming through, we are generally being successful in passing them on to the customer through the pricing strategy. And I would say that's generally what we saw during the first quarter and would be our strategy during the rest of the year. One of the things that obviously we feel is an important advantage for us is the significant market share that we have with our own brand products, and so ensuring that we're using that to really manage and balance as we see price increases come through. And of course, it's a great set of knowledge for us knowing what the true cost of product is and how to effectively manage those cost increases. \nErica Eiler: Okay. That's helpful. And then... \nGary Millerchip: I think our outlook... \nErica Eiler: Oh, no, keep going. \nGary Millerchip: No. I was just going to say I think our outlook for the year, in general, would be in the -- would be similar to what we've been experiencing, except for, of course, some of the challenges and uncertainties that are being created by some discussion on some potential trade impacts and obviously some things like the swine flu that was also out there. So there are obviously 1 or 2 items that we're watching very closely because they have the potential to impact inflation in a more meaningful way. \nW. McMullen: And tariffs from China has pretty minimal effect on us, and a lot of it can be managed. Tariffs from Mexico would be harder to manage. Hopefully, something works out there. As you know, overall, from a philosophy standpoint, we always believe that at the end of the day, tariffs just cause costs to go up for customers. \nErica Eiler: Okay. No. That's great additional color. And then just quickly on gross margins. Can you talk about the dynamics going on with pharmacy right now and the industry as it relates to gross margin and how you're thinking about kind of those dynamics going forward? \nGary Millerchip: Sure. First of all, I'd like to just maybe give a little bit more context on our pharmacy business, too, because it's certainly a very important part of our business. It drives a lot of loyalty overall with the customer, and we continue to get extremely strong customer satisfaction ratings. It's a part of our business that generally is continuing to grow script counts and grow sales very strongly, as we mentioned, during the quarter. And it ties very closely for us to our health and wellness strategy. And as we start to think about food as medicine, we think it's a very important connection. \n The business today is profitable for us and generates a high ROIC. But as you mentioned, we are certainly seeing some pressure in the industry. There's a couple of things at play, really, within the gross margin pressure that we saw in Q1 which, as I mentioned, wouldn't be unique to us. The first is there is a generic supply challenge, and therefore the cost of supplying product has gone up significantly. And secondly, as we've renegotiated our PPM agreements, 3 of the big ones going through the renegotiation process, there's an increase in costs there that's also placing some pressure on gross margin. That being said, our pharmacy team has been extremely proactive in developing plans to mitigate that, both from how do we buy most effectively but also how do we create more efficiency in the pharmacy business. And we continue to see significant efficiency improvements in the cost to fill a pharmacy order, and our pharmacy team are doing a really nice job of finding ways to offset some of those pressures. \nW. McMullen: And as I mentioned before, it's also the nice thing about having a multifaceted business where other things, the growth in our Own Brands and other things that I mentioned, in total, we still had great results. And also, as we look -- move forward, we see health and wellness as a huge opportunity in terms of from an alternative business standpoint and creating new partnerships to be able to help America live a healthier life. And as Gary mentioned, everything that we see, discussions with a lot of different health care providers, we increasingly see food as medicine. And if you look at our OptUP app and some of those things, we're able to help people eat healthier, and we see that as an opportunity even bigger in the future than it's been in the past. \nOperator: The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: Rodney, can you address the topic of the organization's capacity for change, right? So you've got a lot of change going on. You've got people in new roles. Do you think that, all of that, other than maybe space optimization, is impacting execution in any way and maybe impacting your top line growth? And then as you go forward, if there might be some of that, is there a way to sort of streamline things, prioritize so that maybe there's -- you impact the organization's ability to manage that change better? Curious to your thoughts on that. \nW. McMullen: Yes. A great question, John, and it's something that we talk about, obviously, routinely. It was one of the reasons that we made some of the organizational changes that we made and moving alternative business to its own stand-alone area because we wanted to make sure that we had -- it's a huge opportunity -- we had dedicated people focused on it, and we didn't have people that were responsible for the daily interaction with the customer trying to do both. And one of the things I always like to --  for us to ask ourselves is, is it center of plate or corner of plate, [ corner of that ]? And if it's center, that's incredibly important. So I feel incredibly good about the people that we've put in place and making sure that the clarity is separating from all the pieces. \n We have recruited some external talent over the last several months to help us supplement the internal talent that we already had in terms of some of our operating areas, some of our vice presidents. And on our digital team, we've recruited a ton of talent from the outside to accelerate our digital journey. \n So it's -- to me, I think it's a great question. We spend a lot of energy on it. When you look at the operating side of the business, we have a lot of new people in role over the last couple of years. It always takes a little while for new talent to hit their stride, and I feel really good about how they're growing and the progress we're starting to make on the customer connection attributes. And it's starting to show up in loyal customer growth, so it's making progress. We feel really good about the talent we have in place, and we're starting to make some accelerated progress. \nJohn Heinbockel: And then I know it's early, but what have you learned with the Walgreen test in Cincinnati, particularly as you kind of look forward to opening up the Ocado sheds in non-Kroger markets? Have you learned anything definitive or not yet? \nW. McMullen: Yes. It's still very, very early, and I would say the thing that has been incredibly positive is Walgreens, their team and their store teams are a fantastic partner. And both of us are learning things, the customer likes and dislikes, together, and we really see it as something that we continue to understand the customer desires and changes and adapting to that. And it's pretty early on. I know, Gary, you're much closer to it from a day-to-day basis, so I'll let you add some of the specific color. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Sure. I think that some of the things that we're learning and we like so far, John, with what we're seeing, first of all, by having the level of convenience now that we have with those 13 stores in Northern Kentucky, alongside 10 of our own stores with the pickup service, we're getting great feedback on both the fact that we're even a different level of convenience than we were before. And this ability to get in and out really quickly is certainly something that is resonating very well with the customers that are using the service. We're also starting to see some positive feedback from customers around the speed of in and out for those small shopping trips and the ability to be able to get what I need for today and what I need for tonight, whether it's for lunch or dinner, and that's certainly a real positive. What we find generally with the small-format stores, there is a ramp-up as customers become more comfortable with their shopping behavior. We've seen that with our own small-format stores, and we've seen it over the years with convenience stores. So the biggest thing for us now is really poring over the data and making sure that we're using a data-driven approach to continue to enhance the service and the experience. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Can you give us more clarity on how the past year -- full year operating profit guidance works? Thus far, you're trending a little bit below your ID sales range, even currently in the quarter. Sounds like the pharmacy gross margin pressure has been greater than you expected, and you got a real estate gain in the first quarter and yet your profits were still down. So what's the path that you can take from here to get to your operating profit guidance for the full year? And at what point do you see more risk that it would be harder to get to that level? \nW. McMullen: Yes. I'll make a couple of comments, and then I'll let Gary fill in on the details. Some of the -- if you look at the positives, we had great expense control. The other thing I think is always important to remember is we sold the Turkey Hill Dairy business. We sold the c-store business during the first quarter, and we sold YouTech, all of which affected operating profit when you look at year-on-year in the first quarter. So I think it's important to remember that as well. And as I mentioned, the alternative profit exceeded expectations in the first quarter as well. With that, Gary, I'll let you fill in more of the details. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think that's a very important point you made around the adjustments to get the year-over-year comparison correct, Rodney, so thank you for raising those. I think beyond what you already shared, the key components I would add, we are obviously excited about where alternative profit is heading and still see that as a potential upside. I think the other piece that I mentioned in the prepared comments is our team has done a phenomenal job of looking for how do we continue to generate cost savings and efficiency in the business, and we still believe there are more levers that we are pulling and we'll continue to pull that give us the ability to make sure that we continue to strengthen the financial model as we're continuing to drive the sales momentum that Rodney described in his opening comments as well. So for us, I think it is really about making sure that we're connecting more strongly with the customer and driving sales, but certainly very focused on how do we make sure we're creating the most efficient operating model. And we continue to find additional opportunities, whether it's in store productivity, pharmacy productivity, as I mentioned earlier. We still think there's a lot of upside in goods not for resale and cost of goods. And so as we continue on this journey to make sure we're building the most efficient retail operation, we do believe there are levers that we can continue to pull throughout the year and into 2020. \nMichael Lasser: And then my follow-up question is on your price investment. Recognizing that there's been a lot of noise in your IDs over the last couple of quarters given the disruption from the store remodels, do you think your price investments are as effective as they might have been in the past? And if they are, will you have to reaccelerate your price investments in the coming quarters to drive higher IDs this year? \nW. McMullen: Yes. The -- one of the things that we always think is very important to remember is customers decide where to shop based on things more than just price, and we feel very good about where our price is relative to the market and relative to our competitors. And remember, customers also look at regional players when they're looking at their price as well. When you look at overall, the customer decides where to shop based on what's the experience they get from associates, what's the freshness of the fresh departments, and we've continued to rate strong in terms of -- if you look at produce, meat, seafood, delis, those areas of our business and the experience in terms of a great checkout experience and speed. And when you look at rewards, we do a fantastic job with rewards that are exclusive to each individual customer, where we use our data to make targeted offers based on that particular customer. And then, obviously, fuel is an important part of that overall equation. So the customer decides where to shop based on the overall experience, and we feel great, and we continue to make progress when you look at that total experience. And if you look at -- as I mentioned before, we had solid growth, strong growth in our loyal shoppers. \nOperator: The next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. \nKelly Bania: I had a couple of questions on operating profit. First, wanted to ask just about your 3-year plan. I didn't really see anything specific in the release about it, and I don't want to read too much into it. But can you comment on your thoughts on that $400 million plan? As you've pointed out in the past, I think The Street is skeptical of getting to that given the huge acceleration it implies next year. But maybe just could you comment on that? And then on your other comments about Turkey Hill and there's a lot of moving pieces between the Turkey Hill divestiture, the Home Chef acquisition and now with this real estate transaction. That was $57 million, I think. So that's about 14% of the $400 million plan that we weren't aware of. So can you help us understand these moving pieces, how much they add or subtract to that operating profit plan, so we can kind of model this out a little bit more clearly? \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. I think as you think about the Restock Kroger Plan, as you know, when we built the plan out, we've identified $4.45 billion of overall savings and value that we expected to create and then would invest $4.05 billion to support the business growth, whether that was in our associates or in pricing or the customer experience and digital capabilities. I would say as we look at where we are in the journey, we're feeling very good about the -- what we've learned through the process around where we unlock and how we create that $4.45 billion of value. As you've heard us talk about, alternative profit streams are right where we expected them to be, if anything, slightly ahead of plan at this point, and we see continued great upside for growth there. As we look at the cost savings, we obviously were successful in exceeding our plan last year at $1.1 billion of cost savings, and we are identifying, I would say, more cost savings as we are working through the plan this year that we believe can continue to accelerate our progress there in becoming a more efficient operator. I do think, as we've shared all the way along and Rodney has been consistent in his comments, that we do have to make sure that we are continuing to build momentum in sales. That's an important part in generating more leverage through the growth in sales that we're committed to achieve in the second half of this year and obviously into 2020. So I think as you pull those 3 pieces together, we still feel we have a very clear path to get there. And I would say in the levers that we intended to pull, where we are in the journey with those levers, we're feeling very confident around them. And as we continue to build momentum in the sales line that Rodney referenced, we're still committed to the $400 million of incremental FIFO operating profit. \nKelly Bania: And any comment on the Home Chef, Turkey Hill, the real estate, how those are part of the $400 million, the exact impact of those? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. The -- so we will probably do a little bit of calculation to make sure we're baselined in the right place against where the starting point was. So we were at $3.1 billion, if you recall, in '17, going to $3.5 billion. There maybe a couple of -- they're certainly not going to be drastically material in the impact they would have on the baseline, but there certainly will be a need for us to clarify what the baseline would be with the various changes that happened and what that then means to what $400 million means incrementally by 2020. We certainly don't contemplate, as we think about the run rate and the value that we'll be generating in 2020, that one-off transactions would be a major driver of the value that we expect to create. We've built the Restock Kroger plan with the mindset that it builds momentum into beyond 2020. We're not focused on getting to a specific number for 2020 that doesn't drive the value. \n The Home Chef certainly isn't in the $400 million, and the Turkey Hill sale gains certainly is included in there. So none of these one-off transactions are, that's why we've kind of stripped those out from the performance and what we've shared as our progress in the year. None of those, or in 2020 would we expect there to be individual asset sales or disposals that are going to create a gain that would be, if you like, filling the gap between where we are today and where we expect to be in 2020. \nKelly Bania: Okay. Maybe just a couple of follow-ups to that. I guess can you share with us where you see your FIFO operating profit with all the adjustments these, I guess, 5 quarters through the plan? And then in terms of alternative profit. So I think you said in the past, there was a 20% increase this year. Does that equate to the $100 million that you're now talking about? And can you remind us what the last year and next year is kind of planned at? \nW. McMullen: Well, on alternative profit in the quarter, the growth was -- last year, was 20%. This quarter would have been a little bit above 20%. And if you go back and look at '17, if I remember right, Gary, and you'll remember better than I would, I think it was 13% or so. So it's... \nGary Millerchip: Yes. \nW. McMullen: It's continuing to accelerate as we learn what to -- how to do it. And if you look at like the Media business, we've recruited professionals that know how to grow that business, so we're actually accelerating where we are. \n On the 5 quarters and stuff, I think we're probably -- would be better off for Gary and Rebekah to follow up to make sure that we get the specifics of the question so that we can help -- be a little bit more helpful than on the fly. \nGary Millerchip: Absolutely. \nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Prykull with Goldman Sachs. \nChristopher Prykull: So I guess, firstly, on the composition of gross margin, the change year-over-year and maybe the cadence for the rest of the year, a couple of components to that. So how much of the 40 basis point nonfuel decline can be attributed to pharmacy? Should we expect a similar headwind for the rest of the year? Will that improve? You mentioned alternative profits can be lumpy. Anything to keep in mind from a margin contribution seasonally? And then you're lapping some supply chain investments in the fourth quarter. I understand that. Any sense for mix shift towards Our Brands and the contribution there? \nW. McMullen: On the -- I'll start, and I'll let Gary finish. On the supply chain investments, in the first quarter, we continue to have significant start-up costs with facilities in Las Vegas, Michigan and Northern Kentucky that serves our online business. And the investment in the first quarter for those facilities was pretty similar to the fourth quarter in terms of an investment. Obviously, those facilities are in the middle of their ramp-up. \n If you look at Our Brands, as I always tell people, Our Brands margin typically is 600 to 800 basis points higher than national brand. Obviously, it's a higher sales part. And when you look at the gross margin per item, it's usually $0.01 or $0.02 higher on a cents-per-item profit basis. In terms of Rx and the balance of the year, Gary, I'll let you go into a little bit of the details there. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. So certainly, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, a meaningful part of the gross margin decline in the quarter was the gross margin pharmacy pressure you mentioned and also Kroger Specialty Pharmacy with its continued growth. Those 2, combined, would have been a meaningful portion of the reduction. We're feeling really good about the fact that we saw a significant deceleration in gross margin decline in Q1 versus the second half of the year. And as we guided to for the whole year, we do expect that to be the case. We don't expect to have another quarter like we had in Q3 and Q4 last year. That being said, obviously, we manage the business very dynamically. It's important that we're able to adapt on pricing, continue to invest where it makes sense and where the customer tell us they really value it, and it will drive retention and growth in our loyal customer base. So we tend to really focus on how we're managing the business to make sure that we're achieving the overall operating profit guidance and EPS that we shared. \n We do think there will continue to be some pressure in the Rx margin as the year progresses on. As I mentioned earlier, the team there is doing a very good job in making sure that we're finding ways to manage that pressure and also introduce cost-saving initiatives that balance out the impact of that. So we certainly would expect the impact to be less in the rest of the year as the team continues to execute on a plan to drive strong sales growth and drive improvements in overall profitability. \nW. McMullen: And alternative profit is always strongest in the fourth quarter because of the gift cards and the other related items. We have time for one more question. \nOperator: And that question will come from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. And Mr. Cerankosky dropped out -- dropped his line. \n The next question will be from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. \nMichael Montani: Just on the core gross margins for the grocery and consumable business, can you talk about what you saw after you back out some of the supply chain investments in the pharmacy? What are you seeing in the core there? And then the follow-up is on tonnage. Did you have growth there in the quarter given the 1% inflation, 1.5% comp? Just give us some color there incrementally on the trend, if you could. \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the tonnage on the equivalized units, it would have been continued growth. We continue to see customers going to buying bigger packs across the whole category. When you look at core gross margin, it would be a little bit of investment. But the -- as Gary mentioned, we had continued meaningful improvement in cost of goods through negotiation and other things, which funded quite a bit of investment as well. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? \nGary Millerchip: No. I think you said it well, Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Okay. Good. Thanks, Michael. \n Before we end today's call, one of the things that's exciting about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well. So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed to our associates and how all of us live our purpose every day. \n As America's grocer, Kroger takes seriously our role in celebrating our uniquely American heritage during the patriotic season between Memorial Day and Independence Day. It always makes me feel incredibly proud that Kroger employs so many men and women who have served or currently serve in the Armed Forces. I got a chance to personally live our purpose last Saturday with our Veterans Associate Resource Group who put on a 5K run to raise money for veterans. While I certainly didn't finish first and nowhere close to last either, I would like to add, in the race, I did have a different kind of first: touring a specifically designed tiny house that our caring associates dreamed up and then built for a deserving local veteran and his family. The home was built to green technology standards, made from recycled materials and features solar panels, demonstrating our associates' commitment to and passion for Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. In addition to the home, our Cincinnati/Dayton division donated a Kroger gift card and a bag of Our Brands products to turn a new tiny house into a home, and it really felt great. One of the many ways Kroger shows our gratitude and appreciation to all of our service members and their family is through our long-standing commitment to the USO. Kroger is the single-largest donor to the USO, contributing over $22 million over the past decade. In keeping with this commitment, we will be presenting the USO with $1 million donation and a Barbecue for the Troops event we are hosting at Fort Stewart in July. It is our honor and privilege as America's grocer to serve America's heroes. Thank you to all of our customers, associates and suppliers who make our business successful every day of the year. \n That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. \nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2019 result is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. \n We started the conversation with you last quarter by acknowledging that we had our work cut out for us. We are energized by that challenge, and our team brought that energy to the first quarter. There are several examples in the first quarter results that reflect the discipline, focus and progress we are making on our transformation plan: Restock Kroger. All of this work starts with our customer-obsession focus. That is why we're building an omnichannel platform to serve customers with Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. That is why we're focused on redefining the experience grocery customers can expect to have in our stores and online, improved upon by existing -- exciting partnerships that create additional value. That said, while the second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start, we know we can do better when it comes to our identical sales results. To that end, it's important that I say right up front that by further intensifying our customer focus, Kroger's quarter-to-date identical sales are trending better than the first quarter and moving toward the guidance range.\n One of our most powerful competitive advantages is also one of our best ongoing performers. Kroger's own brand products grew 3.3%, and unit share gained 66 basis points to reach 28.9% share in the quarter. The focus on shifting the mix to Simple Truth and premium brands, such as Private Selection, led to double-digit gains in the quarter in those brands. We know that our customers love Our Brands and that they are hungry for innovative new products that they can only get by coming to and shopping with Kroger. \n In our quest to put food first and serve as America's food authority, we are bringing new tastes, trends and experiences to our customers. In the first quarter, we introduced 219 fantastic Our Brands items. Our customers' favorite new items fall in line with the key food and flavor trends we predicted for 2019, including Private Selection pork belly bites, Private Selection artisan jerky and Kroger Deluxe Unicorn Swirl Ice Cream. New items delivered over $225 million in incremental sales during the first quarter.\n Customer obsession is also why we're building a platform to serve customers anything they want, anytime they want, and anywhere they want. Our customers don't distinguish between an in-store and online experience. Rather, they typically have a food-related need or a problem to solve and want the easiest, most seamless solution. Our digital sales grew 42% in the first quarter. We also expanded our coverage area to reach 93% of our customers in the first quarter. This means 93% of the customers who shop Kroger in a brick-and-mortar store also can shop with us for pickup or delivery. By the end of this year, everyone in America will have the ability through our modalities to shop with Kroger, whether they decide to come into a store, use our pickup or delivery services or ship. Our efforts are positioning Kroger to be the leading omnichannel retailer in the food industry. Since 2014, we've gone from no digital sales dollars to a 2018 annual run rate of about $5 billion, which will trend toward a $9 billion digital sales run rate in the future. I called this out because while we are only in the middle of our transformation, it's important to frame up the magnitude of the progress that we have made.\n 2019 is another pivotal year for our Partner for Customer Value pillar and Restock Kroger. We continue to improve the customer experience in our stores and across our digital properties by partnering with industry innovators such as Home Chef, Microsoft, Ocado and Walgreens. All of these partners accelerate our ability to provide customers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. Each partner shares our passion for exploring the nexus between technology and innovative customer experiences. \n We were excited to break ground last week in Ohio on America's first customer fulfillment center powered by Ocado. Kroger's partnership with Ocado will, for the first time, introduce transformative e-commerce fulfillment and logistics technology in America. This, in turn, means Kroger customers will get fresher food faster than ever before. We intend to open additional customer fulfillment facilities to create a seamless customer experience, replicating the model to serve everyone across America.\n We are also making progress building out our alternative business for profitable growth. We've made several organizational structural changes to allow deeper concentration on our alternative profit stream while also maintaining our laser focus on delivering for our customers in the core business. Kroger is creating a virtuous cycle, built upon the rich collection of proprietary data generated from our customer traffic, to improve the customer experience, which then supports new margin-rich, asset-light businesses. We expect alternative profit streams to continue to grow and contribute an estimated incremental $100 million in net operating profit in 2019 and continue to accelerate into 2020. This will be generated primarily from the more mature alternative profit streams such as Kroger Personal Finance, our Media businesses and customer data insights. \n There are other initiatives within our alternative business portfolio that are in earlier stages of incubation. For example, we recently announced the formation of PearlRock Partners, a platform to identify, invest in and help grow the next generation of leading consumer product brands. Initiatives such as PearlRock Partners are expected to have a small impact during Restock Kroger and then contribute more meaningfully to our results after 2020. Following up on our commitment we made in March to our financial stakeholders, Gary will provide additional transparency about where alternative profits will flow through our financial statements during his remarks.\n One of the challenges transforming a company is finding the right leaders at the right time to guide and coach people through complex and often difficult change. The underlying principle is to respect the company's past while creating the future. We've secured Kroger's continued success in the next chapter of retail by proactively managing several pivotable next-generation leadership successions, including the essential CFO and CIO roles. We've also focused several senior-most executive roles, most notably leaders of our new business development, including partnerships, and Kroger's alternative business portfolio to support the transformation of our growth model. Every leadership transition is deliberate, carefully managed and made in partnership with Kroger's Board of Directors. I'd like to again congratulate all of our new senior vice presidents and underscore my confidence in their ability to lead Kroger forward.\n Another important area of leadership for Kroger is in the environmental, social and governance areas, which is a natural extension of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan and is gaining recognition from a growing number of investors. As America's grocer, we are committed to setting the table for a sustainable future. A year ago, we took a deeper look on how plastic is affecting our communities and environment and became the first major U.S. retailer to announce the phaseout of single-use plastic grocery bags, starting with our QFC division in the Pacific Northwest. Earlier this month, Kroger announced our commitment to be the exclusive U.S. grocery retail partner for Loop. Loop is a new system that uses durable product packaging to help reduce single-use plastics. TerraCycle introduced Loop at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January to much fanfare and media interest. Many familiar suppliers and brands are included in the platform, and the list continues to expand. Loop hygienically cleans and sanitizes the empty packaging that was previously sold to the consumer and sends it back to the suppliers to refill for another use.\n Because the retail industry is transforming, we proactively launched Restock Kroger to deliver for customers and our shareholders. Plainly stated, Restock Kroger is all about transforming our growth model. The second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start. The entire company is focused on redefining the grocery customer experience, improving upon our exciting partnerships that create value. We are investing in our associates more than ever before and building a purpose-driven culture, and we are also on track to generate the free cash flow and incremental adjusted FIFO operating profit targets for 2019. As I said earlier, we recognize we have work to do and remain focused on delivering on our Restock Kroger commitments.\n Now I'd like to turn it over to Gary Millerchip, who's been in the CFO role since April. Gary? Thanks, Gary. We feel optimistic at the start of the second quarter. Sales momentum is building, and we are laser-focused on serving our customers. We are clear eyed about the challenges ahead and confident in our ability to deliver on our plans, both for the year and our long-term vision, to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. \n Now we look forward to your questions. Thanks, Robby. If you look at price investments overall, we're tracking really pretty consistent with where we expected it to be. We are continuing to cycle the investments we made during last year, so the flow-through of that will continue to be helpful. If you look at the '19 investments, it would be a reasonable amount. It will not be as much as what we did in '18 because, as you recall, when we had the tax law changes, we accelerated some of our '19 investments into '18 to give customers some of the value from the lower tax rate. \n When you look at the environment overall, there's always puts and takes. And overall, we would say it's pretty consistent with where it was before. We'll always see a specific area or category get more. But when you look it all in all, it looks pretty consistent with before. \n On accelerating the identicals, it really is -- one of the things on space optimization, now it's becoming a tailwind versus a headwind. Obviously, that's been -- has taken us longer than we expected, so that's been a positive. Just in terms of basic execution in the stores, our teams are doing a great job of improving the customer experience, which is adding momentum as well. And it's making sure that we use our data to target the right things to work on. So it's all of those things coming together and then being a little bit better at telling the customer our story. Inflation was higher in the first quarter than before but pretty consistent with expectations. When you look at the first quarter overall, sales were moving up nicely and continuing to make -- tracking as expected and making great progress up through Easter. Right after Easter, we hit a wall, and I always hate to use weather as an excuse for anything. But there's no doubt that when you look at the weather categories, we saw quite a bit of impact just because of -- if you look at Mother's Day, the things around Mother's Day and grilling out and all those things. As I mentioned, SNAP was a slight headwind but not a huge amount. When you look at it in total for the quarter, we continue to have great growth in loyal household growth. And if you look at spend per item, we saw people continuing to move upscale and continue to purchase bigger packs. And as I mentioned earlier, when we're looking at the second quarter so far, it's only 3 weeks, but we are moving closer to the '19 guidance. Yes. For us, we view it as additional partners helping CPGs to help them better spend their money. And when we really look at it, we're able to help CPGs to understand -- and you remember the old adage that half of my media is wasted, I just don't know which half. And our teams are able to do a great job on being able to help media companies understand where you spend money and what's the behavior of the customer. And we view the market as big enough to where there's plenty of opportunity for the market to grow overall and for the other companies that you referenced, for all of us to be successful, just because it's such a large market. So when we look at the opportunity, it's incredibly exciting. I know some of the early partners are really happy with the results, and we're just getting started. \n In terms of acquiring somebody, so far we've been able to partner with world-class companies to really accelerate our journey. Now whether that changes over time, I think it's to be determined. And, Ed, this is Rodney. If it was anything material, we would share it as well so that everybody would know. And as Gary mentioned, it's in the guidance. It really is, for us, to step up our game. And if you look at the customer experience, we've made significant improvement in some of the basic customer experience. What we find is there's a lag between when you make those improvements and when the customer starts rewarding you with their checkbook. And so part of the -- and this is using the data that we track every week, how are we doing in terms of the friendliness of our associates, in-stock and all of those pieces. And the progress that we've made is stronger than our progress in our identicals. The other part is some of the things I mentioned before, is just cycling space optimization and the other projects and getting a return from the remodels that we're doing and using the data in a continued, sophisticated way but even growing upon that as what we've had in the past. And tariffs from China has pretty minimal effect on us, and a lot of it can be managed. Tariffs from Mexico would be harder to manage. Hopefully, something works out there. As you know, overall, from a philosophy standpoint, we always believe that at the end of the day, tariffs just cause costs to go up for customers. And as I mentioned before, it's also the nice thing about having a multifaceted business where other things, the growth in our Own Brands and other things that I mentioned, in total, we still had great results. And also, as we look -- move forward, we see health and wellness as a huge opportunity in terms of from an alternative business standpoint and creating new partnerships to be able to help America live a healthier life. And as Gary mentioned, everything that we see, discussions with a lot of different health care providers, we increasingly see food as medicine. And if you look at our OptUP app and some of those things, we're able to help people eat healthier, and we see that as an opportunity even bigger in the future than it's been in the past. Yes. A great question, John, and it's something that we talk about, obviously, routinely. It was one of the reasons that we made some of the organizational changes that we made and moving alternative business to its own stand-alone area because we wanted to make sure that we had -- it's a huge opportunity -- we had dedicated people focused on it, and we didn't have people that were responsible for the daily interaction with the customer trying to do both. And one of the things I always like to --  for us to ask ourselves is, is it center of plate or corner of plate, [ corner of that ]? And if it's center, that's incredibly important. So I feel incredibly good about the people that we've put in place and making sure that the clarity is separating from all the pieces. \n We have recruited some external talent over the last several months to help us supplement the internal talent that we already had in terms of some of our operating areas, some of our vice presidents. And on our digital team, we've recruited a ton of talent from the outside to accelerate our digital journey. \n So it's -- to me, I think it's a great question. We spend a lot of energy on it. When you look at the operating side of the business, we have a lot of new people in role over the last couple of years. It always takes a little while for new talent to hit their stride, and I feel really good about how they're growing and the progress we're starting to make on the customer connection attributes. And it's starting to show up in loyal customer growth, so it's making progress. We feel really good about the talent we have in place, and we're starting to make some accelerated progress. Yes. It's still very, very early, and I would say the thing that has been incredibly positive is Walgreens, their team and their store teams are a fantastic partner. And both of us are learning things, the customer likes and dislikes, together, and we really see it as something that we continue to understand the customer desires and changes and adapting to that. And it's pretty early on. I know, Gary, you're much closer to it from a day-to-day basis, so I'll let you add some of the specific color. Yes. I'll make a couple of comments, and then I'll let Gary fill in on the details. Some of the -- if you look at the positives, we had great expense control. The other thing I think is always important to remember is we sold the Turkey Hill Dairy business. We sold the c-store business during the first quarter, and we sold YouTech, all of which affected operating profit when you look at year-on-year in the first quarter. So I think it's important to remember that as well. And as I mentioned, the alternative profit exceeded expectations in the first quarter as well. With that, Gary, I'll let you fill in more of the details. Yes. The -- one of the things that we always think is very important to remember is customers decide where to shop based on things more than just price, and we feel very good about where our price is relative to the market and relative to our competitors. And remember, customers also look at regional players when they're looking at their price as well. When you look at overall, the customer decides where to shop based on what's the experience they get from associates, what's the freshness of the fresh departments, and we've continued to rate strong in terms of -- if you look at produce, meat, seafood, delis, those areas of our business and the experience in terms of a great checkout experience and speed. And when you look at rewards, we do a fantastic job with rewards that are exclusive to each individual customer, where we use our data to make targeted offers based on that particular customer. And then, obviously, fuel is an important part of that overall equation. So the customer decides where to shop based on the overall experience, and we feel great, and we continue to make progress when you look at that total experience. And if you look at -- as I mentioned before, we had solid growth, strong growth in our loyal shoppers. Well, on alternative profit in the quarter, the growth was -- last year, was 20%. This quarter would have been a little bit above 20%. And if you go back and look at '17, if I remember right, Gary, and you'll remember better than I would, I think it was 13% or so. So it's... It's continuing to accelerate as we learn what to -- how to do it. And if you look at like the Media business, we've recruited professionals that know how to grow that business, so we're actually accelerating where we are. \n On the 5 quarters and stuff, I think we're probably -- would be better off for Gary and Rebekah to follow up to make sure that we get the specifics of the question so that we can help -- be a little bit more helpful than on the fly. On the -- I'll start, and I'll let Gary finish. On the supply chain investments, in the first quarter, we continue to have significant start-up costs with facilities in Las Vegas, Michigan and Northern Kentucky that serves our online business. And the investment in the first quarter for those facilities was pretty similar to the fourth quarter in terms of an investment. Obviously, those facilities are in the middle of their ramp-up. \n If you look at Our Brands, as I always tell people, Our Brands margin typically is 600 to 800 basis points higher than national brand. Obviously, it's a higher sales part. And when you look at the gross margin per item, it's usually $0.01 or $0.02 higher on a cents-per-item profit basis. In terms of Rx and the balance of the year, Gary, I'll let you go into a little bit of the details there. And alternative profit is always strongest in the fourth quarter because of the gift cards and the other related items. We have time for one more question. Yes. If you look at the tonnage on the equivalized units, it would have been continued growth. We continue to see customers going to buying bigger packs across the whole category. When you look at core gross margin, it would be a little bit of investment. But the -- as Gary mentioned, we had continued meaningful improvement in cost of goods through negotiation and other things, which funded quite a bit of investment as well. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? Okay. Good. Thanks, Michael. \n Before we end today's call, one of the things that's exciting about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well.

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strength and diversity of Kroger's multifaceted business model. Overall, we are leveraging Kroger's unique assets, our scale, unmatched customer data insights and our knowledge of food to build even stronger connections with our customers across all modalities: in store, pickup, delivery and ship.\n As Rodney discussed, we have a few headwinds during the first quarter, including sales, which we know must be stronger. We also experienced pharmacy gross margin pressure similar to others in the industry. Because of our multifaceted business model, we delivered an adjusted EPS result of $0.72 per diluted share. \n I'd like to highlight a few areas of our business that were particularly strong during the quarter. Our Brands contributed both as a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the first quarter and delivered on our Restock Kroger savings plan. And alternative profit businesses exceeded budget, setting us up to deliver our incremental operating profit target for 2019.\n On that note, last quarter, we committed to providing you with greater transparency on our alternative businesses and their contribution to Restock Kroger. As Rodney said at the top of the call, we expect alternative profits to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. You will see this growth reflected through the gross margin line of our financial statements.\n Certain amounts that we've traditionally recognized as reductions to OG&A expenses and merchandising costs are now being reflected as sales. This treatment more appropriately reflects the nature of these items and is consistent with others in the industry. In the first quarter, this affected identical sales by 3 basis points, and we have provided more detail in our 8-K filing. Please refer to Table 8 for a deeper explanation on the reclassification.\n Through the first quarter of 2019, alternative businesses are ahead of our expectations, with Media business and Kroger Personal Finance leading the way. We expect incremental operating profit growth to vary throughout the year, reflecting the continued acceleration of our Media business and the seasonality of certain businesses during peak holiday selling periods. For example, our gift card business is very seasonal, and therefore, growth will be most visible in respective quarters.\n Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 1.5% during the first quarter. The timing of SNAP disbursement negatively affected results by 15 basis points. Several departments outperformed the company in the quarter, including key beverage categories, pet, natural foods, and we had another strong quarter from our pharmacy business. \n We recognize that getting into our identical sales guidance range will require an acceleration of identical sales throughout the rest of our fiscal year. We are diligently working to improve performance and build on the positive identical sales trend momentum we are seeing thus far in our second quarter. Additionally, as we move through the second quarter, we will begin to cycle investments made during the same period last year, which we expect to be a tailwind. \n Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the first quarter was $957 million and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin was 22.2% of sales for the first quarter, and FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 40 basis points from the same period last year, primarily due to industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy. This represents a sequential improvement in the level of margin investments compared to the second half of 2018. The LIFO charge for the quarter was $15 million. Our associates have done an amazing job managing shrink, which improved during the first quarter compared to the prior year. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of shrink rate improvement. OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and 2019 and 2018 first quarter adjustment items, decreased 12 basis points. This quarter's decrease is primarily due to the execution of Restock Kroger initiatives and planned real estate transactions. And by planned, I mean these transactions were contemplated in our EPS guidance for the year. Our results highlight the continued progress we are making with the Restock Kroger savings program, building on the $1.1 billion of savings and benefits achieved in our prior fiscal year. We are committed to continuing to find additional improvements and efficiencies in our business. \n Retail fuel profit growth was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but we still expect fuel operating profit to be a headwind overall in 2019, particularly in the second half of the year. Our cents-per-gallon fuel margin in the first quarter was $0.23 compared to $0.18 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.62 versus $2.63 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, especially among our most loyal households. We continue to increase our investment in fuel rewards and saw positive gallon growth with our loyal customers in the first quarter. \n Turning now to talent development. We are supporting associates in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger. Today, I'm pleased to share our recently updated average hourly rate is over $20 per hour with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. The most recent example of our investments in wages was our Monday announcement of a newly ratified labor contract covering store associates in Indianapolis. The ratified agreement with UFCW Local 700 raises starting wages for most clerks, and associates will receive regular wage increases every 6 months. This is part of our continued effort to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training.\n We are also very energized by the significant interest we're seeing from associates in Feed Your Future, our industry-leading education assistance program launched just over a year ago. Feed Your Future is available to all associates, full or part-time, after 6 months of service. Among all the participants, more than 80% are hourly store associates. As a result of our investments in talent development, we are significantly improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. \n In addition to the new labor agreement covering Kroger associates in Indianapolis, we also ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering King Soopers associates in Denver and Kroger associates in Louisville, Kentucky, during the first quarter. We are currently negotiating with UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland, Seattle and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefits package relevant to today's associates. \n Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\n A key component of Restock Kroger is generating strong free cash flow. Our financial strategy is to use free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash to achieve these goals. We reduced net total debt by $1.7 billion during -- since the end of fiscal year 2018. Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio is 2.54, down from 2.83 at the end of 2018. The company's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5. We have prioritized getting our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio back into the target range and use proceeds from the sale of YouTechnology and the Turkey Hill Dairy business to help us do so.\n I'd like to take a few moments to talk a little bit more about YouTech. This is a great example of how Kroger leveraged the unique assets I mentioned earlier to create significant value for our shareholders. We acquired the business for a nominal value several years ago and developed it into a market leader in digital coupons. When the business reached a point where the potential value to someone else was higher than the future value to Kroger, we sold the business to maximize shareholder return. As part of the terms of the sale, we protected the value to Kroger through a long-term service agreement with Inmar. YouTech is a great illustration of how we are leveraging our unique assets to create new asset-light, margin-rich businesses to drive incremental value for our shareholders. \n Before I turn it back to Rodney, I'd like to discuss an accounting change that affects our financial reporting and reiterate our guidance for 2019. You may have noticed in our 8-K filing that we adopted the new leasing standard at the beginning of the fiscal year. This added nearly $7 billion of lease-related assets and liabilities to our balance sheet. The rating agencies already calculate and include our liability for operating leases in their ratings assessments, and this new standard is not expected to affect rent expense or earnings for the year. \n Finally, I would like to reiterate our guidance for the year. For 2019, identical sales growth, excluding fuel, we continue to target identical rates that range from 2% to 2.25%. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. Kroger's EPS growth will come from adjusted FIFO operating profit growth in 2019, which positions us well to deliver on Restock Kroger. \n Rodney, back to you. Rodney, the only thing I would add... So I think the question was asked around digital, too, as part of the overall performance, and we continue to see strong results, and certainly in line with what we expected during the first quarter from the way customers are engaging through the seamless digital experience that we're creating, both in terms of ordering online to pick up at the store and also ordering online to ship to home or deliver to home. Jeff, it's Gary. That's right, Ed. We -- as we mentioned in the prepared notes, we actually had this transaction planned as part of the guidance for the year and part of our business plan. I think you're aware, but real estate has always been part of our overall strategy as to how do we make the best use and leverage the assets that we have available to us and that we're creating as we build out a store around a shopping center and as we start to really make the most of being that anchor tenant in many of the places that we operate. So for many years, we've had real estate transactions in our results. Often, they can be some losses as well as gains sometimes during those quarters. We felt that this quarter, because it was a bigger amount than it would normally be, it was important that we were transparent, especially as obviously it helped the OG&A rate to look better overall in the quarter because of that onetime transaction. But it was absolutely contemplated, and it was part of our expectations actually in the first quarter as well. I think we are always obviously looking at opportunities and especially where it can help our free cash flow and where we can arbitrage the profitability of the real estate that we own currently. So I wouldn't get into specific details around any of the overall plans that we have, but we do certainly look for those opportunities where they exist, but they're not contemplated within the guidance that we shared. Sure. I'd be happy to talk about that. So as you know, when we talked about our guidance for the year, our expectation was that we'd see inflation in the range of 0% to 1%. That was what we've built our plan around. And I would say if you look at Q1 results and exclude pharmacy and fuel from the calculation, we would be at the top end of that range. Certainly, as we are seeing those cost increases come through, we have a very robust process within our cost of goods team to really look at ways in which we can mitigate those cost increases and ensure that we're able to maintain profitability in the business. Where we are seeing the legitimate reason for those costs coming through, we are generally being successful in passing them on to the customer through the pricing strategy. And I would say that's generally what we saw during the first quarter and would be our strategy during the rest of the year. One of the things that obviously we feel is an important advantage for us is the significant market share that we have with our own brand products, and so ensuring that we're using that to really manage and balance as we see price increases come through. And of course, it's a great set of knowledge for us knowing what the true cost of product is and how to effectively manage those cost increases. I think our outlook... No. I was just going to say I think our outlook for the year, in general, would be in the -- would be similar to what we've been experiencing, except for, of course, some of the challenges and uncertainties that are being created by some discussion on some potential trade impacts and obviously some things like the swine flu that was also out there. So there are obviously 1 or 2 items that we're watching very closely because they have the potential to impact inflation in a more meaningful way. Sure. First of all, I'd like to just maybe give a little bit more context on our pharmacy business, too, because it's certainly a very important part of our business. It drives a lot of loyalty overall with the customer, and we continue to get extremely strong customer satisfaction ratings. It's a part of our business that generally is continuing to grow script counts and grow sales very strongly, as we mentioned, during the quarter. And it ties very closely for us to our health and wellness strategy. And as we start to think about food as medicine, we think it's a very important connection. \n The business today is profitable for us and generates a high ROIC. But as you mentioned, we are certainly seeing some pressure in the industry. There's a couple of things at play, really, within the gross margin pressure that we saw in Q1 which, as I mentioned, wouldn't be unique to us. The first is there is a generic supply challenge, and therefore the cost of supplying product has gone up significantly. And secondly, as we've renegotiated our PPM agreements, 3 of the big ones going through the renegotiation process, there's an increase in costs there that's also placing some pressure on gross margin. That being said, our pharmacy team has been extremely proactive in developing plans to mitigate that, both from how do we buy most effectively but also how do we create more efficiency in the pharmacy business. And we continue to see significant efficiency improvements in the cost to fill a pharmacy order, and our pharmacy team are doing a really nice job of finding ways to offset some of those pressures. Yes. Sure. I think that some of the things that we're learning and we like so far, John, with what we're seeing, first of all, by having the level of convenience now that we have with those 13 stores in Northern Kentucky, alongside 10 of our own stores with the pickup service, we're getting great feedback on both the fact that we're even a different level of convenience than we were before. And this ability to get in and out really quickly is certainly something that is resonating very well with the customers that are using the service. We're also starting to see some positive feedback from customers around the speed of in and out for those small shopping trips and the ability to be able to get what I need for today and what I need for tonight, whether it's for lunch or dinner, and that's certainly a real positive. What we find generally with the small-format stores, there is a ramp-up as customers become more comfortable with their shopping behavior. We've seen that with our own small-format stores, and we've seen it over the years with convenience stores. So the biggest thing for us now is really poring over the data and making sure that we're using a data-driven approach to continue to enhance the service and the experience. Yes. I think that's a very important point you made around the adjustments to get the year-over-year comparison correct, Rodney, so thank you for raising those. I think beyond what you already shared, the key components I would add, we are obviously excited about where alternative profit is heading and still see that as a potential upside. I think the other piece that I mentioned in the prepared comments is our team has done a phenomenal job of looking for how do we continue to generate cost savings and efficiency in the business, and we still believe there are more levers that we are pulling and we'll continue to pull that give us the ability to make sure that we continue to strengthen the financial model as we're continuing to drive the sales momentum that Rodney described in his opening comments as well. So for us, I think it is really about making sure that we're connecting more strongly with the customer and driving sales, but certainly very focused on how do we make sure we're creating the most efficient operating model. And we continue to find additional opportunities, whether it's in store productivity, pharmacy productivity, as I mentioned earlier. We still think there's a lot of upside in goods not for resale and cost of goods. And so as we continue on this journey to make sure we're building the most efficient retail operation, we do believe there are levers that we can continue to pull throughout the year and into 2020. Sure. Yes. I think as you think about the Restock Kroger Plan, as you know, when we built the plan out, we've identified $4.45 billion of overall savings and value that we expected to create and then would invest $4.05 billion to support the business growth, whether that was in our associates or in pricing or the customer experience and digital capabilities. I would say as we look at where we are in the journey, we're feeling very good about the -- what we've learned through the process around where we unlock and how we create that $4.45 billion of value. As you've heard us talk about, alternative profit streams are right where we expected them to be, if anything, slightly ahead of plan at this point, and we see continued great upside for growth there. As we look at the cost savings, we obviously were successful in exceeding our plan last year at $1.1 billion of cost savings, and we are identifying, I would say, more cost savings as we are working through the plan this year that we believe can continue to accelerate our progress there in becoming a more efficient operator. I do think, as we've shared all the way along and Rodney has been consistent in his comments, that we do have to make sure that we are continuing to build momentum in sales. That's an important part in generating more leverage through the growth in sales that we're committed to achieve in the second half of this year and obviously into 2020. So I think as you pull those 3 pieces together, we still feel we have a very clear path to get there. And I would say in the levers that we intended to pull, where we are in the journey with those levers, we're feeling very confident around them. And as we continue to build momentum in the sales line that Rodney referenced, we're still committed to the $400 million of incremental FIFO operating profit. Yes. The -- so we will probably do a little bit of calculation to make sure we're baselined in the right place against where the starting point was. So we were at $3.1 billion, if you recall, in '17, going to $3.5 billion. There maybe a couple of -- they're certainly not going to be drastically material in the impact they would have on the baseline, but there certainly will be a need for us to clarify what the baseline would be with the various changes that happened and what that then means to what $400 million means incrementally by 2020. We certainly don't contemplate, as we think about the run rate and the value that we'll be generating in 2020, that one-off transactions would be a major driver of the value that we expect to create. We've built the Restock Kroger plan with the mindset that it builds momentum into beyond 2020. We're not focused on getting to a specific number for 2020 that doesn't drive the value. \n The Home Chef certainly isn't in the $400 million, and the Turkey Hill sale gains certainly is included in there. So none of these one-off transactions are, that's why we've kind of stripped those out from the performance and what we've shared as our progress in the year. None of those, or in 2020 would we expect there to be individual asset sales or disposals that are going to create a gain that would be, if you like, filling the gap between where we are today and where we expect to be in 2020. Yes. Absolutely. Yes. So certainly, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, a meaningful part of the gross margin decline in the quarter was the gross margin pharmacy pressure you mentioned and also Kroger Specialty Pharmacy with its continued growth. Those 2, combined, would have been a meaningful portion of the reduction. We're feeling really good about the fact that we saw a significant deceleration in gross margin decline in Q1 versus the second half of the year. And as we guided to for the whole year, we do expect that to be the case. We don't expect to have another quarter like we had in Q3 and Q4 last year. That being said, obviously, we manage the business very dynamically. It's important that we're able to adapt on pricing, continue to invest where it makes sense and where the customer tell us they really value it, and it will drive retention and growth in our loyal customer base. So we tend to really focus on how we're managing the business to make sure that we're achieving the overall operating profit guidance and EPS that we shared. \n We do think there will continue to be some pressure in the Rx margin as the year progresses on. As I mentioned earlier, the team there is doing a very good job in making sure that we're finding ways to manage that pressure and also introduce cost-saving initiatives that balance out the impact of that. So we certainly would expect the impact to be less in the rest of the year as the team continues to execute on a plan to drive strong sales growth and drive improvements in overall profitability. No. I think you said it well, Rodney."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. \n Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary.\n I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's third quarter 2020 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. \n When restrictions were set in place to address the spread of COVID-19 in mid-March, many underestimated the length of time that it would last and the number of families and communities that would be impacted. Many of the stories from the last 9 months have been upsetting, to say the least. Out of this grief, we've also seen the best parts of human nature. From our store teams to our warehouse associates and drivers and our digital teams, plants and offices, our Kroger family of associates have been nothing short of incredible during this period. I am proud of our dedicated associates who have continued to diligently execute our Restock Kroger transformation while serving our customers when they need us most.\n We delivered strong results in the third quarter. Customers are at the center of everything we do and sales remain elevated, and we continue to grow market share as we enhance our competitive moats, Fresh, Our Brands, Data & Personalization and Seamless. I want to highlight that Kroger's digital sales are incrementally profitable today, partly supported by our rapidly growing digital media business and partially fueled by our constant improvement in operational efficiency. This is true as an incremental pass-through rate of sales, and we have a clear path to continue improving digital profitability. Gary will touch on this more in a few minutes, but I wanted to call this out as well because it demonstrates the strength of not only our Seamless offering, but the overall Kroger ecosystem and how the components parts fit together to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders.\n We are more certain than ever that the strategic choices and investments made over the last 3 years have positioned us to meet the moment. And as a result of our strong performance and consistent market share gains, we are raising our guidance for the remainder of the year. We are also positioned to deliver beyond 2020 for our customers, associates and shareholders as we believe a number of the impacts of COVID-19 will be structural and lasting.\n As a result of the pandemic, we continue to see increased basket sizes and fewer customer visits. Customers across the country are still staying home and cooking at home is now part of the new routine. We are fulfilling our customers' growing demand for premium products as they seek joy and elevated experiences. We're merchandising in new ways to both meet that demand and inspire our customers to trade up to items like premium jumbo blueberries, and by the way, they're delicious, and larger-sized packages of strawberries, raspberries and grapes.\n Home Chef's culinary innovation is inspiring customers with new oven-ready entr\u00e9es and sides, flat bread, pizzas, salads and sandwiches. In the Fresh soup category, we have introduced new flavorful and delicious Simple Truth and Home Chef varieties. Our efforts are also driving strong market share gain in -- growth in packaged produce, fresh prepared foods and specialty cheese.\n This is also where our brands really shine. Our multi-tiered brand portfolio positions us well to deliver against our customers' diverse needs and desires. Our Brand grew at 8.6% in the third quarter, and we grew market share. Private Selection grew over 17% and Simple Truth grew nearly 15%. These are incredible numbers and demonstrate that while many competitors offer private label products, Kroger's unique approach to Our Brands is a differentiator in a competitive moat. \n By leveraging our unique data and customer insights, we continue to be at the forefront of product innovation and new product development. During the third quarter, we launched 250 new items, the most ever in a single quarter. New items for the quarter included launches in trending focus areas such as fresh produce, frozen grocery and expansion of our Simple Truth plant-based collection, unveiling more than 50 new fresh and flavorful plant-based foods at affordable prices.\n Moving now to our third competitive moat, Data & Personalization. Many retailers have transactional data, but no one has the customer data and the insights that Kroger has. The quality of our data is a massive advantage because it allows us to develop a significant alternative profit business that generates income from the traffic while benefiting our customers. Our personalization efforts motivate our customers to continue to show interest in Kroger's communications, where nearly 80% have asked to receive relevant information and offers from us. \n Our customer e-mail open rate is nearly 18% higher than the industry average, which illustrates our ability to offer relevant content and offers to our customers. We continue to advance our personalization technology. About 95% of customer interactions with product on our website and app are enabled by personalization, driving a significantly higher level of engagement in our offers and nearly doubling the likelihood of adding an item to a cart.\n Our store's competitive moat is Seamless. Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As part of our journey, we have been evolving our fulfillment network. First, taking advantage of our existing assets, our physical stores, providing flexibility and proximity to our customers with broad and relevant assortment to meet their needs. Second, expanding our network of assets and capabilities with a portfolio of various-sized facilities optimized based on volume, demand profile and density, leveraging scale and automation to meet the rapidly changing customer needs.\n Our early investments lay the foundation, including over 2,200 pickup locations and over 2,450 delivery locations, which allowed us to capture the increased customer demand for e-commerce offerings during the pandemic we have today, reaching 98% of our customers with a seamless customer experience around in-store shopping, pickup, delivery and ship-to-home modalities. \n We are innovating and building out a flexible network of fulfillment options and working with key solutions providers. As we recently announced, we continue to progress on our Ocado facilities program with plans to build customer fulfillment centers in Michigan and in the south region of the country. The upcoming opening of our first 2 fulfillment centers in early 2021 in Monroe, Ohio and Groveland, Florida in collaboration to leverage some of their in-store fulfillment capabilities. \n We work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure in the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. We are focused on both developing, training and promoting internal talent and hiring external industry executives, which together drives our retail supermarket business as well as our other businesses. \n Kroger has been investing to raise the wages of our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, over the period of 2018 to 2020, Kroger will have invested an incremental $800 million per year in associate wage increases. As we've noted before, this is $300 million more than the original planned investment. As a result of our continued focus on growing associate wages, Kroger has increased its average wage rate to over $20 per hour with our comprehensive and best-in-class benefits, including health care, paid time off and retirement included. \n As the largest grocery retailer in America, Kroger is committed to being a force for good in the communities we serve. Our purpose to feed the human spirit continues to guide how we operate our business, care for our communities and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Since launching our ambitious Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan in 2017, we achieved our goal to donate more than 1 billion meals to feed hungry families in our communities by 2020. We also continue to increase Kroger's diversion of waste from landfill, reaching 80% diversion last year on our path to achieve 90% diversion or Zero Waste. This year, Kroger outlined several new long-term environmental commitments and they can be found in our annual environmental, social and governance report. \n Last month, we were proud to be included among the world's sustainability leaders, recognized by our inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the eighth year in a row. We are committed to continuing to integrate ESG metrics into our business strategy, driving shared value for our associates, customers, communities and shareholders. \n Since March, we have invested nearly $1.3 billion to both reward our associates and to protect our associates and customers through the implementation of dozens of safety measures like installing protective partitions and physical distancing floor decals. We continue to require masks and limit the number of people in our stores to allow for physical distancing and ensure frequent and proper cleaning procedures are followed. We also promote additional ways to shop using pickup or no-contact delivery. Our total COVID-19 incident rate continues to track below the rate in the surrounding communities where we operate. \n Our supply chain remains strong and healthy, and we are replenishing our stores daily so that the supplies and products our customers need are readily available. To ensure our customers have access to what they need, we have proactively secured an additional 5,000 truckloads of inventory and increased distribution capacity reserves by 20% within our supply chain to get ahead and avoid potential supply disruptions.\n Furthermore, we have flexed our national footprint by dynamically shifting volume from constrained facilities and regions to facilities and regions with available capacity to accommodate. As America's grocer, we continue to see the unique opportunity to be part of our customers' healthy journey in addition to being their grocer of choice. Throughout the pandemic, we have remained committed to helping people live healthier lives by offering in-clinic and at-home COVID-19 testing solutions, supported by our team of experienced health care professionals. \n The size and scale of our health care footprint with over 2,200 pharmacies and 220 clinics in 35 states provide us the unique ability to efficiently facilitate COVID-19 testing and immunize a large portion of the U.S. population once vaccines become available. Kroger Health has conducted over 250,000 COVID-19 tests since April and has recently launched rapid antibody tests, which are now available across our family of pharmacies and clinics. \n We are also partners in the federal -- with the federal government effort to deliver hundreds of millions of potentially life-saving vaccines to our communities. We have also partnered with dozens of state health departments in preparation for the other early administration of vaccines to priority populations. Once an FDA-authorized vaccine is available, we're committed to making it accessible in accordance with the federal rollout plan. All our pharmacies and clinics are staffed with professionals, licensed pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and technicians. \n Health and wellness is a critical part of our customer value proposition. Pharmacy customers are more loyal, spending 3x more per customer. We have approached pharmacy from an omnichannel perspective for quite some time, allowing customers to choose the most appropriate channel in which to connect with us, whether that be in-store, on the phone or online. For all channels, our strategy is consistent: simplify health care by creating solutions that combine health, wellness and nutrition. I continue to be proud of the work that our associates do to serve each other, our customers and our communities. Stories of their accomplishments and selflessness inspire me every day. The investments we have made to enhance our competitive moats are paying off and as a result, we are growing market share.\n I will now turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. The Kroger team delivered strong results in the third quarter and provided a further proof point of the value creation model we shared at our Investor Day last year. We grew market share and, consistent with our value creation model, were disciplined in balancing significant investments in our customers and our associates with improved productivity and accelerated growth in our alternative profit businesses. The investments we are making in our business are allowing us to deliver strong results today and, importantly, are also setting us up to deliver sustained growth in the future. \n I'll now provide more color on our third quarter results. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.71 per diluted share, up 51% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 10.9% during the third quarter and continued to gain market share. Our identical sales growth increase was broad-based and all departments, excluding fuel, achieved positive growth over the prior year. Meat and produce departments led the way, continuing to underscore the importance of Fresh and how we differentiate in quality and assortment for our customers. \n Digital sales grew 108% in the third quarter and contributed approximately 4.6% to identical sales without fuel. Customer engagement with our digital solutions is driving overall loyalty. When customers engage with both our physical stores and digital channels, they visit more frequently and, on average, spend twice as much as those who shop in store only. The vast majority of our digital customers are shopping in-store as well as online. We are, therefore, confident that the seamless experience we are building across our store and digital ecosystem position us well for continued growth in a post-COVID world.\n At the same time, digital sales growth in the quarter was profitable on an incremental basis, and we continue to improve digital profitability by lowering the cost to fulfill a pickup order and accelerating digital advertising revenue. As Rodney noted, we see a clear path to further improve digital profitability by leveraging our personalization tools to increase basket size and improve sales mix, further reduce the cost to fulfill an order via process improvements and automation, and continue to grow digital media revenue.\n We are also excited about the value our merger with Home Chef has brought to our digital capabilities, both in terms of the extended meal solutions offered for our customers and the significant sales growth and profitability improvements the business is achieving. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the third quarter was $871 million, up 33% compared to the third quarter of 2019. We were pleased with our ability to consistently pass-through the benefits of elevated sales in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations and guidance previously shared.\n Gross margin was 23% of sales in the third quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. We achieved improvements in gross margin during the quarter through sourcing efficiencies, sales leverage and growth in alternative profit streams. These tailwinds were offset by changes in the sales mix as a result of COVID-19 and continued investments to deliver greater value for our customers, ensuring we sustain long-term customer loyalty and position the business for success in 2021 and beyond. \n The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 30 basis points. This reflects sales leverage and strong cost control through execution of Restock Kroger initiatives, which more than offset continued COVID-19-related investments to protect the health and safety of our associates, customers and communities and increased incentive costs. We were pleased with progress on our Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives in the quarter and continue to be on track to achieve the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020.\n As an example, through the implementation of multiple process and technology improvements this year, we have been able to reduce the cost to fulfill a pickup order in-store by double digits compared to the same period last year, while at the same time improving the customer experience by significantly reducing customer wait times. Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. Consistent with market trends, our decline in gallons in the third quarter slowed to around 13%. We remain well positioned within our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and our market-leading reward program. The average retail price of fuel was $2.15 this quarter versus $2.62 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the third quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.30 in the same quarter last year. \n Kroger's alternative profit businesses are built on a platform that leverages our supermarket traffic and data. Our alternative profit businesses had a very strong third quarter, led by tremendous growth in our digital media business, Kroger Precision Marketing. On the strength of growth in digital sales, digital customer engagement and new inventory, KPM achieved revenue growth of over 190%. Over 1,200 brands are now engaging with KPM as a better way to invest marketing dollars that were previously being spent with advertising platforms and digital media companies. \n CPG brands continue to leverage our audience intelligence for more effective brand building activations that are achieving better return on ad spend. Thanks to our team's nimbleness and responding to the challenges presented by COVID, our alternative profit businesses are performing well, and we now expect profit growth to exceed $100 million for the fiscal year 2020.\n We continue to believe alternative profit will be a major accelerator of our model in the future and COVID-19 has not changed the long-term profit expectations previously shared as part of Restock Kroger. We continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. As you know, for the last decade or more, Kroger has sought opportunities to address the funding challenges facing the multi-employer pension plans in which many of our associates participate.\n We believe charges related to pension funding can be mitigated if plans are reviewed and addressed over time. In July, we announced a tentative agreement to improve security for future retirement benefits of over 33,000 Kroger family of company associates across 20 local UFCW unions with a pretax investment of nearly $1 billion that will be satisfied by installment payments over the next 3 years. I'm pleased to say that, that agreement is now being ratified by participating union locals and Kroger will incur a charge to net earnings during the fourth quarter of approximately $0.98 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. This does not affect adjusted net earnings per diluted share results for 2020, which are provided on a basis that excludes adjustment items such as this contribution. \n We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Las Vegas and Dallas during the third quarter. Last week, we ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering associates in West Virginia, and we are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Little Rock, Houston and Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhanced job security for our associates.\n Turning now to financial strategy. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to our previously communicated capital allocation framework. We are continuing to invest in the business to drive profitable growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and the growing dividend over time. We now expect total capital expenditures to range between $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion in 2020. This lower range is primarily due to the expected delay in when spend will occur as a result of COVID-19. We are being disciplined in how we deploy capital to ensure that our investments will deliver strong returns, and we continue to see many opportunities to invest in the business to support sustainable long-term revenue and profit growth consistent with our CSR goals. \n Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.74 compared to 2.5 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strong liquidity reflects our elevated operating performance and significant improvements in working capital. This improvement in working capital includes the impact of temporary increase in warehousing and buildup of inventory during the third quarter that Rodney referenced earlier, which we implemented to minimize supply disruptions as a result of higher COVID cases forecast over the winter months.\n During the quarter, Kroger repurchased $304 million of shares under its $1 billion board authorization announced on September 11, 2020. Year-to-date, Kroger has now repurchased $989 million of shares. In June, Kroger increased the dividend by 13%, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases.\n Finally, I'd like to provide additional color on our guidance for the remainder of 2020. As we shared previously, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the outlook for food retail, and we continue to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. As a result of our continued strong sales and market share performance and the expectation of sustained trends in food at home consumption for the remainder of our fiscal year, we are raising our full year 2020 guidance. \n For the full year 2020, we now expect total identical sales without fuel to be around 14%. We expect to achieve adjusted EPS growth of approximately 50% to 53%, and adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. Our guidance contemplates continued investments in the customer and ongoing COVID-19-related costs to protect the safety of our customers and associates, balanced with continued execution of cost-saving initiatives and growth in alternative profits.\n Looking towards 2021, we believe that our performance will be stronger than we would have expected prior to the pandemic when viewed as a 2-year stacked result for identical sales without fuel growth and as a compounded growth rate over 2020 and 2021 for adjusted earnings per share growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to achieve consistently attractive total shareholder returns. We look forward to providing detailed guidance for 2021 and updating you on our road map to deliver long-term growth in March next year. \n And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, Gary. We are executing against our strategy even during the pandemic and continue to grow market share. The strong underlying momentum in our core supermarket business and acceleration in the growth of our alternative profit business demonstrates that we are successfully transforming our business model to deliver consistently strong and attractive total shareholder return in 2020 and beyond. \n Now we look forward to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I wanted to ask around e-commerce. It doesn't look like it's getting an explicit call out as a headwind, even though it's sort of doubled in terms of sales. So can I ask you where it's showing up in the P&L? And then a bigger question, presumably sales will normalize a bit in '21, but we think -- or I don't know if you think digital will still be elevated, so how does that manifest itself in the P&L for next year? \nW. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Simeon, for the question. If you look at e-commerce, as Gary and I both mentioned, incrementally, it is profitable this quarter on the incremental growth, and it was driven by the continued improvement in reducing the costs to serve our digital customer and the incremental growth in media. And as both of us mentioned, we would expect to continue to make progress on both of those fronts. \n As you look to 2021, we expect -- obviously, the digital growth won't be as much as it was in 2020, but we would expect for the customer to continue to expect and want digital service. But the thing that, to me, is inspiring and great to see is customers that are digital shoppers generally still continue to come into the store to use -- to have an in-store experience when they want to. And that customer basically spends double what they spend if they don't.\n So we really like the overall Seamless omnichannel experience that we're delivering and creating for the customer. And we would expect, as we continue going forward, that we'll continue to make progress on the profitability of that digital shopper. And then obviously, once you get past the start-up cost of Ocado and some of the micro fulfillment centers, things like that, that is significantly even lower cost than serving the customer in the store. So when we really look at all the pieces together, we love the progress we're making and we're excited about the continued progress we expect to make. \n We -- everything we can see, we think the pandemic has accelerated the growth or transition to digital probably by 3 years or so. It wouldn't surprise me if it dropped off a smidgen, but I think it will continue to grow from that because it is a long-term trend where a customer really expects to be able to get something in-store, pickup or delivery, and they expect to be able to bounce back and forth based on what's easy for them. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? \nGary Millerchip: Well, I agree completely, Rodney, with your overall comments. Maybe a couple of specifics, I mean, into 2020 and 2021, just to build on some of Rodney's comments. First of all, as you think about 2020, we talked about the pass-through rates, obviously being lower on digital although being incrementally positive. So the way it would show up in our P&L is where typically on the sales growth that we're seeing this year. We might have normally seen a pass-through rate of north of 15% on a traditional brick-and-mortar sale. The blended rate between digital and store and having in the COVID cost may be coming in around 10% versus that 15% or higher. So a combination of lower pass-through rate on digital and the incremental COVID cost will be bringing down that overall blended rate. \n Interestingly, though, on a specific example, as you know, we took away the fee on a promotional basis during the quarter. So that would be a headwind to gross margin. But actually, the value that we're creating through media revenue is really offsetting that. So we've been able to invest in the customer while still being able to replace that revenue by offering personalized digital communications to customers that drive new revenue streams to offset that promotional activity. \n As you think about 2021, just one sort of -- I guess, an unusual phenomenon just to think through it, but the more improvements we make now on our digital business as we're continuing to improve digital profitability, so as we take cost out of the cost fulfillment order, as we grow the average order value through personalization, as we grow media revenue, that -- those tailwinds will be -- if we achieve them in Q3 this year, we'll get the full benefit on the whole volume next year. So actually on the same level of business, digital would be a tailwind in next year's financial model. Now obviously, as digital continues to grow, it will create some additional investment next year. But on the base level of business that we're generating in 2020 as you create the full benefit from those cost savings from media revenue, it will become a tailwind on that base level business next year in terms of improving profitability of digital. \nSimeon Gutman: Maybe just one follow-up, and I think Rodney mentioned also micro fulfillment will help over time. Just to clarify, the pickup that you're doing for click-and-collect or pick-up orders, all the pickup is being done by in-house employees and I think that's pressure in the SG&A line. The Instacart and the third-party partnerships, where does that show up in the P&L? Do any of your employees actually pick for Instacart? And then, big picture, the economics with some of these third parties, I guess, where is the pricing power? Is there pricing power with you with some of those partners? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Simeon, you'd be correct in the way in which our core pickup business would show up in our P&L as a lower pass-through rate is the labor associated with picking the product in the store. That's what drives the mid-single-digit pass-through rate versus the sort of high-teen rate, if you like, on a traditional brick-and-mortar sale. We have a fairly unique model, I think, with Instacart. They are our predominant partner. We do use other partners as well in terms of delivery. So part of that business of Instacart is still delivered through the Kroger ecosystem. So the customer would come on to kroger.com or the Kroger app and would order a grocery delivery. Instacart would pick that product for us, but we're managing it through the Kroger ecosystem. So a significant part of our volume would flow through there. And then, of course, we're compensating Instacart or another third-party for that service. And that would also appear in OG&A. So it would be a similar area of the P&L. \n The part of the business where Instacart is using their own digital assets and the customers going through the digital ecosystem of Instacart, that would flow through more as a traditional sale and wouldn't have the same level of impact on the P&L. We are a big partner of Instacart. And obviously, we work very closely with them to make sure we're maximizing the efficiency of the model and continue to work on where we can improve the pass-through profitability on all those modalities. \nW. McMullen: And we would look constantly at people to partner with to help accelerate our experiences for our customers. So the example Gary gave is just one of many different partners and some are larger companies, some are smaller companies, but it's really how do we make sure we get -- deliver for the customer the way they want it delivered for them. \nOperator: The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nErica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I'm not sure how much color you can provide here, but we're trying to assess what benefits you've seen on the gross margin line in recent quarters that might go away in 2021. So as we look towards next year, with the potential for some of the recent grocery boom to reverse, should we be thinking about greater gross margin pressure than a typical year as the benefits from that sales leverage reverses? And is there anything positive or negative you can call out for us next year on the gross margin line as we think about comparisons and 2021 in general? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Erica. We wouldn't, at this point, get into specifics around 2021 detailed guidance as we plan to share more color on our overall outlook for next year at our Investor Day in March and through our Q4 update when we get to that. What I would say is, in general terms, I think it's important to remember that as we talk about the investments that we're making in gross margin today, many of those are in areas that matter most to the customer around personalized promotions and value offers that really resonate with the customer in the areas that we believe will drive loyalty long term, are in the most important categories for the customer around Fresh because that's what primarily drives their decision to shop with a food retailer.\n We continue to invest in advertising to grow our marketing effectiveness and share of voice. So these are the kind of investments that we've been making this year because everything we see in our data and insights says that for -- to ensure that we come out at the end of the COVID environment in a stronger position than we went in and winning market share, we believe those investments that we're making are critical to that, and they're creating increased separation from some of our traditional peers as we come towards that lapsing that time period with COVID. \n Many of those investments are answered at everyday low prices. So I wouldn't necessarily think of all of them as having to be incremental in 2021 versus 2020, because as we cycle those, we'll obviously be layering on new promotions next year, but they are new, and it's not one on top of the other. It's the new calendar of investments that we make. So I wouldn't necessarily think of the investments that we're making having to be dramatically different. There are certainly going to be some unique factors in the model next year when you start to see deleverage in some of the sales measures that they create some headwinds in the model that you cycle, but with the continued improvements that we're driving in sourcing, the continued improvements that we expect to drive within media revenue, within alternative profits, which went into gross margin, we still feel very good about the balance model that we've shared with you and the investment community around continuing to be able to balance investments with growing customer loyalty and driving overall earnings growth. \nW. McMullen: Gary just briefly mentioned it, and we'll get into more detail in March, but when you look at overall, we do see meaningful opportunities to continue through process change and take costs out both in goods not for resale, cost of goods and operating costs itself. And we'll get into more detail in March. But Gary mentioned, this year, we're on track to take over $1 billion out, and we still see opportunity in 2021 to take additional costs out while not affecting the customers' experience. \nErica Eiler: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just -- I mean given some recently -- some recent industry developments on the online pharmacy side, can you just remind us where Kroger is at right now with its efforts on online pharmacy side? What opportunities do you see going forward here? And also, just curious what you're seeing from the consumer adoption of your existing offerings? \nW. McMullen: Yes. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, pharmacy customer typically spends 3x more in our stores. And the pharmacy customer, for us, we've been working hard, our whole teams have, by treating food as medicine. And we're increasingly learning how to help customers eat healthier and live healthier. And for us, it's really the 2 working together is how we help customers stay healthy. \n If you look at some of the different cards in terms of discount offerings, those are things that we've been offering for several years. We have partnerships with GoodRx as an example and then others. And for us, we think it's part of the overall ecosystem. We really like the fact that we're able to help customers eat healthier and tie-in food. And it appears that about half of health care costs are driven by the way people eat, and we're helping people eat healthier. And it's a partnership that we think will work well. And one of the things that we find is customers still appreciate -- they appreciate online at times, delivery at times, but they also really appreciate having a health care professional that they can talk to one-on-one to answer their questions, and that's what we're able to offer, either in-person or on telehealth. \nOperator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Goldman: There's a decent amount of inflation up the supply chain from you, everything from corn to freight. Your net pricing, I think it's safe to say, it's already risen, thanks to reduced discounting, even if maybe you didn't pull back as much as your peers did. But I'm curious to what extent some of your vendors are asking you now to accept list price increases on their end because of inflation, and what your appetite is to take these increases and pass them on to consumers, especially as we think about the next few months. And I get it, right, you want to be competitive on price, but an argument can be made, you do have a chance to push some prices higher in a low elasticity environment, too. So I'm just curious for your thoughts there. \nW. McMullen: When you look at -- and I'll let Gary get into some of the details. But when you look at overall, a little bit of inflation always [ makes this ] a little easier. And we don't have [ anything ] when we have a little inflation. But as you know, we've built a business model that is strong, whether inflation is high or low or anything in between. If you look at the third quarter, inflation was a little bit lower in the third quarter than the second quarter, and that was primarily driven in the meat commodity, which was consistent with what we expected. \n You're going to always work with CPGs initially to try to find ways to take costs out of the system so that our customers don't have to have inflation. And it's something that every CPG, that partnership, is a different approach in terms of trying to figure out a way to minimize the impact on customers. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add or some of the specifics on Ken's question? \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Ken, I would say that overall, we're seeing, as Rodney mentioned, and you've probably heard us say before, we build our model based on sort of 0.5% to 1% inflation, aligned with Rodney's initial comment. We've been seeing inflation running more in the sort of 2% range, I would say, and slightly up or down, as Rodney mentioned, but generally speaking, in that kind of range. From our perspective, it's obviously hard to predict exactly where inflation goes. We don't see anything in the overall supply chain when you think about food in the system that would cause us to be dramatically different. But there are also risks, obviously, with COVID and what happened in the first quarter around meat, as Rodney also mentioned a moment ago, and there are certainly some produce categories but because of the season have had some supply shortages, too. \n But nothing that I would say that would take us dramatically today as we look forward outside of that sort of 2%, give or take, range. I think from that perspective, as Rodney said, we always look for ways to mitigate that wherever we can. Where it's justified and makes sense, then, of course, we look at how would that be passed on to the customer. And really, we try and disconnect between inflation and what makes sense to pass on and then our pricing investments, which are more focused on where do we believe customer is looking for the most value and what's going to drive long-term loyalty. So we really try and make sure that if it makes sense to pass to them, we'll do that. But we're always looking to identify ways in which we can really connect more deeply with the customer and build loyalty at the same time. \nKenneth Goldman: That's helpful. For my quick follow-up. We are hearing some indications and seeing some indications of consumers pantry loading a little bit over the last couple of weeks as COVID has unfortunately worsened. Can you help us with what you're seeing there? And maybe what that means for the quarter-to-date trend so far in terms of your numbers? \nW. McMullen: Ken, you said a word and [ Todd ] is trying to help me understand what you... \nUnknown Executive: Pantry load. \nW. McMullen: Pantry load. The -- we did put in limits on certain categories early in the quarter, and it was really -- the reason we did that was because of learnings from early. And we are -- as we mentioned, we've seen people shop fewer times, but buying more when they shop. The other thing on the holidays, obviously, on Christmas, time will tell, but -- and New Year's, but people obviously celebrated the holidays in a much smaller family gatherings than what they would have in the past year.\n So it's a little of all of the above that's going on. And one of the things that our supply chain team did was go and get access to additional warehouse space and then our procurement was able to buy some of the hard-to-find inventory, so that we will be there for our customers. So I would say, overall, it's pretty limited. It's a little stronger in the West than the Midwest just because of where different parts of the country are with COVID and their approach to COVID. But overall, not as much as what we saw early in the year, but some. \nGary Millerchip: Ken, the only thing I would add to the second part of your question. So when you look at the cadence of sales, last quarter I would say relatively consistent throughout the quarter, give or take a percent within the -- where we landed at the 10.9%, as Rodney mentioned. We certainly saw some variability by West versus Midwest. The West being more elevated, I think, because of some of the greater restrictions that were in place. As we look at the trend in the current quarter, it will be very similar in -- quarter-to-date in Q4 versus where we ended in Q3. \n What would be interesting there would be, though, is -- and Rodney alluded to this, was in the first couple of weeks of the quarter, we'd have seen more of that elevated spend in the weaker Thanksgiving, while in any normal environment the week would have been an outstanding week. It wouldn't have been at the same level as sort of a COVID typical week that we've seen. And so the blend of those 3 weeks gets you to looking very similar to where we were in Q3. \n And I think to Rodney's point, one of the things that the reason that we've left the guidance range out there is, clearly, we're expecting continued tailwind from executing our strategy and seeing COVID trends continuing food-at-home. But understanding how exactly the holidays play out when you've got 2 more holidays, a bit like Thanksgiving with Christmas and New Year still to come, and then Super Bowl actually fall into our fiscal year this year, whereas it did in the fiscal Q4 last year, and that has a fairly significant impact on sales as well. So how our customers spend holiday gatherings and how big their basket sizes are and how that behavior plays out is still something that will be, I think, interesting to see and evolve over the coming weeks and months. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMark Carden: It's Mark Carden on for Michael today. So you noted that you're continuing to take market share. Assuming this is relative to other retailers, where do you think it's coming from? Is it largely from small traditional players? Mass merchants? Another channel? A little more color here would be helpful. \nW. McMullen: Yes. As you know, we never really looked at market share in terms of where it's coming from. And we do everything we can to expand the market and then how are we doing within that market. So we think the market share is pretty broad-based. We're getting it by our existing customers spending more with us. Some of that is driven by our digital offerings in the seamlessness of the digital offer. Some of it's driven because we are getting new customers into our ecosystem, both digitally and in-store. So it's really very broad-based in terms of where it's coming from. \nMark Carden: Okay. And then as a follow-up, any update on the Walgreens initiative and whether you're looking to accelerate expansion there? \nW. McMullen: I would say we continue to learn. We really aren't yet in a position where we would decide whether to expand or whatever. It continues -- the customers react positively, but we are continuing to learn how to better and deeper connect with the customers. So happy, but still early on. \nOperator: The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. \nSpencer Hanus: This is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. My first question is, can you talk about how you think price investments are driving share shifts in this operating environment today? And are you seeing promotions becoming more important today than they were 3 or 6 months ago? And sort of how you're thinking about that as we head into 2021? \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look overall, and I'll let Gary get into more on some of the specifics, we just think it's important. Obviously, there are some customers whose financial situation continues to be very strong and growing, but there's other customers that their financial situation's been more pressed, especially as they've been affected in COVID in different ways, on losing jobs and things like that. We just believe, when you look at long-term, that it's important for customers to understand we did not take advantage of them during COVID. And we continue to invest both in everyday pricing and promotional pricing, and as Gary mentioned, like waiving fees for pickup, things like that, to try to help customers' budget to go further because we just think it's one of those things where the customer is going to appreciate everything that we've done during COVID, when we get out of COVID.\n The other thing, and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks that I'm so proud of the Kroger team is if you look at -- we've continued to make good progress on our Fresh dimensions, our Friendly dimensions relative to our competitors. And when you look at all of those things together between a seamless experience where a customer can go online, in-store, incredible Fresh experience that's better than they can get with our competition. And with great pricing and incredible promotions, we just really see no reason that customers would shop anywhere else. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think you covered it well, Rodney. The only point I would add, and you said it a moment ago, but as we look at the data over a longer period of time, and obviously, none of us have been through something like a pandemic like this before, but we look at periods where customers go through different economic conditions and different environments, whether that be through short-term, natural disasters that we manage or through a longer-term economic cycle. And our learnings over time are that it's really important to stay true to your values, and it's really important to continue to deliver what the customer expects consistently because over the longer term, it really does show through. And we think that's going to be very important to deliver on that expectation that we have to come out of COVID-19 stronger. \nSpencer Hanus: Great. That's really helpful. And then switching to online. Can you just give us an update on the basket size for online orders and how that compares to in-store orders? And would you expect that gap to widen over time? And then just an update on the incrementality, how incremental are online orders today? \nW. McMullen: If you look at the basket size, it's significantly higher. Over time, I've always assumed that it will get smaller as the customer gets more comfortable with shopping multiple channels. But I would say, take 10 of us, what average our average guests together, and that will probably be the closest that -- Gary, do you want to answer the last? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I would say, on incrementality, we're seeing -- and I mentioned some of this in my prepared remarks, but we're seeing very similar consistent patterns in incrementality. It would still be north of 50% in terms of when we look at what customers are buying, when they engage with us digitally. And then we look at it for a longer period of time and look at the categories and the products they were buying from us before engaging in digital, and you combine the total purchasing behavior between store and digital for that customer, we're seeing new categories and new products, and there's a -- on the basket that Rodney mentioned, it was significantly higher. The north of 50% of that basket is incremental when we look at the customers' shopping behavior over a longer period of time. \nOperator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nRenato Basanta: This is Renato Basanta on for Karen. So I wanted to follow up on next year, pretty high level, with respect to how you're thinking about the P&L. And appreciating sort of some of the color you've given already. If IDs are down mid-single digits next year, our math implies something like 200 basis points of margin deleverage. I mean you presumably lose some COVID costs and you had some cost savings flowing through. But I'm not totally sure that, that makes up for the deleverage. So just wondering if you could help us think about the P&L in that scenario? Specifically, what sticks in terms of COVID costs next year? And then any color on any other P&L levers you have to pull? \nGary Millerchip: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. I think overall, we think about -- I wouldn't get into specifics on the sales numbers because we're going to talk about those, as we mentioned, in our Investor Day. But we do believe when we look at customer behavior and how it's changing and some of the structural changes we're seeing and when we look at in previous economic downturns, which we think they'll still be, as Rodney mentioned, some customers that are going to continue to feel the economic impact of COVID for some time to come. That we would expect our 2-year stack sales to be above the traditional level that our model is built on because of how we're connecting with customers, how we're growing market share and some of those external factors. \n As you think specifically around the puts and takes in the model for next year, the areas where I think it would be important to be thinking about, and we'll be sharing more again in March when we provide that additional color, we would be expecting a significant amount of nonrecurring costs into next year, if you think about things like rewards and incentive plans, paying out based on performance in the business. If you think about some of the onetime costs we would have incurred in the early part of COVID. Even if you look at the run rate costs that we're incurring now versus the earlier part of the year, they would be significantly lower as we've optimized our plans and adjusted and by the back half of the year, I'm sure we're all hoping that a vaccine will be in place that starts to change the environment somewhat as well. \n So we would absolutely expect certain costs not to flow through into next year. We would expect our profit to continue to be growing. We -- that's not a business area where we expect to see a slowdown in momentum. We continue to see tremendous opportunity for growth. As you know, we've shared, I think, through Restock Kroger on cost savings, we'll deliver $1 billion this year. We delivered $1 billion in 2019 and 2018. They're all incremental on top of each other, and we wouldn't expect that to be the end of the story on cost savings either. So we would be expecting to share additional plans in next year for how we're going to drive continued cost out of the business. \n And in the health and wellness space, Rodney mentioned it, but COVID vaccines is certainly an opportunity. But even just more broadly, the pharmacy business, while we've continued to grow our business successfully, it has definitely had some impacts of customers visiting the doctor less frequently and therefore, new scripts being added as would be a headwind versus what potentially becomes a tailwind next year. To your point, we would still expect and contemplate some COVID cost to carry over into next year. We would expect to be continuing to invest in the business, as we always do, to drive loyalty and drive long-term market share gains. We would think fuel will be a headwind likely next year, too, just because of some of the unique circumstances in Q1 this year when you think about the Russia, Saudi Arabia incident that caused prices to get completely in an odd position that drove margins at a level that we're unlikely to repeat.\n So I think there's a lot of moving parts in next year, and that's why we think it's important that we provide you with a much fuller picture in March when we feel like we've got clarity on what the full picture looks like for next year. But overall, we feel very confident in our ability to -- on a 2-year basis, the earnings per share growth on a compounded rate and ID sales growth, though, to be ahead of where we would have expected our TSR model we shared in November last year. \nRenato Basanta: Okay. That's great color. And then just wanted to get your perspective with respect to labor costs. You mentioned you're all-in average wages. But can you give some color on what your actual entry-level wages and how many associates are actually at that level. And presumably, the federal minimum wage could go to $15 an hour. So wondering how you're thinking about managing that possibility for next year? \nW. McMullen: Yes. We have very few of our associates at minimum wage, and about 90% of those are younger than 18 years old or 18 years and younger. So it's people who -- it's their first job. And as you know, we have a ton of people that come to work for us as a job and then make it a career. And we want to make sure that we're providing great career opportunities for people's income can continue to improve. We are -- whatever the federal minimum wage is, we're comfortable with that. We don't take a position on that because as long as our competitors have the same costs as we do, we're very comfortable on operating on an even ground. We -- it's always not good when we have a cost they don't have. So we don't take a position on federal minimum wage, and we view that, that's the politicians' responsibility. \n As I mentioned, and as you know, as part of Restock Kroger, we originally included $500 million for incremental pay increases. And so far, we've actually done $800 million of incremental pay increases for our associates in addition to providing great benefits for paid time off, sick vacation and other things. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rodney McMullen for any closing remarks. \nW. McMullen: Thank you for your questions today. I wish all of you and your friends and family happy holidays, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year and encourage you to stay safe. \n At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit, which means that we are called to do more and help make the lives of those around us better. When we see our associates, customers and neighbors affected by systematic racism, discrimination and injustice, we are called to speak out and act in accordance with our values. Over the past several months, we've listened closely to our 0.5 million associates in countless communities across the nation to learn what we can do better to accelerate and promote greater change and equity in our workplace and the communities we serve. \n We recently shared our framework for action, diversity, equity and inclusion plan. This plan is just the beginning. We are approaching this effort with humility, knowing that we can't do it alone and don't and won't have all the answers. But we are committed. I am committed to continuing to listen, to speak out and to take action.\n That concludes our call for today. Thanks again for your questions, and thanks for your time. Goodbye. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's third quarter 2020 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. \n When restrictions were set in place to address the spread of COVID-19 in mid-March, many underestimated the length of time that it would last and the number of families and communities that would be impacted. Many of the stories from the last 9 months have been upsetting, to say the least. Out of this grief, we've also seen the best parts of human nature. From our store teams to our warehouse associates and drivers and our digital teams, plants and offices, our Kroger family of associates have been nothing short of incredible during this period. I am proud of our dedicated associates who have continued to diligently execute our Restock Kroger transformation while serving our customers when they need us most.\n We delivered strong results in the third quarter. Customers are at the center of everything we do and sales remain elevated, and we continue to grow market share as we enhance our competitive moats, Fresh, Our Brands, Data & Personalization and Seamless. I want to highlight that Kroger's digital sales are incrementally profitable today, partly supported by our rapidly growing digital media business and partially fueled by our constant improvement in operational efficiency. This is true as an incremental pass-through rate of sales, and we have a clear path to continue improving digital profitability. Gary will touch on this more in a few minutes, but I wanted to call this out as well because it demonstrates the strength of not only our Seamless offering, but the overall Kroger ecosystem and how the components parts fit together to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders.\n We are more certain than ever that the strategic choices and investments made over the last 3 years have positioned us to meet the moment. And as a result of our strong performance and consistent market share gains, we are raising our guidance for the remainder of the year. We are also positioned to deliver beyond 2020 for our customers, associates and shareholders as we believe a number of the impacts of COVID-19 will be structural and lasting.\n As a result of the pandemic, we continue to see increased basket sizes and fewer customer visits. Customers across the country are still staying home and cooking at home is now part of the new routine. We are fulfilling our customers' growing demand for premium products as they seek joy and elevated experiences. We're merchandising in new ways to both meet that demand and inspire our customers to trade up to items like premium jumbo blueberries, and by the way, they're delicious, and larger-sized packages of strawberries, raspberries and grapes.\n Home Chef's culinary innovation is inspiring customers with new oven-ready entre\u0301es and sides, flat bread, pizzas, salads and sandwiches. In the Fresh soup category, we have introduced new flavorful and delicious Simple Truth and Home Chef varieties. Our efforts are also driving strong market share gain in -- growth in packaged produce, fresh prepared foods and specialty cheese.\n This is also where our brands really shine. Our multi-tiered brand portfolio positions us well to deliver against our customers' diverse needs and desires. Our Brand grew at 8.6% in the third quarter, and we grew market share. Private Selection grew over 17% and Simple Truth grew nearly 15%. These are incredible numbers and demonstrate that while many competitors offer private label products, Kroger's unique approach to Our Brands is a differentiator in a competitive moat. \n By leveraging our unique data and customer insights, we continue to be at the forefront of product innovation and new product development. During the third quarter, we launched 250 new items, the most ever in a single quarter. New items for the quarter included launches in trending focus areas such as fresh produce, frozen grocery and expansion of our Simple Truth plant-based collection, unveiling more than 50 new fresh and flavorful plant-based foods at affordable prices.\n Moving now to our third competitive moat, Data & Personalization. Many retailers have transactional data, but no one has the customer data and the insights that Kroger has. The quality of our data is a massive advantage because it allows us to develop a significant alternative profit business that generates income from the traffic while benefiting our customers. Our personalization efforts motivate our customers to continue to show interest in Kroger's communications, where nearly 80% have asked to receive relevant information and offers from us. \n Our customer e-mail open rate is nearly 18% higher than the industry average, which illustrates our ability to offer relevant content and offers to our customers. We continue to advance our personalization technology. About 95% of customer interactions with product on our website and app are enabled by personalization, driving a significantly higher level of engagement in our offers and nearly doubling the likelihood of adding an item to a cart.\n Our store's competitive moat is Seamless. Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As part of our journey, we have been evolving our fulfillment network. First, taking advantage of our existing assets, our physical stores, providing flexibility and proximity to our customers with broad and relevant assortment to meet their needs. Second, expanding our network of assets and capabilities with a portfolio of various-sized facilities optimized based on volume, demand profile and density, leveraging scale and automation to meet the rapidly changing customer needs.\n Our early investments lay the foundation, including over 2,200 pickup locations and over 2,450 delivery locations, which allowed us to capture the increased customer demand for e-commerce offerings during the pandemic we have today, reaching 98% of our customers with a seamless customer experience around in-store shopping, pickup, delivery and ship-to-home modalities. \n We are innovating and building out a flexible network of fulfillment options and working with key solutions providers. As we recently announced, we continue to progress on our Ocado facilities program with plans to build customer fulfillment centers in Michigan and in the south region of the country. The upcoming opening of our first 2 fulfillment centers in early 2021 in Monroe, Ohio and Groveland, Florida in collaboration to leverage some of their in-store fulfillment capabilities. \n We work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure in the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. We are focused on both developing, training and promoting internal talent and hiring external industry executives, which together drives our retail supermarket business as well as our other businesses. \n Kroger has been investing to raise the wages of our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, over the period of 2018 to 2020, Kroger will have invested an incremental $800 million per year in associate wage increases. As we've noted before, this is $300 million more than the original planned investment. As a result of our continued focus on growing associate wages, Kroger has increased its average wage rate to over $20 per hour with our comprehensive and best-in-class benefits, including health care, paid time off and retirement included. \n As the largest grocery retailer in America, Kroger is committed to being a force for good in the communities we serve. Our purpose to feed the human spirit continues to guide how we operate our business, care for our communities and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Since launching our ambitious Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan in 2017, we achieved our goal to donate more than 1 billion meals to feed hungry families in our communities by 2020. We also continue to increase Kroger's diversion of waste from landfill, reaching 80% diversion last year on our path to achieve 90% diversion or Zero Waste. This year, Kroger outlined several new long-term environmental commitments and they can be found in our annual environmental, social and governance report. \n Last month, we were proud to be included among the world's sustainability leaders, recognized by our inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the eighth year in a row. We are committed to continuing to integrate ESG metrics into our business strategy, driving shared value for our associates, customers, communities and shareholders. \n Since March, we have invested nearly $1.3 billion to both reward our associates and to protect our associates and customers through the implementation of dozens of safety measures like installing protective partitions and physical distancing floor decals. We continue to require masks and limit the number of people in our stores to allow for physical distancing and ensure frequent and proper cleaning procedures are followed. We also promote additional ways to shop using pickup or no-contact delivery. Our total COVID-19 incident rate continues to track below the rate in the surrounding communities where we operate. \n Our supply chain remains strong and healthy, and we are replenishing our stores daily so that the supplies and products our customers need are readily available. To ensure our customers have access to what they need, we have proactively secured an additional 5,000 truckloads of inventory and increased distribution capacity reserves by 20% within our supply chain to get ahead and avoid potential supply disruptions.\n Furthermore, we have flexed our national footprint by dynamically shifting volume from constrained facilities and regions to facilities and regions with available capacity to accommodate. As America's grocer, we continue to see the unique opportunity to be part of our customers' healthy journey in addition to being their grocer of choice. Throughout the pandemic, we have remained committed to helping people live healthier lives by offering in-clinic and at-home COVID-19 testing solutions, supported by our team of experienced health care professionals. \n The size and scale of our health care footprint with over 2,200 pharmacies and 220 clinics in 35 states provide us the unique ability to efficiently facilitate COVID-19 testing and immunize a large portion of the U.S. population once vaccines become available. Kroger Health has conducted over 250,000 COVID-19 tests since April and has recently launched rapid antibody tests, which are now available across our family of pharmacies and clinics. \n We are also partners in the federal -- with the federal government effort to deliver hundreds of millions of potentially life-saving vaccines to our communities. We have also partnered with dozens of state health departments in preparation for the other early administration of vaccines to priority populations. Once an FDA-authorized vaccine is available, we're committed to making it accessible in accordance with the federal rollout plan. All our pharmacies and clinics are staffed with professionals, licensed pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and technicians. \n Health and wellness is a critical part of our customer value proposition. Pharmacy customers are more loyal, spending 3x more per customer. We have approached pharmacy from an omnichannel perspective for quite some time, allowing customers to choose the most appropriate channel in which to connect with us, whether that be in-store, on the phone or online. For all channels, our strategy is consistent: simplify health care by creating solutions that combine health, wellness and nutrition. I continue to be proud of the work that our associates do to serve each other, our customers and our communities. Stories of their accomplishments and selflessness inspire me every day. The investments we have made to enhance our competitive moats are paying off and as a result, we are growing market share.\n I will now turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? Thank you, Gary. We are executing against our strategy even during the pandemic and continue to grow market share. The strong underlying momentum in our core supermarket business and acceleration in the growth of our alternative profit business demonstrates that we are successfully transforming our business model to deliver consistently strong and attractive total shareholder return in 2020 and beyond. \n Now we look forward to your questions. Yes. Thanks, Simeon, for the question. If you look at e-commerce, as Gary and I both mentioned, incrementally, it is profitable this quarter on the incremental growth, and it was driven by the continued improvement in reducing the costs to serve our digital customer and the incremental growth in media. And as both of us mentioned, we would expect to continue to make progress on both of those fronts. \n As you look to 2021, we expect -- obviously, the digital growth won't be as much as it was in 2020, but we would expect for the customer to continue to expect and want digital service. But the thing that, to me, is inspiring and great to see is customers that are digital shoppers generally still continue to come into the store to use -- to have an in-store experience when they want to. And that customer basically spends double what they spend if they don't.\n So we really like the overall Seamless omnichannel experience that we're delivering and creating for the customer. And we would expect, as we continue going forward, that we'll continue to make progress on the profitability of that digital shopper. And then obviously, once you get past the start-up cost of Ocado and some of the micro fulfillment centers, things like that, that is significantly even lower cost than serving the customer in the store. So when we really look at all the pieces together, we love the progress we're making and we're excited about the continued progress we expect to make. \n We -- everything we can see, we think the pandemic has accelerated the growth or transition to digital probably by 3 years or so. It wouldn't surprise me if it dropped off a smidgen, but I think it will continue to grow from that because it is a long-term trend where a customer really expects to be able to get something in-store, pickup or delivery, and they expect to be able to bounce back and forth based on what's easy for them. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? And we would look constantly at people to partner with to help accelerate our experiences for our customers. So the example Gary gave is just one of many different partners and some are larger companies, some are smaller companies, but it's really how do we make sure we get -- deliver for the customer the way they want it delivered for them. Gary just briefly mentioned it, and we'll get into more detail in March, but when you look at overall, we do see meaningful opportunities to continue through process change and take costs out both in goods not for resale, cost of goods and operating costs itself. And we'll get into more detail in March. But Gary mentioned, this year, we're on track to take over $1 billion out, and we still see opportunity in 2021 to take additional costs out while not affecting the customers' experience. Yes. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, pharmacy customer typically spends 3x more in our stores. And the pharmacy customer, for us, we've been working hard, our whole teams have, by treating food as medicine. And we're increasingly learning how to help customers eat healthier and live healthier. And for us, it's really the 2 working together is how we help customers stay healthy. \n If you look at some of the different cards in terms of discount offerings, those are things that we've been offering for several years. We have partnerships with GoodRx as an example and then others. And for us, we think it's part of the overall ecosystem. We really like the fact that we're able to help customers eat healthier and tie-in food. And it appears that about half of health care costs are driven by the way people eat, and we're helping people eat healthier. And it's a partnership that we think will work well. And one of the things that we find is customers still appreciate -- they appreciate online at times, delivery at times, but they also really appreciate having a health care professional that they can talk to one-on-one to answer their questions, and that's what we're able to offer, either in-person or on telehealth. When you look at -- and I'll let Gary get into some of the details. But when you look at overall, a little bit of inflation always [ makes this ] a little easier. And we don't have [ anything ] when we have a little inflation. But as you know, we've built a business model that is strong, whether inflation is high or low or anything in between. If you look at the third quarter, inflation was a little bit lower in the third quarter than the second quarter, and that was primarily driven in the meat commodity, which was consistent with what we expected. \n You're going to always work with CPGs initially to try to find ways to take costs out of the system so that our customers don't have to have inflation. And it's something that every CPG, that partnership, is a different approach in terms of trying to figure out a way to minimize the impact on customers. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add or some of the specifics on Ken's question? Ken, you said a word and [ Todd ] is trying to help me understand what you... Pantry load. The -- we did put in limits on certain categories early in the quarter, and it was really -- the reason we did that was because of learnings from early. And we are -- as we mentioned, we've seen people shop fewer times, but buying more when they shop. The other thing on the holidays, obviously, on Christmas, time will tell, but -- and New Year's, but people obviously celebrated the holidays in a much smaller family gatherings than what they would have in the past year.\n So it's a little of all of the above that's going on. And one of the things that our supply chain team did was go and get access to additional warehouse space and then our procurement was able to buy some of the hard-to-find inventory, so that we will be there for our customers. So I would say, overall, it's pretty limited. It's a little stronger in the West than the Midwest just because of where different parts of the country are with COVID and their approach to COVID. But overall, not as much as what we saw early in the year, but some. Yes. As you know, we never really looked at market share in terms of where it's coming from. And we do everything we can to expand the market and then how are we doing within that market. So we think the market share is pretty broad-based. We're getting it by our existing customers spending more with us. Some of that is driven by our digital offerings in the seamlessness of the digital offer. Some of it's driven because we are getting new customers into our ecosystem, both digitally and in-store. So it's really very broad-based in terms of where it's coming from. I would say we continue to learn. We really aren't yet in a position where we would decide whether to expand or whatever. It continues -- the customers react positively, but we are continuing to learn how to better and deeper connect with the customers. So happy, but still early on. Yes. If you look overall, and I'll let Gary get into more on some of the specifics, we just think it's important. Obviously, there are some customers whose financial situation continues to be very strong and growing, but there's other customers that their financial situation's been more pressed, especially as they've been affected in COVID in different ways, on losing jobs and things like that. We just believe, when you look at long-term, that it's important for customers to understand we did not take advantage of them during COVID. And we continue to invest both in everyday pricing and promotional pricing, and as Gary mentioned, like waiving fees for pickup, things like that, to try to help customers' budget to go further because we just think it's one of those things where the customer is going to appreciate everything that we've done during COVID, when we get out of COVID.\n The other thing, and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks that I'm so proud of the Kroger team is if you look at -- we've continued to make good progress on our Fresh dimensions, our Friendly dimensions relative to our competitors. And when you look at all of those things together between a seamless experience where a customer can go online, in-store, incredible Fresh experience that's better than they can get with our competition. And with great pricing and incredible promotions, we just really see no reason that customers would shop anywhere else. If you look at the basket size, it's significantly higher. Over time, I've always assumed that it will get smaller as the customer gets more comfortable with shopping multiple channels. But I would say, take 10 of us, what average our average guests together, and that will probably be the closest that -- Gary, do you want to answer the last? Yes. We have very few of our associates at minimum wage, and about 90% of those are younger than 18 years old or 18 years and younger. So it's people who -- it's their first job. And as you know, we have a ton of people that come to work for us as a job and then make it a career. And we want to make sure that we're providing great career opportunities for people's income can continue to improve. We are -- whatever the federal minimum wage is, we're comfortable with that. We don't take a position on that because as long as our competitors have the same costs as we do, we're very comfortable on operating on an even ground. We -- it's always not good when we have a cost they don't have. So we don't take a position on federal minimum wage, and we view that, that's the politicians' responsibility. \n As I mentioned, and as you know, as part of Restock Kroger, we originally included $500 million for incremental pay increases. And so far, we've actually done $800 million of incremental pay increases for our associates in addition to providing great benefits for paid time off, sick vacation and other things.

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. The Kroger team delivered strong results in the third quarter and provided a further proof point of the value creation model we shared at our Investor Day last year. We grew market share and, consistent with our value creation model, were disciplined in balancing significant investments in our customers and our associates with improved productivity and accelerated growth in our alternative profit businesses. The investments we are making in our business are allowing us to deliver strong results today and, importantly, are also setting us up to deliver sustained growth in the future. \n I'll now provide more color on our third quarter results. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.71 per diluted share, up 51% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 10.9% during the third quarter and continued to gain market share. Our identical sales growth increase was broad-based and all departments, excluding fuel, achieved positive growth over the prior year. Meat and produce departments led the way, continuing to underscore the importance of Fresh and how we differentiate in quality and assortment for our customers. \n Digital sales grew 108% in the third quarter and contributed approximately 4.6% to identical sales without fuel. Customer engagement with our digital solutions is driving overall loyalty. When customers engage with both our physical stores and digital channels, they visit more frequently and, on average, spend twice as much as those who shop in store only. The vast majority of our digital customers are shopping in-store as well as online. We are, therefore, confident that the seamless experience we are building across our store and digital ecosystem position us well for continued growth in a post-COVID world.\n At the same time, digital sales growth in the quarter was profitable on an incremental basis, and we continue to improve digital profitability by lowering the cost to fulfill a pickup order and accelerating digital advertising revenue. As Rodney noted, we see a clear path to further improve digital profitability by leveraging our personalization tools to increase basket size and improve sales mix, further reduce the cost to fulfill an order via process improvements and automation, and continue to grow digital media revenue.\n We are also excited about the value our merger with Home Chef has brought to our digital capabilities, both in terms of the extended meal solutions offered for our customers and the significant sales growth and profitability improvements the business is achieving. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the third quarter was $871 million, up 33% compared to the third quarter of 2019. We were pleased with our ability to consistently pass-through the benefits of elevated sales in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations and guidance previously shared.\n Gross margin was 23% of sales in the third quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. We achieved improvements in gross margin during the quarter through sourcing efficiencies, sales leverage and growth in alternative profit streams. These tailwinds were offset by changes in the sales mix as a result of COVID-19 and continued investments to deliver greater value for our customers, ensuring we sustain long-term customer loyalty and position the business for success in 2021 and beyond. \n The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 30 basis points. This reflects sales leverage and strong cost control through execution of Restock Kroger initiatives, which more than offset continued COVID-19-related investments to protect the health and safety of our associates, customers and communities and increased incentive costs. We were pleased with progress on our Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives in the quarter and continue to be on track to achieve the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020.\n As an example, through the implementation of multiple process and technology improvements this year, we have been able to reduce the cost to fulfill a pickup order in-store by double digits compared to the same period last year, while at the same time improving the customer experience by significantly reducing customer wait times. Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. Consistent with market trends, our decline in gallons in the third quarter slowed to around 13%. We remain well positioned within our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and our market-leading reward program. The average retail price of fuel was $2.15 this quarter versus $2.62 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the third quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.30 in the same quarter last year. \n Kroger's alternative profit businesses are built on a platform that leverages our supermarket traffic and data. Our alternative profit businesses had a very strong third quarter, led by tremendous growth in our digital media business, Kroger Precision Marketing. On the strength of growth in digital sales, digital customer engagement and new inventory, KPM achieved revenue growth of over 190%. Over 1,200 brands are now engaging with KPM as a better way to invest marketing dollars that were previously being spent with advertising platforms and digital media companies. \n CPG brands continue to leverage our audience intelligence for more effective brand building activations that are achieving better return on ad spend. Thanks to our team's nimbleness and responding to the challenges presented by COVID, our alternative profit businesses are performing well, and we now expect profit growth to exceed $100 million for the fiscal year 2020.\n We continue to believe alternative profit will be a major accelerator of our model in the future and COVID-19 has not changed the long-term profit expectations previously shared as part of Restock Kroger. We continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. As you know, for the last decade or more, Kroger has sought opportunities to address the funding challenges facing the multi-employer pension plans in which many of our associates participate.\n We believe charges related to pension funding can be mitigated if plans are reviewed and addressed over time. In July, we announced a tentative agreement to improve security for future retirement benefits of over 33,000 Kroger family of company associates across 20 local UFCW unions with a pretax investment of nearly $1 billion that will be satisfied by installment payments over the next 3 years. I'm pleased to say that, that agreement is now being ratified by participating union locals and Kroger will incur a charge to net earnings during the fourth quarter of approximately $0.98 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. This does not affect adjusted net earnings per diluted share results for 2020, which are provided on a basis that excludes adjustment items such as this contribution. \n We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Las Vegas and Dallas during the third quarter. Last week, we ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering associates in West Virginia, and we are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Little Rock, Houston and Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhanced job security for our associates.\n Turning now to financial strategy. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to our previously communicated capital allocation framework. We are continuing to invest in the business to drive profitable growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and the growing dividend over time. We now expect total capital expenditures to range between $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion in 2020. This lower range is primarily due to the expected delay in when spend will occur as a result of COVID-19. We are being disciplined in how we deploy capital to ensure that our investments will deliver strong returns, and we continue to see many opportunities to invest in the business to support sustainable long-term revenue and profit growth consistent with our CSR goals. \n Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.74 compared to 2.5 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strong liquidity reflects our elevated operating performance and significant improvements in working capital. This improvement in working capital includes the impact of temporary increase in warehousing and buildup of inventory during the third quarter that Rodney referenced earlier, which we implemented to minimize supply disruptions as a result of higher COVID cases forecast over the winter months.\n During the quarter, Kroger repurchased $304 million of shares under its $1 billion board authorization announced on September 11, 2020. Year-to-date, Kroger has now repurchased $989 million of shares. In June, Kroger increased the dividend by 13%, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases.\n Finally, I'd like to provide additional color on our guidance for the remainder of 2020. As we shared previously, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the outlook for food retail, and we continue to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. As a result of our continued strong sales and market share performance and the expectation of sustained trends in food at home consumption for the remainder of our fiscal year, we are raising our full year 2020 guidance. \n For the full year 2020, we now expect total identical sales without fuel to be around 14%. We expect to achieve adjusted EPS growth of approximately 50% to 53%, and adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. Our guidance contemplates continued investments in the customer and ongoing COVID-19-related costs to protect the safety of our customers and associates, balanced with continued execution of cost-saving initiatives and growth in alternative profits.\n Looking towards 2021, we believe that our performance will be stronger than we would have expected prior to the pandemic when viewed as a 2-year stacked result for identical sales without fuel growth and as a compounded growth rate over 2020 and 2021 for adjusted earnings per share growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to achieve consistently attractive total shareholder returns. We look forward to providing detailed guidance for 2021 and updating you on our road map to deliver long-term growth in March next year. \n And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. Well, I agree completely, Rodney, with your overall comments. Maybe a couple of specifics, I mean, into 2020 and 2021, just to build on some of Rodney's comments. First of all, as you think about 2020, we talked about the pass-through rates, obviously being lower on digital although being incrementally positive. So the way it would show up in our P&L is where typically on the sales growth that we're seeing this year. We might have normally seen a pass-through rate of north of 15% on a traditional brick-and-mortar sale. The blended rate between digital and store and having in the COVID cost may be coming in around 10% versus that 15% or higher. So a combination of lower pass-through rate on digital and the incremental COVID cost will be bringing down that overall blended rate. \n Interestingly, though, on a specific example, as you know, we took away the fee on a promotional basis during the quarter. So that would be a headwind to gross margin. But actually, the value that we're creating through media revenue is really offsetting that. So we've been able to invest in the customer while still being able to replace that revenue by offering personalized digital communications to customers that drive new revenue streams to offset that promotional activity. \n As you think about 2021, just one sort of -- I guess, an unusual phenomenon just to think through it, but the more improvements we make now on our digital business as we're continuing to improve digital profitability, so as we take cost out of the cost fulfillment order, as we grow the average order value through personalization, as we grow media revenue, that -- those tailwinds will be -- if we achieve them in Q3 this year, we'll get the full benefit on the whole volume next year. So actually on the same level of business, digital would be a tailwind in next year's financial model. Now obviously, as digital continues to grow, it will create some additional investment next year. But on the base level of business that we're generating in 2020 as you create the full benefit from those cost savings from media revenue, it will become a tailwind on that base level business next year in terms of improving profitability of digital. Yes. Simeon, you'd be correct in the way in which our core pickup business would show up in our P&L as a lower pass-through rate is the labor associated with picking the product in the store. That's what drives the mid-single-digit pass-through rate versus the sort of high-teen rate, if you like, on a traditional brick-and-mortar sale. We have a fairly unique model, I think, with Instacart. They are our predominant partner. We do use other partners as well in terms of delivery. So part of that business of Instacart is still delivered through the Kroger ecosystem. So the customer would come on to kroger.com or the Kroger app and would order a grocery delivery. Instacart would pick that product for us, but we're managing it through the Kroger ecosystem. So a significant part of our volume would flow through there. And then, of course, we're compensating Instacart or another third-party for that service. And that would also appear in OG&A. So it would be a similar area of the P&L. \n The part of the business where Instacart is using their own digital assets and the customers going through the digital ecosystem of Instacart, that would flow through more as a traditional sale and wouldn't have the same level of impact on the P&L. We are a big partner of Instacart. And obviously, we work very closely with them to make sure we're maximizing the efficiency of the model and continue to work on where we can improve the pass-through profitability on all those modalities. Yes. Thanks for the question, Erica. We wouldn't, at this point, get into specifics around 2021 detailed guidance as we plan to share more color on our overall outlook for next year at our Investor Day in March and through our Q4 update when we get to that. What I would say is, in general terms, I think it's important to remember that as we talk about the investments that we're making in gross margin today, many of those are in areas that matter most to the customer around personalized promotions and value offers that really resonate with the customer in the areas that we believe will drive loyalty long term, are in the most important categories for the customer around Fresh because that's what primarily drives their decision to shop with a food retailer.\n We continue to invest in advertising to grow our marketing effectiveness and share of voice. So these are the kind of investments that we've been making this year because everything we see in our data and insights says that for -- to ensure that we come out at the end of the COVID environment in a stronger position than we went in and winning market share, we believe those investments that we're making are critical to that, and they're creating increased separation from some of our traditional peers as we come towards that lapsing that time period with COVID. \n Many of those investments are answered at everyday low prices. So I wouldn't necessarily think of all of them as having to be incremental in 2021 versus 2020, because as we cycle those, we'll obviously be layering on new promotions next year, but they are new, and it's not one on top of the other. It's the new calendar of investments that we make. So I wouldn't necessarily think of the investments that we're making having to be dramatically different. There are certainly going to be some unique factors in the model next year when you start to see deleverage in some of the sales measures that they create some headwinds in the model that you cycle, but with the continued improvements that we're driving in sourcing, the continued improvements that we expect to drive within media revenue, within alternative profits, which went into gross margin, we still feel very good about the balance model that we've shared with you and the investment community around continuing to be able to balance investments with growing customer loyalty and driving overall earnings growth. Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Ken, I would say that overall, we're seeing, as Rodney mentioned, and you've probably heard us say before, we build our model based on sort of 0.5% to 1% inflation, aligned with Rodney's initial comment. We've been seeing inflation running more in the sort of 2% range, I would say, and slightly up or down, as Rodney mentioned, but generally speaking, in that kind of range. From our perspective, it's obviously hard to predict exactly where inflation goes. We don't see anything in the overall supply chain when you think about food in the system that would cause us to be dramatically different. But there are also risks, obviously, with COVID and what happened in the first quarter around meat, as Rodney also mentioned a moment ago, and there are certainly some produce categories but because of the season have had some supply shortages, too. \n But nothing that I would say that would take us dramatically today as we look forward outside of that sort of 2%, give or take, range. I think from that perspective, as Rodney said, we always look for ways to mitigate that wherever we can. Where it's justified and makes sense, then, of course, we look at how would that be passed on to the customer. And really, we try and disconnect between inflation and what makes sense to pass on and then our pricing investments, which are more focused on where do we believe customer is looking for the most value and what's going to drive long-term loyalty. So we really try and make sure that if it makes sense to pass to them, we'll do that. But we're always looking to identify ways in which we can really connect more deeply with the customer and build loyalty at the same time. Ken, the only thing I would add to the second part of your question. So when you look at the cadence of sales, last quarter I would say relatively consistent throughout the quarter, give or take a percent within the -- where we landed at the 10.9%, as Rodney mentioned. We certainly saw some variability by West versus Midwest. The West being more elevated, I think, because of some of the greater restrictions that were in place. As we look at the trend in the current quarter, it will be very similar in -- quarter-to-date in Q4 versus where we ended in Q3. \n What would be interesting there would be, though, is -- and Rodney alluded to this, was in the first couple of weeks of the quarter, we'd have seen more of that elevated spend in the weaker Thanksgiving, while in any normal environment the week would have been an outstanding week. It wouldn't have been at the same level as sort of a COVID typical week that we've seen. And so the blend of those 3 weeks gets you to looking very similar to where we were in Q3. \n And I think to Rodney's point, one of the things that the reason that we've left the guidance range out there is, clearly, we're expecting continued tailwind from executing our strategy and seeing COVID trends continuing food-at-home. But understanding how exactly the holidays play out when you've got 2 more holidays, a bit like Thanksgiving with Christmas and New Year still to come, and then Super Bowl actually fall into our fiscal year this year, whereas it did in the fiscal Q4 last year, and that has a fairly significant impact on sales as well. So how our customers spend holiday gatherings and how big their basket sizes are and how that behavior plays out is still something that will be, I think, interesting to see and evolve over the coming weeks and months. Yes. I think you covered it well, Rodney. The only point I would add, and you said it a moment ago, but as we look at the data over a longer period of time, and obviously, none of us have been through something like a pandemic like this before, but we look at periods where customers go through different economic conditions and different environments, whether that be through short-term, natural disasters that we manage or through a longer-term economic cycle. And our learnings over time are that it's really important to stay true to your values, and it's really important to continue to deliver what the customer expects consistently because over the longer term, it really does show through. And we think that's going to be very important to deliver on that expectation that we have to come out of COVID-19 stronger. Yes. I would say, on incrementality, we're seeing -- and I mentioned some of this in my prepared remarks, but we're seeing very similar consistent patterns in incrementality. It would still be north of 50% in terms of when we look at what customers are buying, when they engage with us digitally. And then we look at it for a longer period of time and look at the categories and the products they were buying from us before engaging in digital, and you combine the total purchasing behavior between store and digital for that customer, we're seeing new categories and new products, and there's a -- on the basket that Rodney mentioned, it was significantly higher. The north of 50% of that basket is incremental when we look at the customers' shopping behavior over a longer period of time. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. I think overall, we think about -- I wouldn't get into specifics on the sales numbers because we're going to talk about those, as we mentioned, in our Investor Day. But we do believe when we look at customer behavior and how it's changing and some of the structural changes we're seeing and when we look at in previous economic downturns, which we think they'll still be, as Rodney mentioned, some customers that are going to continue to feel the economic impact of COVID for some time to come. That we would expect our 2-year stack sales to be above the traditional level that our model is built on because of how we're connecting with customers, how we're growing market share and some of those external factors. \n As you think specifically around the puts and takes in the model for next year, the areas where I think it would be important to be thinking about, and we'll be sharing more again in March when we provide that additional color, we would be expecting a significant amount of nonrecurring costs into next year, if you think about things like rewards and incentive plans, paying out based on performance in the business. If you think about some of the onetime costs we would have incurred in the early part of COVID. Even if you look at the run rate costs that we're incurring now versus the earlier part of the year, they would be significantly lower as we've optimized our plans and adjusted and by the back half of the year, I'm sure we're all hoping that a vaccine will be in place that starts to change the environment somewhat as well. \n So we would absolutely expect certain costs not to flow through into next year. We would expect our profit to continue to be growing. We -- that's not a business area where we expect to see a slowdown in momentum. We continue to see tremendous opportunity for growth. As you know, we've shared, I think, through Restock Kroger on cost savings, we'll deliver $1 billion this year. We delivered $1 billion in 2019 and 2018. They're all incremental on top of each other, and we wouldn't expect that to be the end of the story on cost savings either. So we would be expecting to share additional plans in next year for how we're going to drive continued cost out of the business. \n And in the health and wellness space, Rodney mentioned it, but COVID vaccines is certainly an opportunity. But even just more broadly, the pharmacy business, while we've continued to grow our business successfully, it has definitely had some impacts of customers visiting the doctor less frequently and therefore, new scripts being added as would be a headwind versus what potentially becomes a tailwind next year. To your point, we would still expect and contemplate some COVID cost to carry over into next year. We would expect to be continuing to invest in the business, as we always do, to drive loyalty and drive long-term market share gains. We would think fuel will be a headwind likely next year, too, just because of some of the unique circumstances in Q1 this year when you think about the Russia, Saudi Arabia incident that caused prices to get completely in an odd position that drove margins at a level that we're unlikely to repeat.\n So I think there's a lot of moving parts in next year, and that's why we think it's important that we provide you with a much fuller picture in March when we feel like we've got clarity on what the full picture looks like for next year. But overall, we feel very confident in our ability to -- on a 2-year basis, the earnings per share growth on a compounded rate and ID sales growth, though, to be ahead of where we would have expected our TSR model we shared in November last year."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.\n Our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. This is obviously an unprecedented time, and we are taking the additional step of providing more details on current business trends this quarter, so our prepared remarks may run a little longer than normal. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]\n Please mark October 27 on your calendar for a brief business update from Rodney McMullen and Gary Millerchip on our performance against Restock Kroger goals and how the pandemic is shaping our business model. Given the travel restrictions that are still in place, this meeting will be conducted virtually, and we plan to host a full Investor Day in spring 2021, hopefully in person, to share more on the business outlook and key drivers of our long-term growth model. Further details will be shared soon, and we hope you will join us. I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's second quarter 2020 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Each day, I'm inspired by the work our incredible associates do to bring to life our purpose, to feed the human spirit. I am proud of our dedicated associates who are serving our customers when they need us most. Our top priority is to provide a safe environment for associates and customers, and as the pandemic continues, we know that Kroger will continue to rise to meet the challenge.\n Six months into the pandemic, while there is still much we cannot predict, we still -- we have a greater clarity in many areas across the business. Since March, we have invested more than $1 billion to both reward our associates and to safeguard them and our customers through implementation of dozens of safety measures. The company's total COVID-19 incident rate continues to track meaningfully below the rate in surrounding communities where we operate. We have learned and continue to learn a lot while keeping our stores and supply chain open and serving America during the pandemic.\n We continue to play a key role in addressing the critical need to expand COVID-19 testing. The Kroger Health team facilitated more than 150,000 COVID-19 tests at walk-up and drive-thru locations across the country. Recently, Kroger Health announced the expansion of COVID-19 testing offerings at more than [ 220 clinic ] locations.\n As the nation prepares to enter the flu season, testing will become even more critical to help diagnose COVID-19 amidst potential similar symptoms. We announced earlier this week a comprehensive flu shot program designed to help Americans get their recommended vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Despite the pandemic-related challenges, we delivered extremely strong results in the second quarter. Customers are at the center of everything we do, and as a result, we are growing market share. Kroger's strong digital business is a key contributor to this growth as the investments made to expand our digital ecosystem are resonating with customers.\n Our results continue to show that Kroger is a trusted brand, and our customers choose to shop with us because they value the product quality and freshness, convenience and digital offerings that we provide. While we delayed certain cost-saving initiatives in the first quarter, as of the close of the second quarter, we are back on pace to achieve them.\n I continue to be proud of the way our associates have adapted and adopted to the new ways of working during the pandemic to continue to achieve strong results. We are more certain than ever that the strategic choices and investments made through Restock Kroger to execute against our competitive moats, fresh, our brand, personalization and seamless, have positioned us to meet the moment. We are also positioned to deliver 2020 and beyond for our customers, associates and shareholders as we believe a number of impacts of COVID will be structural and lasting.\n Our data insights show customers are rediscovering their passion for cooking at home and have an aspiration to eat more healthy foods as a result of COVID. When we talk to our customers, they tell us they plan to continue to prepare and eat more meals at home. As children return to school, many families are telling us they plan to make breakfast in the morning and prepare lunch for their children to take school.\n As we talk to other companies across America, we believe return to work will look very different with many employees working part of the week from home. And finally, while the full economic impact of COVID-19 is yet understood, our data shows that during the periods of lower economic activity, we see a structural shift from food consumed away from home to food consumed at home. All of these factors combined lead us to believe there will be more meals eaten at home or prepared at home for the foreseeable future.\n Now I'd like to walk you through some examples of how our competitive moats have positioned us for growth in the short and long term. Even before the pandemic, our digital business had become a tailwind. The pandemic certainly has accelerated customer preference for seamless offerings. Our customers are increasingly turning to our e-commerce solutions for their grocery and household essential needs. Many of our customers are ordering groceries online for the first time as a result of COVID-19, and the majority of them tell us they plan to continue to do so in the future.\n Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As a result, we have over 2,100 pickup locations and 2,400 delivery locations, reaching 98% of our customers with a seamless customer experience that combines the best of our physical stores with digital. Kroger was the first to integrate pickup and delivery into one seamless experience. These investments were especially timely as customer adoption of pickup and delivery has grown significantly during the pandemic.\n Kroger's digital ecosystem continues to expand and customers are increasingly engaging with us. For example, Home Chef is growing incredibly fast, no doubt accelerated by the food at home trend that we believe is a structural change. We also announced that Kroger Ship will expand to offer an extended ship-to-home assortment through a marketplace offering of third-party sellers. We will continue to expand our ecosystem over time.\n The Kroger technology and digital team continues to create innovative experiences that are changing the way we serve customers across America and was recognized for the third consecutive year as the best place to work in IT by Computerworld. This recognition is awarded to companies that have innovative industry-leading workspaces offering a great customer associate experience.\n As a result of the pandemic, we continue to see a slow return to normal from the shutdown period, resulting in fewer customer visits but increased basket size. Customers across the country are still staying home and cooking at home that is now part of their new routine. This makes our leadership position in fresh an even more important sales driver for Kroger. Customers rank our fresh departments higher than all of our big box competitors, and our fresh departments generated strong identical sales in the second quarter and gained market share.\n Our brands is also a key competitive moat for Kroger. We continue to meet the diverse needs of our customers with significant growth across the 3 largest brands. Our customers are eating more at home and we are seeing some customer segments trade up to the larger pack sizes as well as more premium quality foods and natural and organic foods.\n Our larger-sized big pack platform is up well over 50%. Private Selection is up over 17% and Simple Truth is up over 20% in the second quarter. Our brands continues to tap into emerging trends and evolving customer needs, delivering new flavors and innovative new items like the new plant-based Emerge grinds and patties, which launched in late 2019.\n A recent third-party industry study reconfirmed that Simple Truth is the most-loved natural and organic brand in the U.S. Simple Truth significantly outperformed competitors on strength of brand, which is a combination of awareness, willingness to recommend and strength as the driver of store selection. In continuing to exceed our customers' expectations of value and quality while also consistently delivering innovative new items our customers love, our brands remain one of our most powerful competitive advantages.\n Finally, personalization and data remains one of Kroger's key and core competitive moats. We use our data to understand what is most important to our customers and continued to offer promotions throughout the quarter. And we think it is an important component to continue to support as the pandemic continues and government stimulus benefits have expired.\n Many of our customers are experiencing some form of financial hardship that we expect to impact discretionary purchases and eating out. This is one of the unique capabilities of the Kroger ecosystem we can deliver for both customers on a budget and customers who are trading up to premium products and/or larger sizes.\n Turning now to partnerships. While COVID-19 has not necessarily changed how we think about our approach to e-commerce, it has accelerated our thinking about how our full evolution of seamless strategy, inclusive of Ocado. Ocado is a strategic partner of choice, delivering innovation and best-in-class experience and economic advantage through efficient fulfillment. We are confident the future of our ecosystem will incorporate a mix of capabilities and facilities ranging in sizes, and our network will flex as demand matures and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same-day or next-day delivery or pickup and customers or store replenishment.\n Ocado's model incorporates state-of-the-art automation and AI to expand Kroger's products to a larger footprint. And our model to deliver to customers is significantly less costly than our existing model. We are on track to open the first 2 sites in the spring of 2021.\n Developed talent is a driver of Restock Kroger, and we work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure and the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. We are focused on both developing, training and promoting internal talent and hiring external executives, both food industry and technology, which together drives our retail supermarket business and all of our businesses.\n Kroger has been investing to raise wages of our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, over the period of 2018 to 2020, Kroger will have invested an incremental $800 million in associate wage increases, and that is $300 million more than the original plan. As a result of this continuing investment, Kroger has increased its average hourly rate to over $15 per hour. And with our comprehensive and best-in-class benefits, including health care, paid time-off and retirement plans, our average hourly rate is over $20.\n As the largest traditional grocery retailer in America, Kroger is committed to being a force of good in the communities we serve. Our purpose to feed the human spirit continues to guide how we operate our business, care for our communities and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Last month, we released our 2020 ESG report, highlighting progress toward our sustainability goals. We are committed to continuing to integrate ESG metrics into our business strategy, driving shared value for our associates, customers, communities and company.\n We recently made the decision to contribute an additional $20 million split evenly between The Kroger Co. Foundation and the Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation. We also added $5 million to a fund created to support the advancement of racial equity and justice. We believe that it is vitally important to get resources to our communities as they continue to face hardships related to the pandemic, the economic downturn and racial injustice.\n Under Restock Kroger, we have made significant investments to establish a seamless digital ecosystem, strengthen our brands and our personalization capabilities and to enhance product freshness and quality. These investments, combined with how our associates have responded to the pandemic and customers eating more meals at home, give us confidence that Kroger's performance in both 2020 and 2021 will be even stronger than previously anticipated.\n I will now turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before getting into our business results, I wanted to echo Rodney's comments from earlier and say how extremely proud I am of our associates for continuing to serve our customers and communities throughout the pandemic. We remain committed to investing to ensure a safe environment for our associates and customers, and we will also continue to use our customer insights to invest in delivering greater value for customers in ways that are most relevant today and that build future loyalty.\n Results for the second quarter were strong and reinforce the strategic investments we have made over the last several years as part of Restock Kroger. The quarter turned out much better than we previously expected. This was due to several factors, including stronger sales results and disciplined balance between cost savings and investments while also managing cost inflation volatility in key fresh categories. Additionally, fuel performed better than predicted, and we were very pleased with our alternative profit results, which rebounded from COVID-19 impacts more quickly than anticipated.\n Now I'd like to provide further detail on second quarter performance. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.73 per diluted share, up 66% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 14.6% during the second quarter. Sales momentum continued from the first quarter with identical sales without fuel in June and July trending in the mid-teens. During our final period of the quarter, which runs from mid-July to mid-August, identical sales without fuel were 12.5% as we saw reduced government stimulus and SNAP funding and lower back-to-school activity.\n Digital sales grew 127% and contributing 4.4% to identical sales without fuel. New customer engagement and with our pickup and delivery services continued to grow and we continue to invest in the customer experience. This included offering fee-free pickup to provide more value for our customers in ways that are most relevant at this time.\n Our digital sales growth was profitable on an incremental basis, and we were pleased with the progress we made to improve profitability by reducing the cost to fulfill a pickup order during the quarter. We see a clear path to further improve digital profitability by leveraging our personalization tools to improve sales mix, continuing to reduce cost to fulfill an order via process improvements and automation and accelerating growth in media revenue generated from digital sales.\n Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the second quarter was $894 million, up 43% compared to the second quarter of 2019. We were pleased with the overall pass-through rate achieved from the elevated sales in the quarter, which, including the impact of digital growth and incremental costs associated with COVID-19, was approximately 10%. COVID-related cost investments in associate depreciation, cleaning, safety and supply chain totaled approximately $250 million in the quarter.\n Gross margin was 22.8% of sales for the second quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 5 basis points, primarily driven by sourcing efficiencies, sales leverage related to shrink, transportation and advertising costs plus growth in alternative profit streams. This was partially offset by price investments as we continued to invest in delivering greater value for customers and mix changes from lower relative sales in higher gross margin categories such as deli bakery.\n The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 61 basis points due to sales leverage and execution of Restock Kroger initiatives, partially offset by ongoing COVID-19 related costs mentioned earlier to protect the health and safety of our customers and associates. Rent and depreciation, excluding fuel, decreased 27 basis points due to sales leverage. We were very pleased with the progress on our Restock Kroger savings initiatives in the quarter and now expect to achieve the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020.\n Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. Compared to the first quarter and consistent with market trends, the decline in gallons slowed to around 15% in the second quarter. We remain well positioned with our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and market-leading reward program.\n The average retail price of fuel was $2.14 this quarter versus $2.71 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the second quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.35 in the same quarter last year. While fuel operating profit was $30 million lower than the same quarter last year, this was better than expected. For the remainder of 2020, we expect fuel profitability will continue to be a headwind compared to prior year as we cycle margins from 2019 and gallons continue to be impacted by COVID.\n Kroger's alternative profit model is built on a platform of leveraging supermarket traffic and data, with media and Kroger Personal Finance representing the largest contributors to growth in 2020. Thanks to our team's responsiveness to the challenges COVID has presented to our alternative profits portfolio, these businesses rebounded strongly in the second quarter, and we now expect growth approaching $100 million for the fiscal year 2020. We continue to believe alternative profit will be a major accelerator of our model in the future, and COVID-19 has not changed the long-term profit expectations previously shared as part of Restock Kroger.\n Kroger precision marketing drove tremendous acceleration in our media business in the second quarter. On the strength of growth in digital sales, digital customer engagement and new inventory, revenue growth doubled compared to the first quarter. In-store media also bounced back as stay-at-home orders were lifted in many of the communities we serve.\n Kroger Personal Finance experienced higher transactions in the second quarter compared to the first quarter as customer activity improved in gift cards, lottery and money services. While trends at KPF are improving, we continue to expect KPF profit will be lower than our original expectations for 2020 due to COVID-19.\n We continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. As you know, for the last decade or more, Kroger has sought opportunities to address the funding challenges facing the pension plans in which our associates participate. We believe challenges related to pension funding can be mitigated if plans are reviewed and addressed over time.\n Consistent with this effort, last month, we announced a tentative agreement to improve security of future retirement benefits of over 33,000 Kroger family of company associates across 20 local UFCW unions with an investment of nearly $1 billion. Ratification of this agreement is still expected to occur in the third quarter of 2020.\n We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in [ Roadie ] during the second quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Little Rock, Houston, Dallas and Charleston, West Virginia. Looking ahead, towards the end of this year, we will be negotiating with the UFCW for Fry's stores associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.\n Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us to create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\n Turning now to financial strategy. Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain strong liquidity. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintaining our investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend over time. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to achieve consistently attractive total shareholder returns. We will provide more color on our future approach to capital allocation and the use of excess cash during our March 2021 Investor Day.\n In 2020, we are being disciplined in how we deploy capital, and all aspects of our capital plan are being evaluated to make sure that our investments will deliver strong returns and position Kroger for long-term success post COVID-19. We now expect total capital expenditure to range between $3 billion and $3.4 billion in 2020. We have widened the range of our guidance due to the uncertainty on timing of when spend will occur because of COVID-19.\n Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.7 compared to 2.46 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Kroger held temporary cash investments of approximately $2.4 billion as of the end of the quarter, reflecting improvements in operating performance, significant improvements in working capital and delayed tax payments as a result of the CARES Act. We expect working capital to improve for the year although not to the level experienced year-to-date, which is inflated by sales growth due to COVID-19.\n During the quarter, Kroger repurchased $211 million of shares under its $1 billion Board authorization announced on November 5, 2019. On September 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, replacing the prior authorization. In June, Kroger increased the dividend by 13%, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases.\n Turning now to guidance for the remainder of 2020. As we shared last quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the outlook for food retail, and we continued to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. While there are clearly still many unknowns, as Rodney shared in his opening comments, we now have greater clarity in many areas of our business and the drivers of food at home consumption.\n As a result of our strong performance in the first half of the year, the expectation of sustained trends in food-at-home consumption and confidence in our ability to execute against the Restock Kroger strategy, we are updating our full year 2020 guidance. For the full year 2020, we expect total identical sales without fuel to exceed 13%, and we expect to achieve adjusted EPS growth of approximately 45% to 50%. We are providing a wider range on guidance than we would normally provide at this point in the year to account for the variety of outcomes that could materialize as a result of the pandemic.\n In the second half of 2020, we expect identical sales, excluding fuel, to continue at elevated levels, although tapering from the level we've experienced so far this year. Our guidance contemplates continued investments in the customer and ongoing COVID-19 related costs to protect the safety of our customers and associates, balanced with continued execution of cost-saving initiatives and growth in alternative profits. We expect fuel profitability will be a headwind for the remainder of 2020.\n Finally, relative to delivering on our total shareholder return growth targets, as shared at our November 2019 Investor Day, these factors also lead us to believe that our 2021 business results will be higher than we would have expected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the operating environment continues to evolve, we will be transparent and communicate any important changes that could impact our outlook.\n I'll now turn it back to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. We provided specific guidance to help you understand how we see the business today. While there are still a lot of uncertainties, we are confident in our team's ability to navigate through this. We are laser-focused on winning with the customer, and our true measure of success internally will be growing market share sustainably over time.\n As Rebekah said earlier, we have scheduled a call on October 27. We will provide a business update relative to our November 2019 business commitments as well as our overall ESG commitments. We value the impact of an in-person meeting with you and have made the decision to reschedule the timing of our traditional Investor Day to spring of 2021.\n We remain incredibly confident in both our business model and TSR model and believe that not only 2020 will be strong, but as Gary mentioned, 2021 will be even stronger than we previously anticipated. Now we look forward to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. \nSpencer Hanus: This is actually Spencer Hanus on for Greg. My first question is just, can you talk about the comp trends that you guys are seeing quarter-to-date? And then we've seen ticket growth outpacing traffic growth as consumers combined trips. When do you think ticket and traffic trends get more normalized? \nW. McMullen: The -- in terms of where we are quarter-to-date, we would still be slightly ahead of double digits. And if you look at -- when traffic returns to normal, it's kind of fascinating. As you look at markets where COVID incident rates are lower or less severe, what we find are people start visiting the store more often but they don't spend as much. But if you look at overall, the trends are pretty similar.\n That's probably really the only insight that we have at this point. We do find everything that we can tell, people are enjoying cooking at home, enjoying eating as a family. And those are things that we believe will last past COVID. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? \nGary Millerchip: No. I think you covered it well, Rodney. I think we are seeing some gradual sort of, I guess, this return to patterns that customers get comfortable with in a COVID environment as -- continue to see large basket sizes and fewer trips, but we've been encouraged certainly in the second quarter by, well, categories like deli, bakery would be significantly lower than the heightened levels of sales we'd have seen in the last quarter or so from categories like grocery and meat and produce.\n Deli, bakery is positive again, which I think shows that customers are starting to at least return to some of those behaviors and certainly in areas like specialty cheese and floral. It's really encouraging to see those categories turning to sort of low to mid-single-digit ID sales as well. \nSpencer Hanus: That's really helpful. And then in your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that digital sales were profitable on an incremental basis. Can you provide some more color on that comment? And then how do you expect the launch of a marketplace with Kroger Ship to impact the profitability of the online business? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question. So the way we think about digital profitability is -- I know we've shared some of this color before, but essentially, we track very closely how a power customer behaves and when they engage digitally, and we see a significant level of incremental sales overall in the customer relationship. Obviously, you have to offset that against the incremental costs that we incur in filling the order for the customer.\n And in addition to that, then, of course, we're now seeing tremendous growth in digital media revenue that's generated off of a customer spending dollars with us digitally because we can then truly personalize the communication to the customer, and we can close the loop for a CPG partner in understanding whether that advertising led to a sale with the customer themselves.\n So when we look at the overall impact of the incremental sales, the cost to fill the order and the media revenue, we see a profitability pass-through, if you like, in terms of the transaction from a digital perspective. It's obviously at a much lower level than you would see in the store channel, but we are seeing that profitability flow through on an incremental basis.\n We believe that there's significant opportunities, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, to continue to improve that profitability. The first would be improving sales mix, and we believe there's a lot of opportunity using our personalization tools to do that. Marketplace would be a good example that -- well, also opportunity to do that as well. So that would be a part of that component where we think continuing to improve the basket size and the type of products the customer has in the basket is definitely going to be a driver of bridging any gap between store and digital profitability.\n Beyond that, we also believe there's significant opportunity to improve profitability by continuing to reduce the cost to fill an order through automation and process improvement and continuing to grow those digital media dollars. In the short term, we have plans on those areas today. And then, of course, as Rodney shared on the call earlier, Ocado would also be a significant accelerator of those drivers by further improving the customer experience to improve mix and continuing to take more cost out of the model through automation and AI. \nW. McMullen: Just to add a little bit, and everybody's heard me say this before, but when you look at digital overall, we've always viewed our first job is to make sure we don't lose the customer. And obviously, with our teams, they've done a fantastic job of supporting amazing growth, and that's our technology team, our digital team, our store teams and warehouse.\n We can now see a clear path to profitability of that. And one of the insights that Gary just shared in terms of the incremental is one piece of that path to profitability. Obviously, all the things that we're working on together, what we're expecting of ourselves is we will get to the point where we're indifferent if a customer connects with us digitally or a physical store. And everything that we can see, the customer actually will do both. And we made great progress on reducing cost to serve on a per customer basis. And then if you look at some of the other pieces of our digital offering like Home Chef, Home Chef had an incredible quarter, both sales growth and profitability as well. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So Rodney, you mentioned you took share in fresh. How do you think your share in other categories trended? And can you give us more detail behind your decision to reengage in price investments during the period? I think that was something that -- or at least promotions were put on hold in the prior period. It sounds like the overall environment has gotten a bit more competitive in the most recent period. Is that fair? \nW. McMullen: No. I would say a little differently. We've promoted throughout the pandemic. Now we did change what we promoted because obviously, you want to promote what you have, so we would have not promoted paper towels and toilet paper and certain meat items and things like that because just the availability of supply. But we've had promotions throughout the pandemic and it's really on the things that matter.\n We continue to invest in price, and we think it's really important that we think customers will look at it reflectively that we've been there to support them throughout to help them stretch their budgets. So the -- as Gary mentioned, waiving the pickup fee, continuing to invest in promotions, continuing to invest in price, all of those are things that we believe will pay off. Our customers will reward us for what we're doing over time. On market share, I specifically talked about fresh, but we continue to gain share in the center store, fresh and all areas of the store, and our own brands continue to gain share as well. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. And so you mentioned the final period of the quarter was -- IDs were up about 12%. It sounds like it slowed a little bit in the most recent period. Would you attribute that to some of the change in unemployment benefits in staff and continued pressure from back to school? And how does that back-to-school pressure manifest? \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the back to school, there's a lot of moving parts and we think that's part of it. We also think if you look at the holidays, people celebrate holidays differently. If you look at some of the sporting events, people are celebrating those differently. So there's a lot of moving parts, so I think it's hard to say the specifics. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think it's an interesting time right now, to Rodney's point, because we look at the trend in markets where we try and correlate results to higher levels of COVID cases, and it's become a lot more difficult to really track those trends. There's certainly a small level of correlation, it seems like, between the higher markets with COVID cases and the differentiation where you've got states and markets that have smaller levels of cases. But that being said, it seems like, to Rodney's point, I think more of the trends are being as customers are now adapting to some level of a new normal. And so as you mentioned, Michael, things like back to school certainly impacts for a period of time. I think the government's [ now followed ] in the market. We would say we saw a change there in the final period of the prior quarter and a little bit in this quarter.\n But then it's like what's the next trigger. So as now we're coming through the back-to-school campaign, what will happen in the final part of the year as maybe customers are less willing to eat out at restaurants in the cold and if capacity is still constrained in restaurants. I share that just because I think there's going to be almost different triggers that it's less, in some ways, what we're seeing in the trends around what's happening with COVID cases, but more about how our customers are adapting to what's the new theme and the new event that causes them to change shopping behavior. I think there's multiple different factors that are going on with the customer. And I think that the combination of all those of what led to, I think, the slightly different trajectory compared to the first 2 parts of quarter 2. \nOperator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Goldman: Two for me. First, I wanted to see if you've seen any notable changes in your product sales mix since the stimulus checks have run out. At least in the scanner data that we can see, store brands are still losing a lot of share within the measured grocery channel. But I'm not sure if that sort of corresponds with exactly what you're seeing. I might have expected store brands to do a little bit better right now overall. But I'm just curious if maybe you're seeing anything that's changing in there more recently. \nW. McMullen: Ken, I wouldn't say that we're seeing anything that's massive type trends. If you look at during the quarter, we would have seen better sales growth in CPG brands than own brands. But if you look at own brands overall, they continue to gain share relative to the market. The -- you continue to see behavior changes based on what's going on in people's lives, but you still see people aggressively -- alcohol sales are very strong, beer and wine is very strong. If you look at big pack, sales are strong. If you look at premium products, sales are strong. So you continue to see people trading up in places where they want to. If you look at, as Gary mentioned, deli, bakery, continue to make progress. So it's -- I love the question, but I think it's still hard to give a specific answer. \nKenneth Goldman: No, I understand. And then my follow-up, your FIFO gross margin ex fuel in the first quarter was up, I think, 46 basis points year-on-year. It was up still this quarter, but to your point, it was up less, I think, 5 was the number. Gary, I think you were very clear highlighting price investments as one of the reasons for that deceleration.\n I just would love to get a sense of what you're looking at for that number going ahead, whether we should be sort of thinking about in our models something closer to the first quarter or something closer to the second in terms of year-on-year. And I know there's all sorts of puts and takes and that's a very difficult one to answer. I'm just trying to sort of poke around a bit and see what you might think about that. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think -- thanks for the question, Ken. I think as we've shared kind of consistently, our goal is really to be balanced in the business model and continue to balance the investments we'll be making in supporting the customer, which is certainly our continued intent with the savings that we achieved through sourcing benefits and then, of course, alternative profit being accelerator of gross margin as well.\n In the quarter itself, where a lot of the focus for us was, as Rodney mentioned, the fee-free pickup is an important part of value for the customer. And we believe our digital sales relative to the more traditional grocery sector is pretty high. And so that's a bigger influence in our numbers, and we believe we gained market share in digital as well during the quarter. So that, I think, influences the level of investment, for one thing.\n I think the second part is fresh department's inflation was pretty volatile during the quarter, and we saw certainly a [ mean time ] inflation and in meat, produce and deli, bakery, cost inflation would have been higher than retail as we were investing in supporting the customer through the volatility in price and making sure we were building long-term loyalty.\n So I think we continue to be expecting to invest where it makes sense for the customer, but we feel very confident in our ability to balance those investments with cost savings through Restock Kroger, sourcing benefits and continuing to see leverage in things like shrink, warehouse and transportation and advertising. So I think the key message from us would be balanced and very consistent with the long-term growth model that we shared. \nOperator: The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So I want to start off, I guess, with just your capacity on click-and-collect. I was just curious where you guys are today from meeting all the demand out there for click-and-collect. And then related to that, I was also curious whether you think the removal of the pickup -- or the temporary removal of pickup for you is contributing to some of the share gains you're seeing? \nW. McMullen: Yes. In terms of capacity, we're constantly adjusting the capacity during the day because as people get used to the new normal, the times they want pickup slots constantly change. It's one area where I've been super proud of our teams, both stores and our data and technology and operations team in that constant adjusting and incrementally hiring people. There are stores now where we're aggressively investing a little bit of capital to be able to expand what's available within that store, and when we do that, that will allow us to add slots as well. So I would say the constraints on slots would be a slight opportunity, but I think the teams have done a great job of continuing to expand.\n The removal of the fee for a pickup, the temporary removal, is we look at it more in terms of trying to help a customer stretch their budget and try to be helpful in this environment. Customers still tell us the reason they like our pickup experience is really the freshness of our products and the quality of that and the assortment that we offer. So it probably helps, but I think it's more driven by the experience in the fresh side than waiving the fee. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then I guess one quick follow-up for Gary. What's the right way to think about COVID expenses in the back half of the year? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think we wouldn't get into specific numbers, but obviously, we did give you some color on the expense that we saw in Q2. Certainly, we would expect to be able to continue to optimize our operating plan, so we'd expect to provide continued efficiency in some of those plans that we execute on, and certainly, that was the case if you think about our investment in Q1 to Q2 as we're transitioning through the year and learning more and able to optimize our approach.\n That being said, one of the reasons that cost would have been probably a little bit higher than we originally thought in Q2 was that during the quarter, if you recall, many states, if not all the states we now operate in, are mandating masks, and we decided to adopt that proactively before it happened in many states to really reinforce the importance of safety in our stores and providing the inventory for masks to make sure that during that transition, all of our customers were able to have access to a mask as a new cost, if you like, that we incurred.\n So we're being very dynamic in the way we're managing those costs to make sure that we're, first and foremost, maintaining safety, and then secondly, obviously, being as efficient as we can be. But we feel very confident in our ability to manage and balance those costs with the incremental cost savings that we're achieving in our original model.\n And as I shared in the prepared comments, we've been -- the team has done a phenomenal job in really adapting and adjusting our cost saving plans in light of COVID. And whereas in Q1, we announced that we may have some headwinds on the original $1 billion. We feel confident now we can achieve those. So overall, there'll certainly be those ongoing investments, but we feel confident in our ability to be able to manage them. \nOperator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: Just actually on the gross margin, I had one quick follow-up and then I had a bigger question. Can you just give a little color on selling gross margins? I know that's not a topic that we've -- you've talked about on a consistent basis, but I think it would just help from the context of -- you said it drives customer loyalty to continue to promote during this time period and a lot of your competitors are not promoting. So I was wondering if you could give a little color on selling gross margins this quarter versus the first quarter. \nGary Millerchip: Well, certainly, Karen, thanks for the question. It would have been an investment. As you are aware from what we shared in the first quarter, we saw significant benefit in expensing gross sales leverage across warehouse and transportation, across shrink and also across advertising. And while sales obviously tapered in Q2 versus Q1, we would continue to have seen selling -- expecting growth, I'm sorry, leverage on our overall sales results. So to be at 5 percent -- basis point improvement overall on gross margin, that would reflect the fact we invested in our selling growth rate during the quarter.\n In the areas that I mentioned around continued acceleration of digital pickup, particularly in the fresh categories to make sure we're delivering value for our customers. And then there would also be, I think, an element that's important to mention, mix and the fact that with deli, bakery being a lower factor in the overall sales growth would also have brought down the selling growth rate somewhat as well. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then I wanted to just shift gears to digital for a second. So it looks -- I mean you can kind of back into e-com being around the 7%-ish of sales range now. So first, is that accurate? And then I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of a split or a split between what pickup is and versus delivery within that. And then I was wondering if you could give a little more color in terms of basket on each of the different like in-store versus pickup versus delivery. And then last portion of that is just any color on the new customers that you're gaining with respect to digital. \nW. McMullen: If you look at -- our percent of sales would be a little bit higher than your estimate. If you look at mix between pickup and delivery, it's still predominantly pickup. And we find customers find pickup incredibly flexible on their schedule, much more so than delivery, and that's the reason why they continue to like pickup in a good way. If you look at basket size, basket size would be significantly bigger on pickup versus in-store and pickup and delivery would be pretty similar.\n On new customers, we're finding -- we're getting a lot of new customers, both in-store and digital both and probably the biggest change for both of those groups. We -- in the past, a new customer would have to earn their right to start getting loyal customer mailings and digital offers and things like that. During this, we've started treating customers as loyal shoppers immediately rather than waiting for them to engage with us for a period of time. And what we're finding is we're having success on retaining those customers and repeat purchases as well. \nGary Millerchip: Maybe I can help you with that, Karen, on the comment about pickup and delivery. As Rodney mentioned, pickup is a significantly larger portion of the overall volume. I would say both of them are growing triple digits, so we are seeing very strong growth in both, but there isn't like a major change in the mix, if you like. Both have continued to grow significantly in the COVID period. \nOperator: Your next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Global Research. \nRobert Ohmes: Rodney, I was hoping, as a follow-up to Karen's question, can you give us more color kind of on what you're doing with Ocado versus the original plan? And maybe a little more color on kind of signposts we should be looking for in the back half and into next year on Ocado? And then just a separate question. Can you guys just give us color on what happened Labor Day weekend for you guys and how that was or was not similar to last year, et cetera? \nW. McMullen: Yes. I'll answer Ocado, and Gary, I'll let you talk about the Labor Day weekend. When we have our investor meeting in March, we'll get into a lot more details on Ocado. If you look at, obviously, the first initial part of the 2 first sheds that we'll open in Monroe, Ohio and in Florida, we'll be just scaling it and the assortment that customers have a desire for in that offering versus some other offerings. Those are 2 key parts.\n We will get into specific signposts in terms of how to hold us accountable. We're using the learnings from Ocado in terms of what they have in the U.K., obviously in Canada and France. And it will be taking all of those learnings and then making sure we manage the cost of the start-up as well. So we're excited. We can't wait and we wish they would have opened a year ago. \nGary Millerchip: And then Robby, on your second question, I would say, probably the broader comment I would make is Rodney shared, we're still trending in double-digit sales in the early part of the current quarter. It's a pretty difficult period to read, actually. It's probably the most important point, I would say, because the Labor Day weekend changed by a week, but we're also cycling weather from last year and then having some weather in this year. So it's been a really interesting, I would say, ride for the first 4 weeks of the new quarter and trying to interpret what's going on.\n If we look at the cycling and adjusting for the weeks, I wouldn't say we really saw anything materially unusual out of Labor Day, except for some of the weather events in certain markets adding some complexity to the data. But overall, as we're coming out the other side of that, as Rodney mentioned, trending in the low double digit early part of the quarter. \nRobert Ohmes: That's helpful. And then one quick just follow-up on digital in those markets where people are coming back into stores. Is it -- do you see a significant falloff in digital? And would it be coming more from delivery or more from pickup? \nW. McMullen: The mix between pickup and delivery is more driven by available slots. We do not -- the growth, it's still triple-digit growth but it would be a little bit slower growth, but it's still meaningful growth. \nOperator: The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Good quarter, by the way. I feel for you guys on the gross margin, by the way, and I wanted to follow up on this because I think there's been some criticism in the market that your gross margin was not up as much as the sell side was modeling. But you're probably doing what you should with this windfall, right? You're investing in price, still delivered a large EPS beat. Others are not investing.\n So I'm kind of curious, what are you seeing from a price gap standpoint in the marketplace currently, both versus like bigger discount players like Walmart but also your conventional players who maybe seem to be taking advantage of the current environment. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. I think you summarized it well. From our perspective, we believe it's very important that we continue to deliver value for customers and we're staying very true to that plan. And when we look at prices, as we've shared a couple of examples on the call, for us, it's not just about everyday low price but it's about the promotional plan, it's about the investment in digital. And we feel like we're on a very clear path to deliver value for the customer that will drive long-term loyalty.\n The way that our customers, when we talk to them and how we look at our data and measure value, we feel very good about the position that we're in, and our customers tell us we're delivering strong value to them. And we believe really kind of linked a little bit, I think to Rodney's comment, about how we think about setting up 2021 and making sure that we're winning long-term market share and growing our business so that the -- as things cycle through the pandemic, we end in a stronger position than we would have done prior to COVID-19 is really the journey that we believe we're on to make sure that we continue to connect more deeper with customers and drive value. We feel good about the journey and the results that we're achieving. We feel it's setting us up for the ability to be able to sustain that long-term growth in the future and as [ Rodney mentioned ]. \nEdward Kelly: Can I just follow up, Gary, by the way? When you look at the gross margin, we have heard from one of your peers that the end of May, June period was tougher because there was inflation in some of your categories, particularly protein. Was there anything about the cadence of the gross margin this quarter that was notable? Was it softer earlier on? \nGary Millerchip: It certainly -- there's been a lot of dynamic changes in some of those fresh categories as I mentioned earlier ahead that we have to manage through. And I think the team did a phenomenal job in doing that and making sure that we help our customers navigate through that. So certainly, the -- we would just experience some of those same elements to manage during the early part of the quarter, which would have impacted at that point. But I think your initial question is the more important one of how we are thinking about balancing and investing in the business to make sure that we're delivering long-term growth. I wouldn't say that it affects how we think about how we're managing the business for the future. \nW. McMullen: To me, overall, Gary's last point is the critical one. We really are looking at everything in terms of what will connect us with the customer and position us best for sustainable growth over time and continue to gain market share. And we're -- and that's what we're doing. Obviously, we were able to continue to manage expenses very well as well, which gave us the capacity to invest as well. \nRebekah Manis: And we have time for one last question. \nOperator: And that question will come from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. \nKelly Bania: Was curious if we could talk a little bit about just price inflation mix and tonnage. I know there's been a lot of comments about traffic and basket. But I think the way that you guys tend to look at it is more tonnage. And so just curious if you can help us understand how that's played out in the quarter and what you're thinking about into the back half as you think about that kind of high single-digit ID outlook there between price inflation and tonnage. \nW. McMullen: We -- tonnage would continue to be strong. We have -- we're still continuing to -- if you look at our supply chain, our team has done a nice job of identifying other sources of capacity. And we are -- have access to warehouses both that we manage on a temporary basis and others that continue to support and manage the tonnage.\n For me, the thing I find exciting about the tonnage is it's across the whole store. So tonnage growth is strong in center store, it's strong in produce, it's strong in meat, in all areas. So -- and obviously, in terms of the guidance that Gary gave for the rest of the year, we would expect that to continue.\n We continue to expect cost inflation will be a little bit more than retail inflation. And those are categories where it's more driven by short-term things. If you look at meat, we would expect meat inflation to be more normalized, and as it more normalizes, then you would see our balance between the 2 very close. \nGary Millerchip: Just maybe add to Rodney's comments on tonnage, it ties a little bit back to Rodney's comments on market share as well that we're certainly focused on, as Rodney mentioned, our most important measure of success on sales growth is obviously growing market share. And we look at that very closely through tonnage and units as much as we do through dollars because of the -- again, making sure that we're investing in the customer, and we're certainly pleased with our tonnage market share growth as well as the dollar market share growth during the quarter.\n And then, as Rodney mentioned, Kelly, we've -- I think you've heard us say this before, but we generally build our model off of the 0.5% to 1% inflation. We'd certainly be running a bit ahead of that when you think about cost inflation, as Rodney mentioned earlier, with meat in particular being high but grocery would be probably a little bit north of 2% as well right now based on some of the trends that we're seeing. \nKelly Bania: Okay, that's very helpful. And then if I can just ask 2 quick follow-up ones related to digital. I think I heard you mention regarding the pickup fee that, that was a temporary removal. And I guess I was just curious under what circumstances or time frame would you consider bringing that back? Or is that a market-by-market specific thought process?\n And also, maybe just thoughts on membership. Obviously, a lot of competitive developments with membership and in terms of digital, whether pickup or delivery. So just curious if you're in any way thinking of evolving into something like a membership program over time. \nW. McMullen: Yes. On the digital fee, it really -- at the moment, we put it in place just trying to help our customers and especially customers on a budget to help them stretch their weekly spending. And what we would do over time, we -- at this point, we really haven't decided, but it's part of the overall value equation that we're providing to customers.\n On membership, as you know, we continually and have been, for a while, testing various types of membership programs. And when we find a membership program that really works, you'll see us continuing to be more aggressive with it. As everybody on the call knows, we've had a membership program in terms of fuel rewards for years. Now customers don't have to pay for that, and they get the rewards incrementally for free, obviously, and that's something that's been very successful and very successful on sharing value with customers and creating additional customer loyalty, which is something that we've done for several years.\n So thanks, Kelly, for your questions, and thanks to everyone for your questions. Before we close today, I'd like to start with just a moment of silence and remembrance of the lives lost during the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001.\n Thank you. As you know, I usually take time before we end our call to share a few final comments directed toward our associates. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge and change our country, not the least of which is the loss of lives in America and around the world. I appreciate our associates for doing their part to keep our customers and each other safe, especially for leading by example by consistently wearing masks.\n We are incredibly confident in terms of the future and the things that we do to take care of our associates and customers. And together, we will get through COVID-19. Thank you for your time today, and have a great weekend. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's second quarter 2020 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Each day, I'm inspired by the work our incredible associates do to bring to life our purpose, to feed the human spirit. I am proud of our dedicated associates who are serving our customers when they need us most. Our top priority is to provide a safe environment for associates and customers, and as the pandemic continues, we know that Kroger will continue to rise to meet the challenge.\n Six months into the pandemic, while there is still much we cannot predict, we still -- we have a greater clarity in many areas across the business. Since March, we have invested more than $1 billion to both reward our associates and to safeguard them and our customers through implementation of dozens of safety measures. The company's total COVID-19 incident rate continues to track meaningfully below the rate in surrounding communities where we operate. We have learned and continue to learn a lot while keeping our stores and supply chain open and serving America during the pandemic.\n We continue to play a key role in addressing the critical need to expand COVID-19 testing. The Kroger Health team facilitated more than 150,000 COVID-19 tests at walk-up and drive-thru locations across the country. Recently, Kroger Health announced the expansion of COVID-19 testing offerings at more than [ 220 clinic ] locations.\n As the nation prepares to enter the flu season, testing will become even more critical to help diagnose COVID-19 amidst potential similar symptoms. We announced earlier this week a comprehensive flu shot program designed to help Americans get their recommended vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Despite the pandemic-related challenges, we delivered extremely strong results in the second quarter. Customers are at the center of everything we do, and as a result, we are growing market share. Kroger's strong digital business is a key contributor to this growth as the investments made to expand our digital ecosystem are resonating with customers.\n Our results continue to show that Kroger is a trusted brand, and our customers choose to shop with us because they value the product quality and freshness, convenience and digital offerings that we provide. While we delayed certain cost-saving initiatives in the first quarter, as of the close of the second quarter, we are back on pace to achieve them.\n I continue to be proud of the way our associates have adapted and adopted to the new ways of working during the pandemic to continue to achieve strong results. We are more certain than ever that the strategic choices and investments made through Restock Kroger to execute against our competitive moats, fresh, our brand, personalization and seamless, have positioned us to meet the moment. We are also positioned to deliver 2020 and beyond for our customers, associates and shareholders as we believe a number of impacts of COVID will be structural and lasting.\n Our data insights show customers are rediscovering their passion for cooking at home and have an aspiration to eat more healthy foods as a result of COVID. When we talk to our customers, they tell us they plan to continue to prepare and eat more meals at home. As children return to school, many families are telling us they plan to make breakfast in the morning and prepare lunch for their children to take school.\n As we talk to other companies across America, we believe return to work will look very different with many employees working part of the week from home. And finally, while the full economic impact of COVID-19 is yet understood, our data shows that during the periods of lower economic activity, we see a structural shift from food consumed away from home to food consumed at home. All of these factors combined lead us to believe there will be more meals eaten at home or prepared at home for the foreseeable future.\n Now I'd like to walk you through some examples of how our competitive moats have positioned us for growth in the short and long term. Even before the pandemic, our digital business had become a tailwind. The pandemic certainly has accelerated customer preference for seamless offerings. Our customers are increasingly turning to our e-commerce solutions for their grocery and household essential needs. Many of our customers are ordering groceries online for the first time as a result of COVID-19, and the majority of them tell us they plan to continue to do so in the future.\n Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As a result, we have over 2,100 pickup locations and 2,400 delivery locations, reaching 98% of our customers with a seamless customer experience that combines the best of our physical stores with digital. Kroger was the first to integrate pickup and delivery into one seamless experience. These investments were especially timely as customer adoption of pickup and delivery has grown significantly during the pandemic.\n Kroger's digital ecosystem continues to expand and customers are increasingly engaging with us. For example, Home Chef is growing incredibly fast, no doubt accelerated by the food at home trend that we believe is a structural change. We also announced that Kroger Ship will expand to offer an extended ship-to-home assortment through a marketplace offering of third-party sellers. We will continue to expand our ecosystem over time.\n The Kroger technology and digital team continues to create innovative experiences that are changing the way we serve customers across America and was recognized for the third consecutive year as the best place to work in IT by Computerworld. This recognition is awarded to companies that have innovative industry-leading workspaces offering a great customer associate experience.\n As a result of the pandemic, we continue to see a slow return to normal from the shutdown period, resulting in fewer customer visits but increased basket size. Customers across the country are still staying home and cooking at home that is now part of their new routine. This makes our leadership position in fresh an even more important sales driver for Kroger. Customers rank our fresh departments higher than all of our big box competitors, and our fresh departments generated strong identical sales in the second quarter and gained market share.\n Our brands is also a key competitive moat for Kroger. We continue to meet the diverse needs of our customers with significant growth across the 3 largest brands. Our customers are eating more at home and we are seeing some customer segments trade up to the larger pack sizes as well as more premium quality foods and natural and organic foods.\n Our larger-sized big pack platform is up well over 50%. Private Selection is up over 17% and Simple Truth is up over 20% in the second quarter. Our brands continues to tap into emerging trends and evolving customer needs, delivering new flavors and innovative new items like the new plant-based Emerge grinds and patties, which launched in late 2019.\n A recent third-party industry study reconfirmed that Simple Truth is the most-loved natural and organic brand in the U.S. Simple Truth significantly outperformed competitors on strength of brand, which is a combination of awareness, willingness to recommend and strength as the driver of store selection. In continuing to exceed our customers' expectations of value and quality while also consistently delivering innovative new items our customers love, our brands remain one of our most powerful competitive advantages.\n Finally, personalization and data remains one of Kroger's key and core competitive moats. We use our data to understand what is most important to our customers and continued to offer promotions throughout the quarter. And we think it is an important component to continue to support as the pandemic continues and government stimulus benefits have expired.\n Many of our customers are experiencing some form of financial hardship that we expect to impact discretionary purchases and eating out. This is one of the unique capabilities of the Kroger ecosystem we can deliver for both customers on a budget and customers who are trading up to premium products and/or larger sizes.\n Turning now to partnerships. While COVID-19 has not necessarily changed how we think about our approach to e-commerce, it has accelerated our thinking about how our full evolution of seamless strategy, inclusive of Ocado. Ocado is a strategic partner of choice, delivering innovation and best-in-class experience and economic advantage through efficient fulfillment. We are confident the future of our ecosystem will incorporate a mix of capabilities and facilities ranging in sizes, and our network will flex as demand matures and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same-day or next-day delivery or pickup and customers or store replenishment.\n Ocado's model incorporates state-of-the-art automation and AI to expand Kroger's products to a larger footprint. And our model to deliver to customers is significantly less costly than our existing model. We are on track to open the first 2 sites in the spring of 2021.\n Developed talent is a driver of Restock Kroger, and we work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure and the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. We are focused on both developing, training and promoting internal talent and hiring external executives, both food industry and technology, which together drives our retail supermarket business and all of our businesses.\n Kroger has been investing to raise wages of our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, over the period of 2018 to 2020, Kroger will have invested an incremental $800 million in associate wage increases, and that is $300 million more than the original plan. As a result of this continuing investment, Kroger has increased its average hourly rate to over $15 per hour. And with our comprehensive and best-in-class benefits, including health care, paid time-off and retirement plans, our average hourly rate is over $20.\n As the largest traditional grocery retailer in America, Kroger is committed to being a force of good in the communities we serve. Our purpose to feed the human spirit continues to guide how we operate our business, care for our communities and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Last month, we released our 2020 ESG report, highlighting progress toward our sustainability goals. We are committed to continuing to integrate ESG metrics into our business strategy, driving shared value for our associates, customers, communities and company.\n We recently made the decision to contribute an additional $20 million split evenly between The Kroger Co. Foundation and the Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation. We also added $5 million to a fund created to support the advancement of racial equity and justice. We believe that it is vitally important to get resources to our communities as they continue to face hardships related to the pandemic, the economic downturn and racial injustice.\n Under Restock Kroger, we have made significant investments to establish a seamless digital ecosystem, strengthen our brands and our personalization capabilities and to enhance product freshness and quality. These investments, combined with how our associates have responded to the pandemic and customers eating more meals at home, give us confidence that Kroger's performance in both 2020 and 2021 will be even stronger than previously anticipated.\n I will now turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? Thanks, Gary. We provided specific guidance to help you understand how we see the business today. While there are still a lot of uncertainties, we are confident in our team's ability to navigate through this. We are laser-focused on winning with the customer, and our true measure of success internally will be growing market share sustainably over time.\n As Rebekah said earlier, we have scheduled a call on October 27. We will provide a business update relative to our November 2019 business commitments as well as our overall ESG commitments. We value the impact of an in-person meeting with you and have made the decision to reschedule the timing of our traditional Investor Day to spring of 2021.\n We remain incredibly confident in both our business model and TSR model and believe that not only 2020 will be strong, but as Gary mentioned, 2021 will be even stronger than we previously anticipated. Now we look forward to your questions. The -- in terms of where we are quarter-to-date, we would still be slightly ahead of double digits. And if you look at -- when traffic returns to normal, it's kind of fascinating. As you look at markets where COVID incident rates are lower or less severe, what we find are people start visiting the store more often but they don't spend as much. But if you look at overall, the trends are pretty similar.\n That's probably really the only insight that we have at this point. We do find everything that we can tell, people are enjoying cooking at home, enjoying eating as a family. And those are things that we believe will last past COVID. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? Just to add a little bit, and everybody's heard me say this before, but when you look at digital overall, we've always viewed our first job is to make sure we don't lose the customer. And obviously, with our teams, they've done a fantastic job of supporting amazing growth, and that's our technology team, our digital team, our store teams and warehouse.\n We can now see a clear path to profitability of that. And one of the insights that Gary just shared in terms of the incremental is one piece of that path to profitability. Obviously, all the things that we're working on together, what we're expecting of ourselves is we will get to the point where we're indifferent if a customer connects with us digitally or a physical store. And everything that we can see, the customer actually will do both. And we made great progress on reducing cost to serve on a per customer basis. And then if you look at some of the other pieces of our digital offering like Home Chef, Home Chef had an incredible quarter, both sales growth and profitability as well. No. I would say a little differently. We've promoted throughout the pandemic. Now we did change what we promoted because obviously, you want to promote what you have, so we would have not promoted paper towels and toilet paper and certain meat items and things like that because just the availability of supply. But we've had promotions throughout the pandemic and it's really on the things that matter.\n We continue to invest in price, and we think it's really important that we think customers will look at it reflectively that we've been there to support them throughout to help them stretch their budgets. So the -- as Gary mentioned, waiving the pickup fee, continuing to invest in promotions, continuing to invest in price, all of those are things that we believe will pay off. Our customers will reward us for what we're doing over time. On market share, I specifically talked about fresh, but we continue to gain share in the center store, fresh and all areas of the store, and our own brands continue to gain share as well. Yes. If you look at the back to school, there's a lot of moving parts and we think that's part of it. We also think if you look at the holidays, people celebrate holidays differently. If you look at some of the sporting events, people are celebrating those differently. So there's a lot of moving parts, so I think it's hard to say the specifics. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? Ken, I wouldn't say that we're seeing anything that's massive type trends. If you look at during the quarter, we would have seen better sales growth in CPG brands than own brands. But if you look at own brands overall, they continue to gain share relative to the market. The -- you continue to see behavior changes based on what's going on in people's lives, but you still see people aggressively -- alcohol sales are very strong, beer and wine is very strong. If you look at big pack, sales are strong. If you look at premium products, sales are strong. So you continue to see people trading up in places where they want to. If you look at, as Gary mentioned, deli, bakery, continue to make progress. So it's -- I love the question, but I think it's still hard to give a specific answer. Yes. In terms of capacity, we're constantly adjusting the capacity during the day because as people get used to the new normal, the times they want pickup slots constantly change. It's one area where I've been super proud of our teams, both stores and our data and technology and operations team in that constant adjusting and incrementally hiring people. There are stores now where we're aggressively investing a little bit of capital to be able to expand what's available within that store, and when we do that, that will allow us to add slots as well. So I would say the constraints on slots would be a slight opportunity, but I think the teams have done a great job of continuing to expand.\n The removal of the fee for a pickup, the temporary removal, is we look at it more in terms of trying to help a customer stretch their budget and try to be helpful in this environment. Customers still tell us the reason they like our pickup experience is really the freshness of our products and the quality of that and the assortment that we offer. So it probably helps, but I think it's more driven by the experience in the fresh side than waiving the fee. If you look at -- our percent of sales would be a little bit higher than your estimate. If you look at mix between pickup and delivery, it's still predominantly pickup. And we find customers find pickup incredibly flexible on their schedule, much more so than delivery, and that's the reason why they continue to like pickup in a good way. If you look at basket size, basket size would be significantly bigger on pickup versus in-store and pickup and delivery would be pretty similar.\n On new customers, we're finding -- we're getting a lot of new customers, both in-store and digital both and probably the biggest change for both of those groups. We -- in the past, a new customer would have to earn their right to start getting loyal customer mailings and digital offers and things like that. During this, we've started treating customers as loyal shoppers immediately rather than waiting for them to engage with us for a period of time. And what we're finding is we're having success on retaining those customers and repeat purchases as well. Yes. I'll answer Ocado, and Gary, I'll let you talk about the Labor Day weekend. When we have our investor meeting in March, we'll get into a lot more details on Ocado. If you look at, obviously, the first initial part of the 2 first sheds that we'll open in Monroe, Ohio and in Florida, we'll be just scaling it and the assortment that customers have a desire for in that offering versus some other offerings. Those are 2 key parts.\n We will get into specific signposts in terms of how to hold us accountable. We're using the learnings from Ocado in terms of what they have in the U.K., obviously in Canada and France. And it will be taking all of those learnings and then making sure we manage the cost of the start-up as well. So we're excited. We can't wait and we wish they would have opened a year ago. The mix between pickup and delivery is more driven by available slots. We do not -- the growth, it's still triple-digit growth but it would be a little bit slower growth, but it's still meaningful growth. To me, overall, Gary's last point is the critical one. We really are looking at everything in terms of what will connect us with the customer and position us best for sustainable growth over time and continue to gain market share. And we're -- and that's what we're doing. Obviously, we were able to continue to manage expenses very well as well, which gave us the capacity to invest as well. We -- tonnage would continue to be strong. We have -- we're still continuing to -- if you look at our supply chain, our team has done a nice job of identifying other sources of capacity. And we are -- have access to warehouses both that we manage on a temporary basis and others that continue to support and manage the tonnage.\n For me, the thing I find exciting about the tonnage is it's across the whole store. So tonnage growth is strong in center store, it's strong in produce, it's strong in meat, in all areas. So -- and obviously, in terms of the guidance that Gary gave for the rest of the year, we would expect that to continue.\n We continue to expect cost inflation will be a little bit more than retail inflation. And those are categories where it's more driven by short-term things. If you look at meat, we would expect meat inflation to be more normalized, and as it more normalizes, then you would see our balance between the 2 very close. Yes. On the digital fee, it really -- at the moment, we put it in place just trying to help our customers and especially customers on a budget to help them stretch their weekly spending. And what we would do over time, we -- at this point, we really haven't decided, but it's part of the overall value equation that we're providing to customers.\n On membership, as you know, we continually and have been, for a while, testing various types of membership programs. And when we find a membership program that really works, you'll see us continuing to be more aggressive with it. As everybody on the call knows, we've had a membership program in terms of fuel rewards for years. Now customers don't have to pay for that, and they get the rewards incrementally for free, obviously, and that's something that's been very successful and very successful on sharing value with customers and creating additional customer loyalty, which is something that we've done for several years.\n So thanks, Kelly, for your questions, and thanks to everyone for your questions. Before we close today, I'd like to start with just a moment of silence and remembrance of the lives lost during the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001.\n Thank you. As you know, I usually take time before we end our call to share a few final comments directed toward our associates. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge and change our country, not the least of which is the loss of lives in America and around the world. I appreciate our associates for doing their part to keep our customers and each other safe, especially for leading by example by consistently wearing masks.\n We are incredibly confident in terms of the future and the things that we do to take care of our associates and customers. And together, we will get through COVID-19. Thank you for your time today, and have a great weekend."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before getting into our business results, I wanted to echo Rodney's comments from earlier and say how extremely proud I am of our associates for continuing to serve our customers and communities throughout the pandemic. We remain committed to investing to ensure a safe environment for our associates and customers, and we will also continue to use our customer insights to invest in delivering greater value for customers in ways that are most relevant today and that build future loyalty.\n Results for the second quarter were strong and reinforce the strategic investments we have made over the last several years as part of Restock Kroger. The quarter turned out much better than we previously expected. This was due to several factors, including stronger sales results and disciplined balance between cost savings and investments while also managing cost inflation volatility in key fresh categories. Additionally, fuel performed better than predicted, and we were very pleased with our alternative profit results, which rebounded from COVID-19 impacts more quickly than anticipated.\n Now I'd like to provide further detail on second quarter performance. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.73 per diluted share, up 66% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 14.6% during the second quarter. Sales momentum continued from the first quarter with identical sales without fuel in June and July trending in the mid-teens. During our final period of the quarter, which runs from mid-July to mid-August, identical sales without fuel were 12.5% as we saw reduced government stimulus and SNAP funding and lower back-to-school activity.\n Digital sales grew 127% and contributing 4.4% to identical sales without fuel. New customer engagement and with our pickup and delivery services continued to grow and we continue to invest in the customer experience. This included offering fee-free pickup to provide more value for our customers in ways that are most relevant at this time.\n Our digital sales growth was profitable on an incremental basis, and we were pleased with the progress we made to improve profitability by reducing the cost to fulfill a pickup order during the quarter. We see a clear path to further improve digital profitability by leveraging our personalization tools to improve sales mix, continuing to reduce cost to fulfill an order via process improvements and automation and accelerating growth in media revenue generated from digital sales.\n Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the second quarter was $894 million, up 43% compared to the second quarter of 2019. We were pleased with the overall pass-through rate achieved from the elevated sales in the quarter, which, including the impact of digital growth and incremental costs associated with COVID-19, was approximately 10%. COVID-related cost investments in associate depreciation, cleaning, safety and supply chain totaled approximately $250 million in the quarter.\n Gross margin was 22.8% of sales for the second quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 5 basis points, primarily driven by sourcing efficiencies, sales leverage related to shrink, transportation and advertising costs plus growth in alternative profit streams. This was partially offset by price investments as we continued to invest in delivering greater value for customers and mix changes from lower relative sales in higher gross margin categories such as deli bakery.\n The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 61 basis points due to sales leverage and execution of Restock Kroger initiatives, partially offset by ongoing COVID-19 related costs mentioned earlier to protect the health and safety of our customers and associates. Rent and depreciation, excluding fuel, decreased 27 basis points due to sales leverage. We were very pleased with the progress on our Restock Kroger savings initiatives in the quarter and now expect to achieve the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020.\n Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. Compared to the first quarter and consistent with market trends, the decline in gallons slowed to around 15% in the second quarter. We remain well positioned with our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and market-leading reward program.\n The average retail price of fuel was $2.14 this quarter versus $2.71 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the second quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.35 in the same quarter last year. While fuel operating profit was $30 million lower than the same quarter last year, this was better than expected. For the remainder of 2020, we expect fuel profitability will continue to be a headwind compared to prior year as we cycle margins from 2019 and gallons continue to be impacted by COVID.\n Kroger's alternative profit model is built on a platform of leveraging supermarket traffic and data, with media and Kroger Personal Finance representing the largest contributors to growth in 2020. Thanks to our team's responsiveness to the challenges COVID has presented to our alternative profits portfolio, these businesses rebounded strongly in the second quarter, and we now expect growth approaching $100 million for the fiscal year 2020. We continue to believe alternative profit will be a major accelerator of our model in the future, and COVID-19 has not changed the long-term profit expectations previously shared as part of Restock Kroger.\n Kroger precision marketing drove tremendous acceleration in our media business in the second quarter. On the strength of growth in digital sales, digital customer engagement and new inventory, revenue growth doubled compared to the first quarter. In-store media also bounced back as stay-at-home orders were lifted in many of the communities we serve.\n Kroger Personal Finance experienced higher transactions in the second quarter compared to the first quarter as customer activity improved in gift cards, lottery and money services. While trends at KPF are improving, we continue to expect KPF profit will be lower than our original expectations for 2020 due to COVID-19.\n We continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. As you know, for the last decade or more, Kroger has sought opportunities to address the funding challenges facing the pension plans in which our associates participate. We believe challenges related to pension funding can be mitigated if plans are reviewed and addressed over time.\n Consistent with this effort, last month, we announced a tentative agreement to improve security of future retirement benefits of over 33,000 Kroger family of company associates across 20 local UFCW unions with an investment of nearly $1 billion. Ratification of this agreement is still expected to occur in the third quarter of 2020.\n We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in [ Roadie ] during the second quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Little Rock, Houston, Dallas and Charleston, West Virginia. Looking ahead, towards the end of this year, we will be negotiating with the UFCW for Fry's stores associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.\n Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us to create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\n Turning now to financial strategy. Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain strong liquidity. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintaining our investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend over time. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to achieve consistently attractive total shareholder returns. We will provide more color on our future approach to capital allocation and the use of excess cash during our March 2021 Investor Day.\n In 2020, we are being disciplined in how we deploy capital, and all aspects of our capital plan are being evaluated to make sure that our investments will deliver strong returns and position Kroger for long-term success post COVID-19. We now expect total capital expenditure to range between $3 billion and $3.4 billion in 2020. We have widened the range of our guidance due to the uncertainty on timing of when spend will occur because of COVID-19.\n Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.7 compared to 2.46 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Kroger held temporary cash investments of approximately $2.4 billion as of the end of the quarter, reflecting improvements in operating performance, significant improvements in working capital and delayed tax payments as a result of the CARES Act. We expect working capital to improve for the year although not to the level experienced year-to-date, which is inflated by sales growth due to COVID-19.\n During the quarter, Kroger repurchased $211 million of shares under its $1 billion Board authorization announced on November 5, 2019. On September 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, replacing the prior authorization. In June, Kroger increased the dividend by 13%, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases.\n Turning now to guidance for the remainder of 2020. As we shared last quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the outlook for food retail, and we continued to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. While there are clearly still many unknowns, as Rodney shared in his opening comments, we now have greater clarity in many areas of our business and the drivers of food at home consumption.\n As a result of our strong performance in the first half of the year, the expectation of sustained trends in food-at-home consumption and confidence in our ability to execute against the Restock Kroger strategy, we are updating our full year 2020 guidance. For the full year 2020, we expect total identical sales without fuel to exceed 13%, and we expect to achieve adjusted EPS growth of approximately 45% to 50%. We are providing a wider range on guidance than we would normally provide at this point in the year to account for the variety of outcomes that could materialize as a result of the pandemic.\n In the second half of 2020, we expect identical sales, excluding fuel, to continue at elevated levels, although tapering from the level we've experienced so far this year. Our guidance contemplates continued investments in the customer and ongoing COVID-19 related costs to protect the safety of our customers and associates, balanced with continued execution of cost-saving initiatives and growth in alternative profits. We expect fuel profitability will be a headwind for the remainder of 2020.\n Finally, relative to delivering on our total shareholder return growth targets, as shared at our November 2019 Investor Day, these factors also lead us to believe that our 2021 business results will be higher than we would have expected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the operating environment continues to evolve, we will be transparent and communicate any important changes that could impact our outlook.\n I'll now turn it back to Rodney. No. I think you covered it well, Rodney. I think we are seeing some gradual sort of, I guess, this return to patterns that customers get comfortable with in a COVID environment as -- continue to see large basket sizes and fewer trips, but we've been encouraged certainly in the second quarter by, well, categories like deli, bakery would be significantly lower than the heightened levels of sales we'd have seen in the last quarter or so from categories like grocery and meat and produce.\n Deli, bakery is positive again, which I think shows that customers are starting to at least return to some of those behaviors and certainly in areas like specialty cheese and floral. It's really encouraging to see those categories turning to sort of low to mid-single-digit ID sales as well. Yes. Thanks for the question. So the way we think about digital profitability is -- I know we've shared some of this color before, but essentially, we track very closely how a power customer behaves and when they engage digitally, and we see a significant level of incremental sales overall in the customer relationship. Obviously, you have to offset that against the incremental costs that we incur in filling the order for the customer.\n And in addition to that, then, of course, we're now seeing tremendous growth in digital media revenue that's generated off of a customer spending dollars with us digitally because we can then truly personalize the communication to the customer, and we can close the loop for a CPG partner in understanding whether that advertising led to a sale with the customer themselves.\n So when we look at the overall impact of the incremental sales, the cost to fill the order and the media revenue, we see a profitability pass-through, if you like, in terms of the transaction from a digital perspective. It's obviously at a much lower level than you would see in the store channel, but we are seeing that profitability flow through on an incremental basis.\n We believe that there's significant opportunities, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, to continue to improve that profitability. The first would be improving sales mix, and we believe there's a lot of opportunity using our personalization tools to do that. Marketplace would be a good example that -- well, also opportunity to do that as well. So that would be a part of that component where we think continuing to improve the basket size and the type of products the customer has in the basket is definitely going to be a driver of bridging any gap between store and digital profitability.\n Beyond that, we also believe there's significant opportunity to improve profitability by continuing to reduce the cost to fill an order through automation and process improvement and continuing to grow those digital media dollars. In the short term, we have plans on those areas today. And then, of course, as Rodney shared on the call earlier, Ocado would also be a significant accelerator of those drivers by further improving the customer experience to improve mix and continuing to take more cost out of the model through automation and AI. Yes. I think it's an interesting time right now, to Rodney's point, because we look at the trend in markets where we try and correlate results to higher levels of COVID cases, and it's become a lot more difficult to really track those trends. There's certainly a small level of correlation, it seems like, between the higher markets with COVID cases and the differentiation where you've got states and markets that have smaller levels of cases. But that being said, it seems like, to Rodney's point, I think more of the trends are being as customers are now adapting to some level of a new normal. And so as you mentioned, Michael, things like back to school certainly impacts for a period of time. I think the government's [ now followed ] in the market. We would say we saw a change there in the final period of the prior quarter and a little bit in this quarter.\n But then it's like what's the next trigger. So as now we're coming through the back-to-school campaign, what will happen in the final part of the year as maybe customers are less willing to eat out at restaurants in the cold and if capacity is still constrained in restaurants. I share that just because I think there's going to be almost different triggers that it's less, in some ways, what we're seeing in the trends around what's happening with COVID cases, but more about how our customers are adapting to what's the new theme and the new event that causes them to change shopping behavior. I think there's multiple different factors that are going on with the customer. And I think that the combination of all those of what led to, I think, the slightly different trajectory compared to the first 2 parts of quarter 2. Yes. I think -- thanks for the question, Ken. I think as we've shared kind of consistently, our goal is really to be balanced in the business model and continue to balance the investments we'll be making in supporting the customer, which is certainly our continued intent with the savings that we achieved through sourcing benefits and then, of course, alternative profit being accelerator of gross margin as well.\n In the quarter itself, where a lot of the focus for us was, as Rodney mentioned, the fee-free pickup is an important part of value for the customer. And we believe our digital sales relative to the more traditional grocery sector is pretty high. And so that's a bigger influence in our numbers, and we believe we gained market share in digital as well during the quarter. So that, I think, influences the level of investment, for one thing.\n I think the second part is fresh department's inflation was pretty volatile during the quarter, and we saw certainly a [ mean time ] inflation and in meat, produce and deli, bakery, cost inflation would have been higher than retail as we were investing in supporting the customer through the volatility in price and making sure we were building long-term loyalty.\n So I think we continue to be expecting to invest where it makes sense for the customer, but we feel very confident in our ability to balance those investments with cost savings through Restock Kroger, sourcing benefits and continuing to see leverage in things like shrink, warehouse and transportation and advertising. So I think the key message from us would be balanced and very consistent with the long-term growth model that we shared. Yes. I think we wouldn't get into specific numbers, but obviously, we did give you some color on the expense that we saw in Q2. Certainly, we would expect to be able to continue to optimize our operating plan, so we'd expect to provide continued efficiency in some of those plans that we execute on, and certainly, that was the case if you think about our investment in Q1 to Q2 as we're transitioning through the year and learning more and able to optimize our approach.\n That being said, one of the reasons that cost would have been probably a little bit higher than we originally thought in Q2 was that during the quarter, if you recall, many states, if not all the states we now operate in, are mandating masks, and we decided to adopt that proactively before it happened in many states to really reinforce the importance of safety in our stores and providing the inventory for masks to make sure that during that transition, all of our customers were able to have access to a mask as a new cost, if you like, that we incurred.\n So we're being very dynamic in the way we're managing those costs to make sure that we're, first and foremost, maintaining safety, and then secondly, obviously, being as efficient as we can be. But we feel very confident in our ability to manage and balance those costs with the incremental cost savings that we're achieving in our original model.\n And as I shared in the prepared comments, we've been -- the team has done a phenomenal job in really adapting and adjusting our cost saving plans in light of COVID. And whereas in Q1, we announced that we may have some headwinds on the original $1 billion. We feel confident now we can achieve those. So overall, there'll certainly be those ongoing investments, but we feel confident in our ability to be able to manage them. Well, certainly, Karen, thanks for the question. It would have been an investment. As you are aware from what we shared in the first quarter, we saw significant benefit in expensing gross sales leverage across warehouse and transportation, across shrink and also across advertising. And while sales obviously tapered in Q2 versus Q1, we would continue to have seen selling -- expecting growth, I'm sorry, leverage on our overall sales results. So to be at 5 percent -- basis point improvement overall on gross margin, that would reflect the fact we invested in our selling growth rate during the quarter.\n In the areas that I mentioned around continued acceleration of digital pickup, particularly in the fresh categories to make sure we're delivering value for our customers. And then there would also be, I think, an element that's important to mention, mix and the fact that with deli, bakery being a lower factor in the overall sales growth would also have brought down the selling growth rate somewhat as well. Maybe I can help you with that, Karen, on the comment about pickup and delivery. As Rodney mentioned, pickup is a significantly larger portion of the overall volume. I would say both of them are growing triple digits, so we are seeing very strong growth in both, but there isn't like a major change in the mix, if you like. Both have continued to grow significantly in the COVID period. And then Robby, on your second question, I would say, probably the broader comment I would make is Rodney shared, we're still trending in double-digit sales in the early part of the current quarter. It's a pretty difficult period to read, actually. It's probably the most important point, I would say, because the Labor Day weekend changed by a week, but we're also cycling weather from last year and then having some weather in this year. So it's been a really interesting, I would say, ride for the first 4 weeks of the new quarter and trying to interpret what's going on.\n If we look at the cycling and adjusting for the weeks, I wouldn't say we really saw anything materially unusual out of Labor Day, except for some of the weather events in certain markets adding some complexity to the data. But overall, as we're coming out the other side of that, as Rodney mentioned, trending in the low double digit early part of the quarter. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. I think you summarized it well. From our perspective, we believe it's very important that we continue to deliver value for customers and we're staying very true to that plan. And when we look at prices, as we've shared a couple of examples on the call, for us, it's not just about everyday low price but it's about the promotional plan, it's about the investment in digital. And we feel like we're on a very clear path to deliver value for the customer that will drive long-term loyalty.\n The way that our customers, when we talk to them and how we look at our data and measure value, we feel very good about the position that we're in, and our customers tell us we're delivering strong value to them. And we believe really kind of linked a little bit, I think to Rodney's comment, about how we think about setting up 2021 and making sure that we're winning long-term market share and growing our business so that the -- as things cycle through the pandemic, we end in a stronger position than we would have done prior to COVID-19 is really the journey that we believe we're on to make sure that we continue to connect more deeper with customers and drive value. We feel good about the journey and the results that we're achieving. We feel it's setting us up for the ability to be able to sustain that long-term growth in the future and as [ Rodney mentioned ]. It certainly -- there's been a lot of dynamic changes in some of those fresh categories as I mentioned earlier ahead that we have to manage through. And I think the team did a phenomenal job in doing that and making sure that we help our customers navigate through that. So certainly, the -- we would just experience some of those same elements to manage during the early part of the quarter, which would have impacted at that point. But I think your initial question is the more important one of how we are thinking about balancing and investing in the business to make sure that we're delivering long-term growth. I wouldn't say that it affects how we think about how we're managing the business for the future. Just maybe add to Rodney's comments on tonnage, it ties a little bit back to Rodney's comments on market share as well that we're certainly focused on, as Rodney mentioned, our most important measure of success on sales growth is obviously growing market share. And we look at that very closely through tonnage and units as much as we do through dollars because of the -- again, making sure that we're investing in the customer, and we're certainly pleased with our tonnage market share growth as well as the dollar market share growth during the quarter.\n And then, as Rodney mentioned, Kelly, we've -- I think you've heard us say this before, but we generally build our model off of the 0.5% to 1% inflation. We'd certainly be running a bit ahead of that when you think about cost inflation, as Rodney mentioned earlier, with meat in particular being high but grocery would be probably a little bit north of 2% as well right now based on some of the trends that we're seeing."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm joined by Rodney McMullen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Millerchip, Chief Financial Officer, and they will be providing an update on the business and discussing first quarter results. \n This is obviously an unprecedented time, and we are taking the additional step of providing more details on current business trends this quarter, so our prepared remarks may run a little longer than normal. \n But before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, so Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. \n After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] \n I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah, and good morning, everyone. A lot has happened in our world since the last earnings call. We've had to adapt quickly to a new way of life. The COVID-19 pandemic and the most recent instances of racial injustice have changed our country in unmistakable ways, most profoundly the devastating loss of life and livelihood that has affected so many Americans. During the crisis, Kroger has been guided by our purpose and our values. I am proud of our associates who stepped up when we were called to be there for our customers, communities and each other. We are proud of the heroic and dedicated associates who are on the frontline, serving our customers when they need us most. As America enters the next phase of the pandemic, we know that our associates will continue to rise to the challenge, delivering Fresh for Everyone and helping our customers, communities and America emerge even stronger. \n I am proud of the measures that we've taken across our business to safeguard and support associates, customers and our communities. During the pandemic, our priority has been to provide a safe environment for our associates and customers with open stores, e-commerce solutions and an efficiently operating supply chain so that our communities have access to fresh, affordable food and essentials. \n Since March, the company has invested more than $830 million to do just that. This includes the $150 million Thank You Pay for our frontline grocery, supply chain, manufacturing, pharmacy and call center associates, which are providing -- which we are providing to acknowledge their hard work and dedication to maintaining safe, clean and stock stores. We are pleased that our associates will share in the company's success with today's second installment of Thank You Pay. We continue to invest in, support and protect our associates. We are providing emergency leave to associates. We are offering free COVID-19 testing to our associates. We have increased the contribution to our Helping Hands Fund to $15 million to provide additional financial support to associates experiencing hardship due to the virus. Our work to safeguard associates will continue as long as the pandemic threat exists, and we are proud that Kroger was named in Forbes Magazine as leading 1 of the top 10 employer responses to the pandemic. \n As part of Kroger's commitment to help America reopen safely, our Kroger Health team stepped up to help expand access to testing as a partner in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public-Private Testing Partnership. Through this initiative, we have tested more than 82,000 patients in 15 states. We also offered free check cashing for stimulus, unemployment and social security checks. Since launching this service, we've cashed more than 229,000 checks, totaling $244 million. Kroger has learned and continues to learn a lot while keeping our stores and supply chain open and serving America during the pandemic. The company's total COVID-19 incident rate is tracking meaningfully below the markets where we operate, and our overall accident rate is the lowest we've ever recorded. I'm incredibly proud of how our associates have worked together to practice creating a safer environment for our customers, communities and each other. \n We've been able to share our loans with other businesses and communities to help as they begun to safely reopen through a resource guide we created called Sharing What We've Learned: A Blueprint for Businesses. Our blueprint includes actionable recommendations and learnings that we've applied as well as what we've learned through regular interaction with governments, health departments and with business leaders in other countries, including Italy, Singapore and China, all of which were ahead of the U.S. in terms of the pandemic cycling through their countries.\n  Under Restock Kroger, we have made significant strategic choices over the last several years to transform our business model and to redefine the customer shopping experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. We've invested aggressively in technology to establish a seamless digital ecosystem, and we've made incremental investments in fresh, our brands and personalization. These investments in our competitive motes helped Kroger build business momentum in the second half of 2015, which continued through the start of our first quarter, even before the first phase of the pandemic began in our operating markets in earnest in March. \n The benefits of the changes that we've been making to our business model were accelerated by COVID-19. For example, our heavy investments in technology enabled us to reliably sustain the incredible almost overnight increase in demand for our pickup and delivery services. \n Here are other examples of how the pandemic accelerated Kroger's transformation. As you know, we introduced Kroger's brand transformation campaign, Fresh for Everyone, late in 2019. We believe that no matter who you are, where you're from, how you shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have access to fresh, affordable food. This has proven to be even more important during these times. In the initial stock-up phase of the pandemic, customers purchased a lot of paper, cleaning products and center store nonperishable items to fill their pantries. As the first new normal phase began to set in, marked by preparing for extended time at home and often with children, our fresh departments took an even greater relevance as more and more customers turn to fresh produce and proteins as staples of home-cooked meals. Fresh will continue to be an important driver of sales for Kroger as demonstrated by our fresh departments, including meat, seafood and produce, generating strong identical sales in the quarter. \n Our brands had a great quarter as well and grew 21.1% driven by significant growth across our 3 largest brands. Having identified plant-based foods as a key trend well before 2019, the Simple Truth Plant Based platform continues to deliver strong growth, growing over 32% in the first quarter. In this way, by consistently delivering both value and innovation, our brands will remain one of our most powerful competitive advantages. Because of the continued economic anxiety, we are still offering our customers value through personalization and promotions, leveraging our mailers, mobile app, website and weekly ads. We continue to offer promotions throughout the quarter with a focus on single-item purchases. \n Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As a result, we have over 2,000 pickup locations and 2,400 delivery locations, reaching 97% of our customers with a seamless customer experience that combines the best of our physical stores with digital. These investments were especially timely as customer adoption of pickup and delivery grew significantly during the pandemic. And because of our existing ecosystem, we were able to respond quickly to further expand and enhance our e-commerce services. We were able to quickly offer and promote in demand no-contact delivery and low contact pickup services. We expanded and improved contact-free payment solutions like Scan, Bag and Go and Kroger Pay. We took several steps to support the higher volume of pickup orders, including hiring additional e-commerce associates, adding more order pickup slots and increasing the frequency of communications with customers. We also began testing a grocery pickup-only location in Cincinnati. All of this contributed to a 92% sales growth in digital channels in the first quarter. In April and May, the sales grew in the top triple digits. \n We continue to invest in and constantly improve our e-commerce capabilities. Our partnership with Ocado remains an essential part of our evolving seamless ecosystem. Our customer fulfillment centers will accelerate our ability to serve customers seamlessly and in a more cost-effective way. Earlier in June, we identified 3 new regions: the Great Lakes, the Pacific Northwest and the West for placement of our high-tech sheds. When operationally, these facilities will collectively create more than 1,000 new jobs with the potential for hundreds of additional career opportunities. \n As we've shared previously, we believe Ocado's value as a partner is not just its current capabilities but also in how quickly the company is able to innovate and rapidly -- sort of rapidly changing consumer markets. We are designing a flexible distribution network, combining disaggregated demand and proximity of our stores, medium-sized facilities and large-sized facilities. You can see this strategy taking shape in the new automated CFCs which will span a range of sizes. The new facility in the West will measure 300,000 square feet. The new facility in the Pacific Northwest will measure 200,000 square feet, and the facility in the Great Lakes region will measure 150,000 square feet. The varying sizes demonstrate the flexibility of the Ocado fulfillment ecosystem to best serve the respective markets. Our network will flex as demand matures and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same day or next day, delivery or pick up and customer or store replenishment. \n Kroger has been investing to raise wages for our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, Kroger is increasing associate wages incrementally by approximately $800 million per year through the end of 2020, and this is $300 million more than the original plan. As a result of this continuing investment, Kroger has increased its average hourly rate to over $15 per hour. And with comprehensive benefits factored in, our average hourly rate is over $20 per hour, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. \n Because of these investments our -- and our established human capital management processes, we were able to expediate our hiring processes in early March to shorten the time between application and employment. Onboarding new hires an average of 72 hours and focusing onboarding on culture and safety, we were able to not only generally protect associate jobs in the face of record unemployment, we also created new jobs and new career opportunities for more than 100,000 workers nationwide. \n Our expediated hiring and onboarding processes also enabled us to focus on associate and customer safety. We were able to direct immediate support to the expansion of Kroger pickup availability as well as an enhanced cleaning and sanitation practices in our stores and facilities where we needed the help the most. Many of those new roles were bridge jobs providing laid-off workers with a stable job opportunity while furloughed from their previous jobs, many of whom are now returning -- starting to return. Additionally, I'm pleased to note an extension of our human capital commitments. We contributed an additional $236 million to multiemployer pension plans in the first quarter. This investment will help stabilize future associate benefits. \n We work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure and the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. Our focus is on developing, training, promoting internal talent while simultaneously hiring seasoned food industry executives to drive our retail supermarket business. \n Kroger remains committed to diversity, equity and inclusion with our workforce. We are creating more opportunities for our associates to openly share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with discrimination and for our company and leaders to more deeply and deliberately listen. We will continue to educate and show our leaders and associates how to be more empathetic, supportive and aware of our own unconscious biases so that, together, we can build a better and more inclusive Kroger. \n COVID-19 also accelerated our commitment to integrated ESG or sustainability practices. What we are seeing in our communities during the pandemic confirms that our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste mission is more relevant than ever. During the pandemic, more than 80 million people in the U.S. lost their jobs and applied for unemployment benefits and/or food assistance. Many more families are struggling to put food on the table today. Kroger is using our philanthropic dollars and foundations to support our food banks and other key partners. Additionally, we are now accepting SNAP/EBT benefits as payment for our pickup service, allowing more customers to access fresh, affordable food through e-commerce. \n We also implemented a dairy rescue support program for farmers. Many farmers and producers did not have a market for their products as foodservice, hospitality and restaurants remain closed. We operate 17 dairies around the country and are uniquely positioned to offer our processing capabilities. Manufacturing and dairy procurement teams rapidly scaled a program to rescue surplus milk donated by Kroger's dairy cooperative suppliers and processed by Kroger-operated dairies and directed it to food banks and families in need. \n Kroger is a trusted brand, and our #1 priority is to be there for our customers, associates and communities. We understand the transition to a new normal will not happen uniformly across the country. As America enters the next phase, we're using our own customer insights and monitoring the impact of affected global markets to help us continue meet customer needs. \n And now I'll turn it over to Gary for more detail into the quarter financials. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before discussing results for the quarter, I also want to thank our associates for their dedication and all they are doing to serve our customers and communities during this time. The pandemic brought unprecedented challenges, and I'm extremely proud of how our teams responded as America relied on Kroger as a trusted resource for their food and essential needs. As a result of the pandemic, we have seen elevated demand across our physical stores and digital channels. Our data insights show customers continue to value the convenience of our physical locations and the ease of our seamless ecosystem. \n As many of you know, we outlined our Restock Kroger transformation plan in 2017. And as part of that plan, we made the strategic decision to invest in digital. These investments allowed us to quickly add much needed capacity to serve our customers by scaling the foundational capabilities we have built and continue to develop. The outcome of these efforts has been a meaningful uplift in sales across all digital modalities: Kroger pickup, delivery and ship. \n We made significant investments of more than $830 million in the quarter to reward associates and safeguard associates, customers and communities during the pandemic. We also contribute to $236 million to multiemployer pension plans to help stabilize future associate benefits. Even with these significant investments and accelerated digital growth, we were pleased to achieve an improvement in FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We firmly believe that our ongoing investments will help Kroger emerge stronger, and it's clear from our recent customer data insights that our competitive modes, fresh, our brands, personalization and a seamless ecosystem, are even more important as a new normal begins to emerge in food retail. \n Now I'd like to discuss our quarterly results in more detail. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $1.22 per diluted share. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 19% during the first quarter. Unprecedented demand for products across grocery and fresh departments led to these strong results. Sales were broadly based across all retail divisions and remained heightened throughout the quarter as customers adjusted to the new restrictions and started preparing and eating more meals at home. Leading into the pandemic, our sales were strong, building momentum from the second half of 2019, February identical supermarket sales, without fuel, were ahead of our internal expectations. \n During the last few days of February, we started to see a shift in customer behavior as shoppers started stockpiling, and that trend accelerated into March with identical sales of approximately 30%. Sales remained elevated in April and May, both up approximately 20% as customers continue to eat more at home. In the first few weeks of the second quarter, we are starting to see some changes in demand with sales growth becoming more balanced across the store as state restrictions have started to ease. Customers remain focused on health and safety and are still stocking up but to a lesser degree than during the shutdowns. We are also starting to see a return to some splurge and impulse buying. Customers are still cooking more at home, even with the easing restrictions and identical sales, so far in the second quarter, are trending in the mid-teens. We do expect sales to continue to taper as the quarter progresses. \n Digital sales grew 92% and contributed slightly over 3% to identical sales without fuel. New customer engagement with our pickup and delivery services spiked significantly during the quarter, and we have been encouraged by early customer repeat usage. Digital sales in the second quarter remain elevated, up triple digits in the first 3 weeks. We continue to invest in digital and offered a fee-free pickup promotion to provide more value for our customers in ways that are most relevant at this time. We were also excited to announce several new enhancements to our digital customer experience, including the launch of our check-in on arrival option for pickup customers and the launch of contactless doorstep delivery. \n Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the first quarter was $1.45 billion compared to $957 million in the first quarter of 2019. Gross margin was 24.3% of sales for the first quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 44 basis points due to sales leverage related to shrink, transportation, warehousing and advertising costs. Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which saw significant improvement in the first quarter compared to last year. The OG&A rate increased 51 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. No adjustment was made to this number for COVID-19-related costs. \n As previously mentioned, during the quarter, Kroger made the decision to contribute an incremental $236 million to multiemployer pension plans. Excluding the incremental pension contribution, fuel and adjustment items, the OG&A rate improved 10 basis points. Rent and depreciation, excluding fuel, decreased 37 basis points due to sales leverage. We do expect some COVID-related costs to continue beyond the first quarter as we continue to invest in associate and customer safety as well as support heightened digital demand. \n We also made the decision to delay certain Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives to allow our associates to focus on our most important priorities: safety and stocking shelves. We have now started to reintroduce the delayed initiatives while also maintaining our commitment to associate and customer safety. We still expect to achieve the vast majority of the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020. \n Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. We saw a significant decline in gallons during the quarter as with the national trend. We remain well positioned within our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and market-leading reward program. The average retail price of fuel was $2.13 this quarter versus $2.62 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the first quarter was $0.48 compared to $0.23 in the same quarter last year. And as a result, fuel profitability was a major tailwind in the quarter. For the remainder of 2020, we expect fuel profitability to be a headwind compared to prior year as we cycle margins from 2019, and gallons continue to be impacted by COVID-19. \n Kroger's alternative profit model is built from a platform of leveraging supermarket traffic and data and is expected to achieve profit growth in 2020. \n During the first quarter, Kroger Personal Finance experienced lower transactions as customers purchase less gift cards, money services and lottery. Customer activity has started to improve since April as states have reopened. And while we would expect this trend to continue, KPF profit is expected to be lower than our original expectations for 2020. \n Media experienced a slowdown in late March and April as campaigns were paused to refocus messaging on store and employee safety and certain in-store programs were impacted by stay-at-home orders. Our Media business rebounded strongly in May, and the strength of our digital sales growth has created significant momentum for Kroger Precision Marketing, which is now on track to achieve 50% growth in 2020. We remain confident in the significant potential of alternative profits, especially given the continued growth in traffic across our store and digital ecosystem. Despite short-term headwinds due to COVID-19, we continue to expect alternative profit to be a major accelerator of our model in the future. \n As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Food 4 Less California and South Carolina during the first quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Roanoke, Little Rock and Houston, as well as Dallas meat clocks.\n Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations later in the year, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Charleston, West Virginia and Fry's associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. \n Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way which will help create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. \n Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain strong liquidity. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend over time. We are being disciplined in how we deploy capital, and all aspects of our capital plan are being evaluated to make sure that our investments position Kroger for long-term success post COVID-19. We still expect total capital expenditure of between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion in 2020. \n Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio is 1.81 compared to 2.54 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Kroger held temporary cash investments of approximately $2.3 billion as of the end of the quarter, reflecting improvements in operating performance and significant improvements in working capital. We expect working capital to improve for the year, although not to the level experienced in the first quarter, which was inflated by the extraordinary sales growth due to COVID-19. \n Given the uncertainties that remain related to COVID-19 and the outlook for the remainder of 2020, we believe it's prudent to maintain financial flexibility in the short term. We remain committed to our dividend and share repurchase program. And in the coming months, we will also be evaluating the optimal use of any excess free cash flow, consistent with our previously stated capital allocation strategy. \n Turning now to guidance for 2020. The COVID pandemic has dramatically changed the outlook for food retail, and we continue to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. There are still many unknown factors related to the long-term impact of COVID-19 that could influence our financial results for the remainder of 2020, such as continued investments to help our customers and associates; uncertainty surrounding consumer behavior, restrictions and what will be the new normal; and potential long-term shift in customers eating more food at home. \n In recognition of these factors, it's difficult to predict specific outcomes. And as such, Kroger is not reaffirming or providing new 2020 guidance. While we do expect to exceed the outlook shared in our April 1 business update for identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit, adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow, the company is not able to forecast the extent of such upside for the reasons mentioned. As we continue to proactively adjust our plans in response to the pandemic, we remain committed to investing to ensure a safe environment for our associates and customers, and we will also continue to use our customer insights to invest in delivering greater value for customers in ways they value most and that build loyalty. \n Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We remain confident in our business model as well as our ability to generate strong free cash flow and achieve sustainable and attractive total shareholder returns. \n In the second quarter, we expect identical sales, excluding fuel, to continue at elevated levels, although tapering from the trends we've experienced so far in the quarter. We expect EPS growth in the second quarter to be in the mid- to high single-digit range with tailwinds in the supermarket sales, partially offset by continued investments and fuel headwinds. As the longer-term impact of COVID-19 becomes clearer, we are committed to providing more clarity on our expectations for the remainder of the year. \n I'll now turn it back to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. I am so proud and deeply grateful for our 0.5 million associates who step forward to be there for our customers and communities when they need us the most. In true Kroger spirit, they have risen to the occasion to each challenge presented with a strong spirit of agility, determination and service to meet the needs of our customers, and these are the exact skills that will ensure the company will remain relevant to our customers in the future. \n As I shared when we first began this call, we quickly had to adapt to a new way of life. We continue to make progress on the underlying business, even with the recent customer demand tailwinds. We are confident that Restock Kroger has allowed us to reposition our business and to create value for all our stakeholders prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n Now we look forward to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: Gary, I just want to go back to your -- I guess your -- what you just said about Q2 EPS growth, mid- to high single digit. I think you said mid- to high single-digit EPS growth. Can you just help us understand more some of the headwinds there getting to that level of growth? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think the biggest factor, Rupesh, would be that -- I mentioned it earlier, but just to maybe to give a bit more color on fuel for quarter 1 and how we see quarter 2 potentially shaping up because that would be the -- I think the biggest factor in the numbers. Overall, as I mentioned earlier, when we think about the supermarket business, we're expecting continued strong sales momentum, and we feel good about the ability to manage the margin and the investments that we'll continue to make as a result of COVID-19. \n I think the biggest factor and the difference between the 2 quarters as we look at the guidance for the second quarter, in the first quarter, fuel has been a significant tailwind for us overall despite the fact that gallons were significantly lower through COVID. As we start to look at Q2, and we'll be cycling margins from Q2 last year, and even though the fuel trend in gallons has continued to gradually get better every week, we're still seeing a decline in year-over-year gallons. And the current trend would be in the sort of mid-teens range of negative growth in gallons, which is consistent with what's being seen in the market. \n So as we look at the fuel performance in Q2 and what we see today, we're thinking that could be a headwind of anywhere between $50 million to $100 million. So it would be important to think about that as you're thinking about the guidance that we shared for Q2 because that would be the -- I think the primary factor that would despite the continued growth and improvement in performance that we'd expect over the original budget in the supermarket business. Hope that helped. \nRupesh Parikh: That's great. And then -- okay. That's really helpful. And then just one follow-up question. So just on e-commerce. So as you guys look at -- obviously, you have the partnership with Ocado. How does what you've seen recently change your, I guess, your e-commerce plans or investments going forward? \nW. McMullen: I love the question. And if you look at the strategic decisions we've made over the last several years, it highlighted those decisions really paid off in the current environment. Our digital and delivery and pickup business in the last 2 months grew triple digits and continues to grow at that. And to have the ability to grow at that kind of level that quickly, just so proud of the whole team in terms of the foundations that were already in place but also the stores and all the other parts and supply chain on being able to supply and hire people and support that. So we fundamentally believe the long-term trend will continue where people will continually depend more on e-commerce. We certainly have seen that be accelerated. We don't think it will stay at the higher level where it is today permanently, but we do think, fundamentally, the growth has been accelerated and will be higher than where it started before COVID-19 and then grow from there. \n One of the things that's incredibly important is all the pieces tied together, including Ocado, will allow us to continue to grow and improve our profitability of that part of the business. As you know, when a customer first switches to online, it typically takes 3 or 4 years before that customer's profitability is the same as when they shop in the store. But what we find is we get a significantly higher share of that customer's total household spend. And there isn't anything that we've seen that wouldn't cause us to believe that the new e-commerce shopper doesn't feel that way, and a lot of those customers are telling us they intend to continue to shop more e-commerce than before, and we would expect to get a higher share of their business. \n We've also seen a lot of customers new to Kroger come and use our delivery and pickup business, and we're seeing nice repeat purchases from those customers. So all those things cause us to feel good about the things we have in place and feel even better about Ocado and the other pieces that we're working on going forward. \nOperator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I was going to ask something different, but I wanted to ask you, Rodney. You just made the comment, it takes about 3 to 4 years to achieve the same profits. Do you mean that on an ongoing basis? Or is that lifetime value because over 3 to 4 years, I've purchased enough through the digital channel. And therefore the -- I guess the profit becomes equal? Or on a go-forward basis after year 3 or 4, the variable cost or the actual basket economics of each become even? \nW. McMullen: It's each customer's household. So if you look, obviously, when they first switched to e-commerce, we're spending the labor to pick their order, where before that, the customer spent that labor. What we find is, over time, we continue to get more efficient with our picking operations on picking an order, and the customer spends more money with us, so their total spend increases. So what we find is every -- you'd have to look at every single customer separately. So the customers that first started shopping e-commerce 3 years ago, they're to the point now where their profitability is the same as before they went to e-commerce, but we're getting a higher percentage of their spend. And looking forward, we believe we'll be able to continue to reduce the cost to serve that customer. A new customer starts day 1, so you have that headwind until we are able to earn more of their total household spend. And what we find is we're able to do that. \nSimeon Gutman: Yes. That's helpful. And my follow-up is on the 92% growth in the first quarter. Did you say the mix? Or are you surprised by anything about the mix between delivery and pickup? And then anything you can share on how it impacted gross margins or margins broadly? It sounds like if you picked up a lot of new customers, it would be in a pretty dilutive position for that lifetime of the customer, but anything you can share on it, please. \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look, delivery was a higher growth than pickup, especially during the peak of the COVID cases. As areas have reopened and companies have reopened their offices and things like that, the growths are starting to get more similar. \n Gary, on the growth, I'll let you answer the growth and the changes there. \nGary Millerchip: Sure, yes. Thanks for the question. I would say that the way that we see the digital customer behavior flow through in the P&L, it's not a meaningfully different mix in terms of overall pass-through in gross margin rates. Rodney's point earlier, generally, we see customers increase their spend. The basket size increases, and the mix is pretty consistent. The area that would have impacted gross margin would have been more in the fact that we run the fee waiver promotion. So that would have certainly been a headwind in the gross margin category. \n Really, where we see the bigger impact on digital is Rodney's earlier response around the incremental labor that's involved in picking the order. So if you think about the pass-through rate that we might see on a traditional sale through the store, which we've talked about historically being the 15% plus range, it would be significantly lower than that on the equivalent basis because you've got the incremental labor associated with those sales. So it would be more of an impact in the OG&A rate than it would be in gross margin when you think about the quarter. \nOperator: The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Yes. Just, first, a follow-up and then a real question. As we think about Q2, could you just help us out? What are you assuming for IDs in the quarter? What are you thinking about from a continued COVID cost perspective? And how do we think about gross margin relative to what we just saw in Q1? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. There's a couple of parts for that, obviously. I think in terms of sales, as we shared in our brief prepared comments on sales, we're obviously watching the trends very closely. Part of the challenge is it's very hard to know obviously exactly how we expect the customer behavior to return back to whatever a new normal becomes. We certainly expect as states have reopened to start to see a gradual return to some level of lower food eaten at home, but we do think that's going to be more gradual than a specific stair step-down. We're starting to see some change in Q2, as we mentioned during the prepared comments, and -- but it's not really sort of a specific step-down when states have reopened. It's much more of a gradual process as you start to see customers returning to some level of normal behavior. \n I would also say it's not very consistent. It's not as though states that reopened first are seeing the bigger step-down. It's relatively more tied to when states first experienced a major outbreak of COVID from what we can see and also depending on how aggressive the spike in sales were in that market when the outbreak first happened. That's tending to more correlate with the gradual change in shopping behavior. \n So we're watching it very closely. We are starting to see visit frequency pick up a bit. We're seeing more of the departments that might be more splurge I mentioned earlier growing like daily baker and specialty cheese and floral, but it really is a gradual process. And I think we still say it's too early at the moment, only a few weeks in to know. So we're expecting it to be a gradual step-down from where we ended Q1 and the trend that we shared so far in Q2. And obviously, we're watching it very closely and maintaining flexibility to make sure we're winning every dollar from a customer perspective around how we make sure we're continuing to grow market share and grow share of wallet. \n From a gross margin perspective, obviously, we haven't gone into a specific guidance around what we would expect to see there. We continue to invest in promotions, as Rodney shared, and we certainly expect that to become more and more normal as we go through the year now that the supply chain is starting to normalize, but there are still going to be some areas where it will be more difficult to promote where there are still some overhangs of supply issues in certain categories. \n On the COVID-related costs, it really -- if you think about breaking down the total OG&A expense in Q1, it's really 3 buckets I would kind of categorize it into. The first would be the COVID-specific costs around the $830 million that we talked about, obviously, in the press release and the prepared comments. The majority of that was around rewarding our associates and making sure that they shared in the success of the quarter. And then there were also some costs associated with incremental labor for cleaning and PPE equipment. We'd certainly be expecting some of those costs to continue as we go through the year with safety being the top priority. We're also obviously investing in labor in supporting our digital growth, and we'd expect that labor to continue as we continue to win that customer and make sure that we're winning their overall loyalty. And the third major cost in OG&A, obviously, with the pension contribution, which we wouldn't be expecting to repeat. \n So I think it's really in OG&A. The cost that will flow through are going to be the safety and cleaning costs that we'd expect to continue to be investing in and the incremental labor associated with supporting digital growth going forward. \nW. McMullen: One other comment, Ed, on the first part of your question, and it's hard to assign specific numbers and specific numbers just for the second quarter versus third quarter, fourth quarter and even 2021. But when we talk to customers, we -- our customers still tell us they plan to eat more meals at home than before. When talking to customers about when their children return to schools, we still have a significantly higher percentage of families telling us they plan to make breakfast for the kids to take to school and lunch for the kids to take to school. All of those things in terms of what customers are telling us, we would expect there'll be more meals eaten at home or prepared at home that obviously will help support growth as well. \nEdward Kelly: I understand the reluctance to really give ID guidance. But the only thing that I would say is that it does matter if it's mid- to high single-digit EPS growth on a double-digit ID versus a single-digit ID from an investment perspective. So to the extent that you can help out with that, that I think would matter to how people are looking at your story. \n The other thing that I needed to ask about is the pension contribution because I think people are getting kind of hung up here. The $200-plus million contribution that you made this quarter, I believe that relates to that group of 4 meat plants that you essentially kind of control and take in-house. Is that right? \nGary Millerchip: That's right. So think of it as it's a green status plan. It's over 80% funded, so there's not an obligation for us to make that payment. But obviously, it's something that we're committed to making sure that, long term, we're securing that future liquidity of the plant. And especially during times like this when there's market volatility, sometimes there could be pressure on those plans to have to liquidate assets to be able to make contributions, and we wanted to make sure that the plans were not put in that risk. So we decided to basically invest those dollars now to protect the future. And obviously, over time, that will derisk the need for us to have to invest, but it wasn't a requirement to make those payments. \nEdward Kelly: Okay. So it sounds like that's pretty funded at this point, so maybe we don't see that type of contribution going forward. The other plans that you have is you have a -- you're obviously in the traditional map, right, with other grocers, which is negotiated, and there's no real reason for you to make one-off contributions like this into those plans. Isn't that right? \nGary Millerchip: That's correct. Yes. The only way that we would approach those examples would be if we identified an opportunity to be able to pull away from the multiemployer plans and bring them into the same way that we run that UFCW plan if there was a -- if it made sense for us to do that from an investor and associate perspective because we could derisk the future liabilities and be able to take more control of that potential exposure in the future But we have no obligation on those, unless we were to make -- take that action like we did with the plan you described earlier. \nEdward Kelly: Right. And your defined benefit plan, the corporate one, is frozen now, right? \nGary Millerchip: That's right. Exactly, yes. That's fully funded. \nOperator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: Just following up on that. So the actual -- can you give us an update on what the actual liability is on the multi-employer pension in dollars pretax? And then with this contribution that you just made, is there -- do we adjust -- and I know you haven't given the annual P&L and cash impact of the multiemployer pension contribution for many years. But -- are we think -- like when we think about modeling it, beginning 2Q, does that actual expense dollar amount come down based on the contribution you just made? And then I had a totally separate question. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. So it depends on which piece of the plan, just to clarify, Karen, you're talking about. So as Ed mentioned a moment ago, we have a multiemployer plans that we separated and we now manage internally. And as I mentioned earlier, they would be in the green status, so there'd be no obligation for us to be making those payments, but we're obviously looking to get them over time a fully funded status and to minimize the risk to associates. So think about that as it's minimizing. If returns weren't where they needed to be, it minimizes the risk as of us having to make contributions in the future and ensures those pension plans are in a strong position for our associates. \n The multiemployer plans that we're a participant in but we don't have a current obligation to fund beyond the annual contributions that we're making through our negotiated contracts with the unions, that would be an exposure as of the end of last year and as we reported in the 10-K, $2.3 billion or $1.8 million after tax. And they're ones where, over time, we would certainly look at if there are options to figure out different ways to structure our arrangements so that we can address those liabilities, but they would be very specifically defined and ring-fenced transactions that we would obviously share publicly in the future, if we were to decide that was the right thing to do. \nKaren Short: But as we think about the actual expense on the P&L beginning in 2Q, I know, again, you don't guide to that anymore, but how should we think about that? \nGary Millerchip: Expense related to what, I'm sorry, Karen, I'm not sure I'm following. \nKaren Short: Well, the multiemployer expense. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. So we -- as I mentioned, we would have pension expense related to our multiemployer plans that we pay into as part of the negotiated contracts with the unions. And obviously, where we need to continue to fund the plan that's internal, we'll make those contributions when we need to. But we -- obviously, that can vary significantly. But most of the most of the pull -- if I call it, pull forward may be a potential liability in the future, it doesn't relate to what we would do in 2020. \nKaren Short: Okay. Got it. And then just looking at digital, in terms of your overall digital, would you just be able to give us what your actual percent of sales in digital was in 1Q? And then what the split was between -- I guess, click-and-collect and third party, which I would say is mostly Instacart? \n And then the last question I had was just on your cash balance of the $2 billion, just thoughts on that. \nW. McMullen: Well, if you look in terms of overall, digital would have been, I don't know, probably 6.5% or 7% of the total company. It would have been predominantly pickup versus delivery in terms of the mix, but the percentage growth was higher on delivery. So -- and if you look at -- the other thing on delivery, a lot is delivered directly to people's homes, either through FedEx or UPS. And that's basically the similar number is what is delivered via Instacart and other services. \n On the other piece, Gary, I'll let you answer Karen's other. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Sorry, we were all looking to get the digital number for you there, Karen. Can you repeat the second part of the question? \nKaren Short: Oh, just on the cash balance. I mean you guys haven't had a cash balance like that for a while. So thoughts on where you're at in terms of deployment of that? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. So as I mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, we -- certainly, we're thrilled with the cash balance that we generated during the quarter. Part of that does reflect the improved operating performance. Part of it was a significant improvement in working capital. We want to make sure that, obviously, we maintain maximum flexibility in the short term, just with some of the uncertainty that still exists in the market. And we also want to make sure we understand how much of the working capital benefit will continue because we do believe we've made strong progress on working capital over the last really 12 months to 18 months as we've continued to look at ways to free up cash flow, but some elements of that will be inflated, just because of the higher sales in the first quarter and the way our working capital cycle works. And some of it is also related to the CARES Act, where there's a delay in certain tax payments as part of the way that the CARES Act was structured. So we would expect as a result of all of that still to generate incremental free cash flow this year. \n As we go through the next couple of months, we're really going to focus on what do we think is the optimal way to use that cash flow consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy that we shared with you in our Investor Day in November. So think about is we'll look at are there opportunities where we could continue to invest in the business to drive longer-term growth. We'll certainly be looking at are there any reasons to restructure any of the pension future MEPP liabilities that would allow us to take that potential liability and risk off the table longer term. And then, of course, we'll also be looking at how might we redeploy that cash to our shareholders consistent with our strategy of continuing to grow our dividend over time but also looking at buybacks to shareholders as well. \nOperator: The next question is from Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nJudah Frommer: One, a little bit more long term. You guys probably have some of the best data analytics on your customer base in the industry. So when Rodney mentioned kind of the habits of newer customers and specifically new e-com customers, right, how could you see the opportunity to further monetize or kind of gain further loyalty from new and existing customers kind of beyond the pandemic, right? If you assume that people are going to eat a little bit more at home and that you have the ability to kind of incentivize your customers to do a little bit more than that, how does maybe next year look for you relative to where you may have thought it would be before the pandemic? \nW. McMullen: Yes. We love the question, and it's something that we're spending a ton of resources. We had as many new customers come to us in a couple of weeks as what we did all of last year, and we continue to have a lot of new customers. So we're using all the things that we would normally do on welcoming new customers in but doing it in a much more aggressive way. Obviously, one of the things that we want to make sure is they have a great experience. So if you look at our supply chain team working with our merchants, we're getting the stores inventories back up to pre-COVID levels. So the in-stock position improves. The continued focus on fresh and continuing to even -- fresh was a priority already, but making sure that the products that customers get stays fresh and then with a friendly smile or an incredibly easy digital experience. \n So your question, we love, it's the opportunity that we have in front of us. So far, we've been able to gain good market share during the pandemic. And obviously, we're going to continue to focus on making sure we take care of those customers and keep them and continue to build their basket in terms of what they spend with us versus other places. \nGary Millerchip: Judah, the only thing I would add is that, to your point around data, we spent a lot of time looking at the data that we have and also the data that's available in the marketplace over the last 20 years from whether it's government data, more broad market data, along with our own shopping information, and really looking at what are the scenarios around where we see the customer going over, to your point, not really the next sort of month or 2 but the rest of the year and into next year and maybe even further out. \n We do feel from everything that we see that we're putting ourselves in a strong position based on the investments that we're making as part of Restock Kroger to come out the other side of this in a stronger place. And everything that we see, while this obviously no one knows and it's hard to predict, would say that based on the -- less around maybe the pandemic but just on generally when customers are in more of an economically challenged situation and combining that with these restrictions, we do think there'll be some level of a -- I won't call it a permanent shift but a multiple-year shift to food eaten at home versus food away from home, and that's been very much the case in our data and the external data when you look at the last couple of recessions. \n So our focus is very much on how do we make sure we're using personalization and tools and our strategy around creating value to really make sure that as we look out 12, 18 months, we come out of this in a stronger position, both in customers consuming more food at home but also Kroger's market share, so that it allows us to accelerate our overall long-term model around Restock Kroger but also delivering shareholder value. And we feel very positive about the way in which we believe we can deliver that over longer term. I think it's easier to look at the longer term in some ways than it is probably for the next 6 months and how exactly the trends will play out. \nJudah Frommer: Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just follow up on kind of 2 items that maybe we could clean up a little bit. Just first on the pension. In terms of go-forward expense that's hitting the income statement, that hasn't changed at all. Just what's running through the income statement is what you're required to contribute to those external net plans? Is that right? \n And then second, for the gross margin in Q2, is there still a headwind from alternative profits being a little bit slower than they would be? And is there also some benefit from promotions not being fully back to where you'd expect them to be? \nGary Millerchip: Sure. On the pension side, yes, so the payment that we're making in Q2 is a discrete payment that we -- sorry, in Q1, I'm sorry, that we deliberately took the decision as we were in a strong position from a performance perspective and a cash flow perspective. We have no obligation to make that payment. It doesn't cause us to have to make payments later in the year or that we are obligated to some additional commitments later in the year. It was very much a decision that we made to take advantage of the strong performance and essentially protect that future risk and make sure that our associates' pension plans are in a strong position. So it's very much more of a forward-looking view of saying let's make sure we're putting ourselves and putting our associates in a position where we're protecting the future when we have the opportunity to do so. \n From a gross margin perspective, yes, certainly, I think on the alternative profit side, I mentioned it earlier. On the Media business, we're seeing a tremendous pickup in growth. So I wouldn't believe that we would see any headwinds from media. That's continuing to bounce back very strongly from a very temporary delay that we experienced in the first quarter, really during the lockdown period and as things were reset. Kroger Personal Finance is the biggest element of alternative profit from a profit contribution perspective, and that is sort of more, I guess, dependent on some of the broader recovery in the market when you think about gift card sales, restaurants are an important part of that category. \n And when you think about credit card spend, those elements are all tied to continued improvement in the economic situation. So while we are still able to tap into opportunity in KPF because we have low penetration of our customer base, we would expect that to continue to be a headwind in terms of impacting gross margin and performance for the year. But media, certainly, we wouldn't have that same view there. \nW. McMullen: And we would expect to continue to do promotions. And one of the things when you look at the details behind first quarter, almost basically all the gross margin improvement was driven by leverages and marketing expense from the higher sales, warehouse and transportation and shrink, and our team had incredible strong quarter on shrink. So it's really those leverage, and we would expect continue to have some of those leverage benefits at the higher sales that we're expecting. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Recognizing that it takes several years for a digital customer to become as profitable as an in-store customer, what will be the margin impact over the next 3 years if your digital penetration remains where it is today? \nW. McMullen: It's a great question. And I can tell you before COVID-19, our digital business has become a tailwind in terms of the incremental improvement from where it was before. And as we look forward, we would expect as customers mature that, that would still be the case. And that's going to be a combination of customer spending -- and I'm talking about in total, not just the new customers by themselves. In total, as that customer continues to give us more of their total share of spend for a household and as our teams continue to take costs out in terms of serving that customer and as our Ocado sheds begin to take -- come online and some of the other facilities to supply our customers, we would expect that digital will be a tailwind for us as we move forward, and it's really just the fact that the business basically doubled overnight. \nMichael Lasser: And you mentioned that you're building all different types of Ocado shed. The first one are large ones in different parts of the country. What has the learnings from this experience influence -- how it influenced the sheds that you're going to create moving forward? \nW. McMullen: It's really if you look -- as we've been working on it in total, and Ocado has done a lot of work to be able to get the economics viable for a smaller shed, over time, that will allow us to go into smaller markets with those -- with sheds as well. So it's part of the overall supply chain design, and it's playing out as we expected. And Ocado is continuing to up their game as well. So it's really the experience. We're looking forward to Ocado's sheds opening up in Canada and France, and that will provide an additional set of learnings as well. \nMichael Lasser: And if I could add one last one. I know this is hard to tease out from the data, but you have a lot of really good information. What have you been able to discern about different meal occasions that are now being eaten at home? So as consumers return to work and eat more of their meals at restaurants around where they work, to what degree is that going to result in the slowdown in the IDs that you're experiencing? Similarly, maybe you can tease out how soups and salads are doing versus something you might eat at dinner, where dinner could also slow as we go to those families more. \nW. McMullen: Yes. The -- overall, we're still seeing people shop at fewer stores and, as Gary mentioned, a large spend per basket. If you look at the department, that's probably the easiest directly to talk about is our deli department. And our deli department, the trends over the last 4 or 5 weeks have been significantly improved from where it was in the height of the lockdowns. We would expect a lot of those meals are things where people are preparing at home and taking to work. Our customers tell us they're still minimizing the different places they go and minimizing their exposure. So that's something that we want to make sure that we're there for the customer. \nOperator: The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. \nSpencer Hanus: This is Spencer on for Greg. I understand that the situation still remains pretty fluid. But can you just provide some additional color on what you think the new normal looks like for food retail? And do you think COVID has accelerated a structural shift towards sort of eating at home channel? \nW. McMullen: Yes. The -- first of all, if you look at things that we think, for sure, is the digital channel and people eating via that accelerated the trends that we're already on. If you look at like our Home Chef business, they had an incredible quarter with picking up new customers as well. \n The thing that I get most hopeful about is when we talk to customers, customers tell us they like eating at home as a family and eating together and having meals together at home. And one of our responsibilities is to help them keep it fresh and innovative and new ideas, and we continue to work on that. But everything that we can see, the customer likes that, and they like learning how to cook and cook as a family. So that trend is something that we focus on a lot and try to make sure we're supportive of it. \nSpencer Hanus: That's helpful. And then we've seen promotions tick down across the industry throughout this crisis. Has COVID changed your philosophy on price investments at all? And then would you expect an acceleration in promotions in the back half of the year? \nW. McMullen: Yes. One of the things that I'm super proud of our teams is we've had an ad and promoted every week during the pandemic to try to help our customers' budget go as far as possible. The only change that we made was we stopped doing the buy 10 for 10s and things like that, that incentivized multiple purchases on items that we're in short supply because we wanted to support as many customers as possible, getting those. \n We would continue to use our data to understand what's important to the customer and some customers are in different financial situations, whether they lost their jobs or they were able to work from home. And we're supporting both of those customer segments with promotions, loyalty mailings and other offers that are 1:1, in addition to what you can see in an ad, and we think that's an important component to continue to support. \nGary Millerchip: I think the other thing I would add, Rodney, is that we mentioned earlier around the pickup fee being an investment in price with the promotion there. But also, we did adapt our plan around making sure we're giving value to customers where product was more available. And so the team did a really nice job in promoting on HBC and general merchandise products. And while it's very true to say that grocery and fresh led the way, we saw significant double-digit growth in both of those categories and would have seen some lower gross margin in those 2 categories because we were more promotional in making sure that as being a business that was opened through the pandemic that we were delivering value for customers. I think that's been -- the team did a really nice job of making sure we were creating value there and delivering value there. \nOperator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Goldman: I'll just ask 1 because I know we're late. You talked about some of the trends in states that reopened first. Maybe too early, but what are you seeing in states where there are headlines about a second wave or cases increasing? Have you seen any upticks there? Or again, is it just too early to say for sure? \nW. McMullen: I think it's too early to tell for sure, and those were states where people were more comfortable going out, anyway, even during lockdowns. So it's really early to -- but we're really not seeing massive shift changes. \n One last question. \nOperator: And that question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. \nMichael Montani: Just want to see if -- can you hear me? \nW. McMullen: Yes. \nMichael Montani: Okay. Great. Sorry about that. So the question I have was 2 parts. The first was on traffic and ticket. I know you don't typically disclose that, but if you could give some incremental color around the 19% ID sales on that line? And then secondly, related to that was just if there's a sense of what percentage of that comp is being generated by existing loyal households versus the new households. Obviously, you had mentioned, Rodney, there was some strong growth in new customer acquisition. \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at -- on the ticket growth, we had significant double-digit increases in the average basket size. And we're finding that customers are going into the store less frequently, and so well over 100% of the growth is driven by basket size. If you look at new customers and existing customers, it's a meaningful number, but it's maybe 1/4 or 1/3 of the total when you look at all the pieces because we also have a lot of new customers to pick up and where we've launched where customers can pay a SNAP at pickup and things like that, new customers there as well. \nMichael Montani: Okay. And then I guess the other one I had was a lot of the questions I've been getting relate to how you all would be positioned to cycle this kind of comp in a year from now. And so I was just wondering if you could provide some incremental color around the Ocado partnership and I guess, in particular, as it relates to some of the c-store fulfillments and also like center store potential efficiencies that you could gain and reinvest back into competitive positioning. \nW. McMullen: Yes. The -- that's a question, obviously, we're spending a lot of time internally talking through and trying to understand as well. The thing that, Gary talked about it a little bit, but if you look at -- we would expect '21 to be better than what the trend would have been for '21 before COVID, and Gary mentioned that briefly in answering one of the other questions. So everything that we can see, we believe there are certainly meaningful shifts in the way people eat. I won't say permanent but certainly multiyear and that we would expect '21 to be better than what '21 would have been before COVID. \n To give more specifics than that, I think it's hard to say. As we get to next year, one of the things that we would expect is, certainly, in-stock positions will be better, which will be helpful, but people will be going back to a normal life more so as well. So we're going to do everything we can to make sure we're taking care of the customers we have and getting more of their share in the new customers. And the easiest point of context is just we would expect '21 to be better than what '21 would have been pre-COVID. \n Thanks, Michael. Appreciate it. I think the last question was a great question to end on. If you look at Restock Kroger and the work from Restock Kroger certainly position the Kroger well to deal, and we had good growth before COVID, and COVID certainly accelerated the infrastructure and foundations we had in place. And as we look to 2021, we would expect that to be better than what it was before COVID. \n The other comment that I want to make is, as you know, we always like to share a few final comments directed toward our associates and how we live our purpose every day. The senseless killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and so many more, too many more across our country have shaken me to the core. We share in everyone's feelings of sadness and outrage for the victims and their families. I am compelled to use Kroger's voice to express that we're against racism and the injustice toward the Black community. To become a greater part of the solution, we believe the most important next step is to listen. \n Recently, I was proud to be invited by Dr. Bernice King of The King Center to listen, learn and participate in open dialogue about how companies like ours can drive real tangible change. We also held the first of several listening sessions to hear directly from our associates about how we can better support them. Informed by deliberate listening, we intend to take more action. As the first step, our company is establishing a $5 million fund to support the advancement of racial equality and justice. This new investment will be earmarked within The Kroger Foundation for improving diversity, equity and inclusion. We know there's more work to be done, and we will continue to share our progress. \n Thank you for all you have done and will do for each other and our customers and communities. And to all on the call, thank you for joining our call today. Thank you very much. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rebekah, and good morning, everyone. A lot has happened in our world since the last earnings call. We've had to adapt quickly to a new way of life. The COVID-19 pandemic and the most recent instances of racial injustice have changed our country in unmistakable ways, most profoundly the devastating loss of life and livelihood that has affected so many Americans. During the crisis, Kroger has been guided by our purpose and our values. I am proud of our associates who stepped up when we were called to be there for our customers, communities and each other. We are proud of the heroic and dedicated associates who are on the frontline, serving our customers when they need us most. As America enters the next phase of the pandemic, we know that our associates will continue to rise to the challenge, delivering Fresh for Everyone and helping our customers, communities and America emerge even stronger. \n I am proud of the measures that we've taken across our business to safeguard and support associates, customers and our communities. During the pandemic, our priority has been to provide a safe environment for our associates and customers with open stores, e-commerce solutions and an efficiently operating supply chain so that our communities have access to fresh, affordable food and essentials. \n Since March, the company has invested more than $830 million to do just that. This includes the $150 million Thank You Pay for our frontline grocery, supply chain, manufacturing, pharmacy and call center associates, which are providing -- which we are providing to acknowledge their hard work and dedication to maintaining safe, clean and stock stores. We are pleased that our associates will share in the company's success with today's second installment of Thank You Pay. We continue to invest in, support and protect our associates. We are providing emergency leave to associates. We are offering free COVID-19 testing to our associates. We have increased the contribution to our Helping Hands Fund to $15 million to provide additional financial support to associates experiencing hardship due to the virus. Our work to safeguard associates will continue as long as the pandemic threat exists, and we are proud that Kroger was named in Forbes Magazine as leading 1 of the top 10 employer responses to the pandemic. \n As part of Kroger's commitment to help America reopen safely, our Kroger Health team stepped up to help expand access to testing as a partner in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public-Private Testing Partnership. Through this initiative, we have tested more than 82,000 patients in 15 states. We also offered free check cashing for stimulus, unemployment and social security checks. Since launching this service, we've cashed more than 229,000 checks, totaling $244 million. Kroger has learned and continues to learn a lot while keeping our stores and supply chain open and serving America during the pandemic. The company's total COVID-19 incident rate is tracking meaningfully below the markets where we operate, and our overall accident rate is the lowest we've ever recorded. I'm incredibly proud of how our associates have worked together to practice creating a safer environment for our customers, communities and each other. \n We've been able to share our loans with other businesses and communities to help as they begun to safely reopen through a resource guide we created called Sharing What We've Learned: A Blueprint for Businesses. Our blueprint includes actionable recommendations and learnings that we've applied as well as what we've learned through regular interaction with governments, health departments and with business leaders in other countries, including Italy, Singapore and China, all of which were ahead of the U.S. in terms of the pandemic cycling through their countries.\n  Under Restock Kroger, we have made significant strategic choices over the last several years to transform our business model and to redefine the customer shopping experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. We've invested aggressively in technology to establish a seamless digital ecosystem, and we've made incremental investments in fresh, our brands and personalization. These investments in our competitive motes helped Kroger build business momentum in the second half of 2015, which continued through the start of our first quarter, even before the first phase of the pandemic began in our operating markets in earnest in March. \n The benefits of the changes that we've been making to our business model were accelerated by COVID-19. For example, our heavy investments in technology enabled us to reliably sustain the incredible almost overnight increase in demand for our pickup and delivery services. \n Here are other examples of how the pandemic accelerated Kroger's transformation. As you know, we introduced Kroger's brand transformation campaign, Fresh for Everyone, late in 2019. We believe that no matter who you are, where you're from, how you shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have access to fresh, affordable food. This has proven to be even more important during these times. In the initial stock-up phase of the pandemic, customers purchased a lot of paper, cleaning products and center store nonperishable items to fill their pantries. As the first new normal phase began to set in, marked by preparing for extended time at home and often with children, our fresh departments took an even greater relevance as more and more customers turn to fresh produce and proteins as staples of home-cooked meals. Fresh will continue to be an important driver of sales for Kroger as demonstrated by our fresh departments, including meat, seafood and produce, generating strong identical sales in the quarter. \n Our brands had a great quarter as well and grew 21.1% driven by significant growth across our 3 largest brands. Having identified plant-based foods as a key trend well before 2019, the Simple Truth Plant Based platform continues to deliver strong growth, growing over 32% in the first quarter. In this way, by consistently delivering both value and innovation, our brands will remain one of our most powerful competitive advantages. Because of the continued economic anxiety, we are still offering our customers value through personalization and promotions, leveraging our mailers, mobile app, website and weekly ads. We continue to offer promotions throughout the quarter with a focus on single-item purchases. \n Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As a result, we have over 2,000 pickup locations and 2,400 delivery locations, reaching 97% of our customers with a seamless customer experience that combines the best of our physical stores with digital. These investments were especially timely as customer adoption of pickup and delivery grew significantly during the pandemic. And because of our existing ecosystem, we were able to respond quickly to further expand and enhance our e-commerce services. We were able to quickly offer and promote in demand no-contact delivery and low contact pickup services. We expanded and improved contact-free payment solutions like Scan, Bag and Go and Kroger Pay. We took several steps to support the higher volume of pickup orders, including hiring additional e-commerce associates, adding more order pickup slots and increasing the frequency of communications with customers. We also began testing a grocery pickup-only location in Cincinnati. All of this contributed to a 92% sales growth in digital channels in the first quarter. In April and May, the sales grew in the top triple digits. \n We continue to invest in and constantly improve our e-commerce capabilities. Our partnership with Ocado remains an essential part of our evolving seamless ecosystem. Our customer fulfillment centers will accelerate our ability to serve customers seamlessly and in a more cost-effective way. Earlier in June, we identified 3 new regions: the Great Lakes, the Pacific Northwest and the West for placement of our high-tech sheds. When operationally, these facilities will collectively create more than 1,000 new jobs with the potential for hundreds of additional career opportunities. \n As we've shared previously, we believe Ocado's value as a partner is not just its current capabilities but also in how quickly the company is able to innovate and rapidly -- sort of rapidly changing consumer markets. We are designing a flexible distribution network, combining disaggregated demand and proximity of our stores, medium-sized facilities and large-sized facilities. You can see this strategy taking shape in the new automated CFCs which will span a range of sizes. The new facility in the West will measure 300,000 square feet. The new facility in the Pacific Northwest will measure 200,000 square feet, and the facility in the Great Lakes region will measure 150,000 square feet. The varying sizes demonstrate the flexibility of the Ocado fulfillment ecosystem to best serve the respective markets. Our network will flex as demand matures and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same day or next day, delivery or pick up and customer or store replenishment. \n Kroger has been investing to raise wages for our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, Kroger is increasing associate wages incrementally by approximately $800 million per year through the end of 2020, and this is $300 million more than the original plan. As a result of this continuing investment, Kroger has increased its average hourly rate to over $15 per hour. And with comprehensive benefits factored in, our average hourly rate is over $20 per hour, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. \n Because of these investments our -- and our established human capital management processes, we were able to expediate our hiring processes in early March to shorten the time between application and employment. Onboarding new hires an average of 72 hours and focusing onboarding on culture and safety, we were able to not only generally protect associate jobs in the face of record unemployment, we also created new jobs and new career opportunities for more than 100,000 workers nationwide. \n Our expediated hiring and onboarding processes also enabled us to focus on associate and customer safety. We were able to direct immediate support to the expansion of Kroger pickup availability as well as an enhanced cleaning and sanitation practices in our stores and facilities where we needed the help the most. Many of those new roles were bridge jobs providing laid-off workers with a stable job opportunity while furloughed from their previous jobs, many of whom are now returning -- starting to return. Additionally, I'm pleased to note an extension of our human capital commitments. We contributed an additional $236 million to multiemployer pension plans in the first quarter. This investment will help stabilize future associate benefits. \n We work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure and the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. Our focus is on developing, training, promoting internal talent while simultaneously hiring seasoned food industry executives to drive our retail supermarket business. \n Kroger remains committed to diversity, equity and inclusion with our workforce. We are creating more opportunities for our associates to openly share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with discrimination and for our company and leaders to more deeply and deliberately listen. We will continue to educate and show our leaders and associates how to be more empathetic, supportive and aware of our own unconscious biases so that, together, we can build a better and more inclusive Kroger. \n COVID-19 also accelerated our commitment to integrated ESG or sustainability practices. What we are seeing in our communities during the pandemic confirms that our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste mission is more relevant than ever. During the pandemic, more than 80 million people in the U.S. lost their jobs and applied for unemployment benefits and/or food assistance. Many more families are struggling to put food on the table today. Kroger is using our philanthropic dollars and foundations to support our food banks and other key partners. Additionally, we are now accepting SNAP/EBT benefits as payment for our pickup service, allowing more customers to access fresh, affordable food through e-commerce. \n We also implemented a dairy rescue support program for farmers. Many farmers and producers did not have a market for their products as foodservice, hospitality and restaurants remain closed. We operate 17 dairies around the country and are uniquely positioned to offer our processing capabilities. Manufacturing and dairy procurement teams rapidly scaled a program to rescue surplus milk donated by Kroger's dairy cooperative suppliers and processed by Kroger-operated dairies and directed it to food banks and families in need. \n Kroger is a trusted brand, and our #1 priority is to be there for our customers, associates and communities. We understand the transition to a new normal will not happen uniformly across the country. As America enters the next phase, we're using our own customer insights and monitoring the impact of affected global markets to help us continue meet customer needs. \n And now I'll turn it over to Gary for more detail into the quarter financials. Gary? Thanks, Gary. I am so proud and deeply grateful for our 0.5 million associates who step forward to be there for our customers and communities when they need us the most. In true Kroger spirit, they have risen to the occasion to each challenge presented with a strong spirit of agility, determination and service to meet the needs of our customers, and these are the exact skills that will ensure the company will remain relevant to our customers in the future. \n As I shared when we first began this call, we quickly had to adapt to a new way of life. We continue to make progress on the underlying business, even with the recent customer demand tailwinds. We are confident that Restock Kroger has allowed us to reposition our business and to create value for all our stakeholders prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n Now we look forward to your questions. I love the question. And if you look at the strategic decisions we've made over the last several years, it highlighted those decisions really paid off in the current environment. Our digital and delivery and pickup business in the last 2 months grew triple digits and continues to grow at that. And to have the ability to grow at that kind of level that quickly, just so proud of the whole team in terms of the foundations that were already in place but also the stores and all the other parts and supply chain on being able to supply and hire people and support that. So we fundamentally believe the long-term trend will continue where people will continually depend more on e-commerce. We certainly have seen that be accelerated. We don't think it will stay at the higher level where it is today permanently, but we do think, fundamentally, the growth has been accelerated and will be higher than where it started before COVID-19 and then grow from there. \n One of the things that's incredibly important is all the pieces tied together, including Ocado, will allow us to continue to grow and improve our profitability of that part of the business. As you know, when a customer first switches to online, it typically takes 3 or 4 years before that customer's profitability is the same as when they shop in the store. But what we find is we get a significantly higher share of that customer's total household spend. And there isn't anything that we've seen that wouldn't cause us to believe that the new e-commerce shopper doesn't feel that way, and a lot of those customers are telling us they intend to continue to shop more e-commerce than before, and we would expect to get a higher share of their business. \n We've also seen a lot of customers new to Kroger come and use our delivery and pickup business, and we're seeing nice repeat purchases from those customers. So all those things cause us to feel good about the things we have in place and feel even better about Ocado and the other pieces that we're working on going forward. It's each customer's household. So if you look, obviously, when they first switched to e-commerce, we're spending the labor to pick their order, where before that, the customer spent that labor. What we find is, over time, we continue to get more efficient with our picking operations on picking an order, and the customer spends more money with us, so their total spend increases. So what we find is every -- you'd have to look at every single customer separately. So the customers that first started shopping e-commerce 3 years ago, they're to the point now where their profitability is the same as before they went to e-commerce, but we're getting a higher percentage of their spend. And looking forward, we believe we'll be able to continue to reduce the cost to serve that customer. A new customer starts day 1, so you have that headwind until we are able to earn more of their total household spend. And what we find is we're able to do that. Yes. If you look, delivery was a higher growth than pickup, especially during the peak of the COVID cases. As areas have reopened and companies have reopened their offices and things like that, the growths are starting to get more similar. \n Gary, on the growth, I'll let you answer the growth and the changes there. One other comment, Ed, on the first part of your question, and it's hard to assign specific numbers and specific numbers just for the second quarter versus third quarter, fourth quarter and even 2021. But when we talk to customers, we -- our customers still tell us they plan to eat more meals at home than before. When talking to customers about when their children return to schools, we still have a significantly higher percentage of families telling us they plan to make breakfast for the kids to take to school and lunch for the kids to take to school. All of those things in terms of what customers are telling us, we would expect there'll be more meals eaten at home or prepared at home that obviously will help support growth as well. Well, if you look in terms of overall, digital would have been, I don't know, probably 6.5% or 7% of the total company. It would have been predominantly pickup versus delivery in terms of the mix, but the percentage growth was higher on delivery. So -- and if you look at -- the other thing on delivery, a lot is delivered directly to people's homes, either through FedEx or UPS. And that's basically the similar number is what is delivered via Instacart and other services. \n On the other piece, Gary, I'll let you answer Karen's other. Yes. We love the question, and it's something that we're spending a ton of resources. We had as many new customers come to us in a couple of weeks as what we did all of last year, and we continue to have a lot of new customers. So we're using all the things that we would normally do on welcoming new customers in but doing it in a much more aggressive way. Obviously, one of the things that we want to make sure is they have a great experience. So if you look at our supply chain team working with our merchants, we're getting the stores inventories back up to pre-COVID levels. So the in-stock position improves. The continued focus on fresh and continuing to even -- fresh was a priority already, but making sure that the products that customers get stays fresh and then with a friendly smile or an incredibly easy digital experience. \n So your question, we love, it's the opportunity that we have in front of us. So far, we've been able to gain good market share during the pandemic. And obviously, we're going to continue to focus on making sure we take care of those customers and keep them and continue to build their basket in terms of what they spend with us versus other places. And we would expect to continue to do promotions. And one of the things when you look at the details behind first quarter, almost basically all the gross margin improvement was driven by leverages and marketing expense from the higher sales, warehouse and transportation and shrink, and our team had incredible strong quarter on shrink. So it's really those leverage, and we would expect continue to have some of those leverage benefits at the higher sales that we're expecting. It's a great question. And I can tell you before COVID-19, our digital business has become a tailwind in terms of the incremental improvement from where it was before. And as we look forward, we would expect as customers mature that, that would still be the case. And that's going to be a combination of customer spending -- and I'm talking about in total, not just the new customers by themselves. In total, as that customer continues to give us more of their total share of spend for a household and as our teams continue to take costs out in terms of serving that customer and as our Ocado sheds begin to take -- come online and some of the other facilities to supply our customers, we would expect that digital will be a tailwind for us as we move forward, and it's really just the fact that the business basically doubled overnight. It's really if you look -- as we've been working on it in total, and Ocado has done a lot of work to be able to get the economics viable for a smaller shed, over time, that will allow us to go into smaller markets with those -- with sheds as well. So it's part of the overall supply chain design, and it's playing out as we expected. And Ocado is continuing to up their game as well. So it's really the experience. We're looking forward to Ocado's sheds opening up in Canada and France, and that will provide an additional set of learnings as well. Yes. The -- overall, we're still seeing people shop at fewer stores and, as Gary mentioned, a large spend per basket. If you look at the department, that's probably the easiest directly to talk about is our deli department. And our deli department, the trends over the last 4 or 5 weeks have been significantly improved from where it was in the height of the lockdowns. We would expect a lot of those meals are things where people are preparing at home and taking to work. Our customers tell us they're still minimizing the different places they go and minimizing their exposure. So that's something that we want to make sure that we're there for the customer. Yes. The -- first of all, if you look at things that we think, for sure, is the digital channel and people eating via that accelerated the trends that we're already on. If you look at like our Home Chef business, they had an incredible quarter with picking up new customers as well. \n The thing that I get most hopeful about is when we talk to customers, customers tell us they like eating at home as a family and eating together and having meals together at home. And one of our responsibilities is to help them keep it fresh and innovative and new ideas, and we continue to work on that. But everything that we can see, the customer likes that, and they like learning how to cook and cook as a family. So that trend is something that we focus on a lot and try to make sure we're supportive of it. Yes. One of the things that I'm super proud of our teams is we've had an ad and promoted every week during the pandemic to try to help our customers' budget go as far as possible. The only change that we made was we stopped doing the buy 10 for 10s and things like that, that incentivized multiple purchases on items that we're in short supply because we wanted to support as many customers as possible, getting those. \n We would continue to use our data to understand what's important to the customer and some customers are in different financial situations, whether they lost their jobs or they were able to work from home. And we're supporting both of those customer segments with promotions, loyalty mailings and other offers that are 1:1, in addition to what you can see in an ad, and we think that's an important component to continue to support. I think it's too early to tell for sure, and those were states where people were more comfortable going out, anyway, even during lockdowns. So it's really early to -- but we're really not seeing massive shift changes. \n One last question. Yes. Yes. If you look at -- on the ticket growth, we had significant double-digit increases in the average basket size. And we're finding that customers are going into the store less frequently, and so well over 100% of the growth is driven by basket size. If you look at new customers and existing customers, it's a meaningful number, but it's maybe 1/4 or 1/3 of the total when you look at all the pieces because we also have a lot of new customers to pick up and where we've launched where customers can pay a SNAP at pickup and things like that, new customers there as well. Yes. The -- that's a question, obviously, we're spending a lot of time internally talking through and trying to understand as well. The thing that, Gary talked about it a little bit, but if you look at -- we would expect '21 to be better than what the trend would have been for '21 before COVID, and Gary mentioned that briefly in answering one of the other questions. So everything that we can see, we believe there are certainly meaningful shifts in the way people eat. I won't say permanent but certainly multiyear and that we would expect '21 to be better than what '21 would have been before COVID. \n To give more specifics than that, I think it's hard to say. As we get to next year, one of the things that we would expect is, certainly, in-stock positions will be better, which will be helpful, but people will be going back to a normal life more so as well. So we're going to do everything we can to make sure we're taking care of the customers we have and getting more of their share in the new customers. And the easiest point of context is just we would expect '21 to be better than what '21 would have been pre-COVID. \n Thanks, Michael. Appreciate it. I think the last question was a great question to end on. If you look at Restock Kroger and the work from Restock Kroger certainly position the Kroger well to deal, and we had good growth before COVID, and COVID certainly accelerated the infrastructure and foundations we had in place. And as we look to 2021, we would expect that to be better than what it was before COVID. \n The other comment that I want to make is, as you know, we always like to share a few final comments directed toward our associates and how we live our purpose every day. The senseless killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and so many more, too many more across our country have shaken me to the core. We share in everyone's feelings of sadness and outrage for the victims and their families. I am compelled to use Kroger's voice to express that we're against racism and the injustice toward the Black community. To become a greater part of the solution, we believe the most important next step is to listen. \n Recently, I was proud to be invited by Dr. Bernice King of The King Center to listen, learn and participate in open dialogue about how companies like ours can drive real tangible change. We also held the first of several listening sessions to hear directly from our associates about how we can better support them. Informed by deliberate listening, we intend to take more action. As the first step, our company is establishing a $5 million fund to support the advancement of racial equality and justice. This new investment will be earmarked within The Kroger Foundation for improving diversity, equity and inclusion. We know there's more work to be done, and we will continue to share our progress. \n Thank you for all you have done and will do for each other and our customers and communities. And to all on the call, thank you for joining our call today. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before discussing results for the quarter, I also want to thank our associates for their dedication and all they are doing to serve our customers and communities during this time. The pandemic brought unprecedented challenges, and I'm extremely proud of how our teams responded as America relied on Kroger as a trusted resource for their food and essential needs. As a result of the pandemic, we have seen elevated demand across our physical stores and digital channels. Our data insights show customers continue to value the convenience of our physical locations and the ease of our seamless ecosystem. \n As many of you know, we outlined our Restock Kroger transformation plan in 2017. And as part of that plan, we made the strategic decision to invest in digital. These investments allowed us to quickly add much needed capacity to serve our customers by scaling the foundational capabilities we have built and continue to develop. The outcome of these efforts has been a meaningful uplift in sales across all digital modalities: Kroger pickup, delivery and ship. \n We made significant investments of more than $830 million in the quarter to reward associates and safeguard associates, customers and communities during the pandemic. We also contribute to $236 million to multiemployer pension plans to help stabilize future associate benefits. Even with these significant investments and accelerated digital growth, we were pleased to achieve an improvement in FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We firmly believe that our ongoing investments will help Kroger emerge stronger, and it's clear from our recent customer data insights that our competitive modes, fresh, our brands, personalization and a seamless ecosystem, are even more important as a new normal begins to emerge in food retail. \n Now I'd like to discuss our quarterly results in more detail. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $1.22 per diluted share. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 19% during the first quarter. Unprecedented demand for products across grocery and fresh departments led to these strong results. Sales were broadly based across all retail divisions and remained heightened throughout the quarter as customers adjusted to the new restrictions and started preparing and eating more meals at home. Leading into the pandemic, our sales were strong, building momentum from the second half of 2019, February identical supermarket sales, without fuel, were ahead of our internal expectations. \n During the last few days of February, we started to see a shift in customer behavior as shoppers started stockpiling, and that trend accelerated into March with identical sales of approximately 30%. Sales remained elevated in April and May, both up approximately 20% as customers continue to eat more at home. In the first few weeks of the second quarter, we are starting to see some changes in demand with sales growth becoming more balanced across the store as state restrictions have started to ease. Customers remain focused on health and safety and are still stocking up but to a lesser degree than during the shutdowns. We are also starting to see a return to some splurge and impulse buying. Customers are still cooking more at home, even with the easing restrictions and identical sales, so far in the second quarter, are trending in the mid-teens. We do expect sales to continue to taper as the quarter progresses. \n Digital sales grew 92% and contributed slightly over 3% to identical sales without fuel. New customer engagement with our pickup and delivery services spiked significantly during the quarter, and we have been encouraged by early customer repeat usage. Digital sales in the second quarter remain elevated, up triple digits in the first 3 weeks. We continue to invest in digital and offered a fee-free pickup promotion to provide more value for our customers in ways that are most relevant at this time. We were also excited to announce several new enhancements to our digital customer experience, including the launch of our check-in on arrival option for pickup customers and the launch of contactless doorstep delivery. \n Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the first quarter was $1.45 billion compared to $957 million in the first quarter of 2019. Gross margin was 24.3% of sales for the first quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 44 basis points due to sales leverage related to shrink, transportation, warehousing and advertising costs. Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which saw significant improvement in the first quarter compared to last year. The OG&A rate increased 51 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. No adjustment was made to this number for COVID-19-related costs. \n As previously mentioned, during the quarter, Kroger made the decision to contribute an incremental $236 million to multiemployer pension plans. Excluding the incremental pension contribution, fuel and adjustment items, the OG&A rate improved 10 basis points. Rent and depreciation, excluding fuel, decreased 37 basis points due to sales leverage. We do expect some COVID-related costs to continue beyond the first quarter as we continue to invest in associate and customer safety as well as support heightened digital demand. \n We also made the decision to delay certain Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives to allow our associates to focus on our most important priorities: safety and stocking shelves. We have now started to reintroduce the delayed initiatives while also maintaining our commitment to associate and customer safety. We still expect to achieve the vast majority of the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020. \n Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. We saw a significant decline in gallons during the quarter as with the national trend. We remain well positioned within our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and market-leading reward program. The average retail price of fuel was $2.13 this quarter versus $2.62 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the first quarter was $0.48 compared to $0.23 in the same quarter last year. And as a result, fuel profitability was a major tailwind in the quarter. For the remainder of 2020, we expect fuel profitability to be a headwind compared to prior year as we cycle margins from 2019, and gallons continue to be impacted by COVID-19. \n Kroger's alternative profit model is built from a platform of leveraging supermarket traffic and data and is expected to achieve profit growth in 2020. \n During the first quarter, Kroger Personal Finance experienced lower transactions as customers purchase less gift cards, money services and lottery. Customer activity has started to improve since April as states have reopened. And while we would expect this trend to continue, KPF profit is expected to be lower than our original expectations for 2020. \n Media experienced a slowdown in late March and April as campaigns were paused to refocus messaging on store and employee safety and certain in-store programs were impacted by stay-at-home orders. Our Media business rebounded strongly in May, and the strength of our digital sales growth has created significant momentum for Kroger Precision Marketing, which is now on track to achieve 50% growth in 2020. We remain confident in the significant potential of alternative profits, especially given the continued growth in traffic across our store and digital ecosystem. Despite short-term headwinds due to COVID-19, we continue to expect alternative profit to be a major accelerator of our model in the future. \n As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Food 4 Less California and South Carolina during the first quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Roanoke, Little Rock and Houston, as well as Dallas meat clocks.\n Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations later in the year, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Charleston, West Virginia and Fry's associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. \n Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way which will help create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. \n Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain strong liquidity. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend over time. We are being disciplined in how we deploy capital, and all aspects of our capital plan are being evaluated to make sure that our investments position Kroger for long-term success post COVID-19. We still expect total capital expenditure of between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion in 2020. \n Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio is 1.81 compared to 2.54 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Kroger held temporary cash investments of approximately $2.3 billion as of the end of the quarter, reflecting improvements in operating performance and significant improvements in working capital. We expect working capital to improve for the year, although not to the level experienced in the first quarter, which was inflated by the extraordinary sales growth due to COVID-19. \n Given the uncertainties that remain related to COVID-19 and the outlook for the remainder of 2020, we believe it's prudent to maintain financial flexibility in the short term. We remain committed to our dividend and share repurchase program. And in the coming months, we will also be evaluating the optimal use of any excess free cash flow, consistent with our previously stated capital allocation strategy. \n Turning now to guidance for 2020. The COVID pandemic has dramatically changed the outlook for food retail, and we continue to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. There are still many unknown factors related to the long-term impact of COVID-19 that could influence our financial results for the remainder of 2020, such as continued investments to help our customers and associates; uncertainty surrounding consumer behavior, restrictions and what will be the new normal; and potential long-term shift in customers eating more food at home. \n In recognition of these factors, it's difficult to predict specific outcomes. And as such, Kroger is not reaffirming or providing new 2020 guidance. While we do expect to exceed the outlook shared in our April 1 business update for identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit, adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow, the company is not able to forecast the extent of such upside for the reasons mentioned. As we continue to proactively adjust our plans in response to the pandemic, we remain committed to investing to ensure a safe environment for our associates and customers, and we will also continue to use our customer insights to invest in delivering greater value for customers in ways they value most and that build loyalty. \n Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We remain confident in our business model as well as our ability to generate strong free cash flow and achieve sustainable and attractive total shareholder returns. \n In the second quarter, we expect identical sales, excluding fuel, to continue at elevated levels, although tapering from the trends we've experienced so far in the quarter. We expect EPS growth in the second quarter to be in the mid- to high single-digit range with tailwinds in the supermarket sales, partially offset by continued investments and fuel headwinds. As the longer-term impact of COVID-19 becomes clearer, we are committed to providing more clarity on our expectations for the remainder of the year. \n I'll now turn it back to Rodney. Yes. I think the biggest factor, Rupesh, would be that -- I mentioned it earlier, but just to maybe to give a bit more color on fuel for quarter 1 and how we see quarter 2 potentially shaping up because that would be the -- I think the biggest factor in the numbers. Overall, as I mentioned earlier, when we think about the supermarket business, we're expecting continued strong sales momentum, and we feel good about the ability to manage the margin and the investments that we'll continue to make as a result of COVID-19. \n I think the biggest factor and the difference between the 2 quarters as we look at the guidance for the second quarter, in the first quarter, fuel has been a significant tailwind for us overall despite the fact that gallons were significantly lower through COVID. As we start to look at Q2, and we'll be cycling margins from Q2 last year, and even though the fuel trend in gallons has continued to gradually get better every week, we're still seeing a decline in year-over-year gallons. And the current trend would be in the sort of mid-teens range of negative growth in gallons, which is consistent with what's being seen in the market. \n So as we look at the fuel performance in Q2 and what we see today, we're thinking that could be a headwind of anywhere between $50 million to $100 million. So it would be important to think about that as you're thinking about the guidance that we shared for Q2 because that would be the -- I think the primary factor that would despite the continued growth and improvement in performance that we'd expect over the original budget in the supermarket business. Hope that helped. Sure, yes. Thanks for the question. I would say that the way that we see the digital customer behavior flow through in the P&L, it's not a meaningfully different mix in terms of overall pass-through in gross margin rates. Rodney's point earlier, generally, we see customers increase their spend. The basket size increases, and the mix is pretty consistent. The area that would have impacted gross margin would have been more in the fact that we run the fee waiver promotion. So that would have certainly been a headwind in the gross margin category. \n Really, where we see the bigger impact on digital is Rodney's earlier response around the incremental labor that's involved in picking the order. So if you think about the pass-through rate that we might see on a traditional sale through the store, which we've talked about historically being the 15% plus range, it would be significantly lower than that on the equivalent basis because you've got the incremental labor associated with those sales. So it would be more of an impact in the OG&A rate than it would be in gross margin when you think about the quarter. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. There's a couple of parts for that, obviously. I think in terms of sales, as we shared in our brief prepared comments on sales, we're obviously watching the trends very closely. Part of the challenge is it's very hard to know obviously exactly how we expect the customer behavior to return back to whatever a new normal becomes. We certainly expect as states have reopened to start to see a gradual return to some level of lower food eaten at home, but we do think that's going to be more gradual than a specific stair step-down. We're starting to see some change in Q2, as we mentioned during the prepared comments, and -- but it's not really sort of a specific step-down when states have reopened. It's much more of a gradual process as you start to see customers returning to some level of normal behavior. \n I would also say it's not very consistent. It's not as though states that reopened first are seeing the bigger step-down. It's relatively more tied to when states first experienced a major outbreak of COVID from what we can see and also depending on how aggressive the spike in sales were in that market when the outbreak first happened. That's tending to more correlate with the gradual change in shopping behavior. \n So we're watching it very closely. We are starting to see visit frequency pick up a bit. We're seeing more of the departments that might be more splurge I mentioned earlier growing like daily baker and specialty cheese and floral, but it really is a gradual process. And I think we still say it's too early at the moment, only a few weeks in to know. So we're expecting it to be a gradual step-down from where we ended Q1 and the trend that we shared so far in Q2. And obviously, we're watching it very closely and maintaining flexibility to make sure we're winning every dollar from a customer perspective around how we make sure we're continuing to grow market share and grow share of wallet. \n From a gross margin perspective, obviously, we haven't gone into a specific guidance around what we would expect to see there. We continue to invest in promotions, as Rodney shared, and we certainly expect that to become more and more normal as we go through the year now that the supply chain is starting to normalize, but there are still going to be some areas where it will be more difficult to promote where there are still some overhangs of supply issues in certain categories. \n On the COVID-related costs, it really -- if you think about breaking down the total OG&A expense in Q1, it's really 3 buckets I would kind of categorize it into. The first would be the COVID-specific costs around the $830 million that we talked about, obviously, in the press release and the prepared comments. The majority of that was around rewarding our associates and making sure that they shared in the success of the quarter. And then there were also some costs associated with incremental labor for cleaning and PPE equipment. We'd certainly be expecting some of those costs to continue as we go through the year with safety being the top priority. We're also obviously investing in labor in supporting our digital growth, and we'd expect that labor to continue as we continue to win that customer and make sure that we're winning their overall loyalty. And the third major cost in OG&A, obviously, with the pension contribution, which we wouldn't be expecting to repeat. \n So I think it's really in OG&A. The cost that will flow through are going to be the safety and cleaning costs that we'd expect to continue to be investing in and the incremental labor associated with supporting digital growth going forward. That's right. So think of it as it's a green status plan. It's over 80% funded, so there's not an obligation for us to make that payment. But obviously, it's something that we're committed to making sure that, long term, we're securing that future liquidity of the plant. And especially during times like this when there's market volatility, sometimes there could be pressure on those plans to have to liquidate assets to be able to make contributions, and we wanted to make sure that the plans were not put in that risk. So we decided to basically invest those dollars now to protect the future. And obviously, over time, that will derisk the need for us to have to invest, but it wasn't a requirement to make those payments. That's correct. Yes. The only way that we would approach those examples would be if we identified an opportunity to be able to pull away from the multiemployer plans and bring them into the same way that we run that UFCW plan if there was a -- if it made sense for us to do that from an investor and associate perspective because we could derisk the future liabilities and be able to take more control of that potential exposure in the future But we have no obligation on those, unless we were to make -- take that action like we did with the plan you described earlier. That's right. Exactly, yes. That's fully funded. Yes. So it depends on which piece of the plan, just to clarify, Karen, you're talking about. So as Ed mentioned a moment ago, we have a multiemployer plans that we separated and we now manage internally. And as I mentioned earlier, they would be in the green status, so there'd be no obligation for us to be making those payments, but we're obviously looking to get them over time a fully funded status and to minimize the risk to associates. So think about that as it's minimizing. If returns weren't where they needed to be, it minimizes the risk as of us having to make contributions in the future and ensures those pension plans are in a strong position for our associates. \n The multiemployer plans that we're a participant in but we don't have a current obligation to fund beyond the annual contributions that we're making through our negotiated contracts with the unions, that would be an exposure as of the end of last year and as we reported in the 10-K, $2.3 billion or $1.8 million after tax. And they're ones where, over time, we would certainly look at if there are options to figure out different ways to structure our arrangements so that we can address those liabilities, but they would be very specifically defined and ring-fenced transactions that we would obviously share publicly in the future, if we were to decide that was the right thing to do. Expense related to what, I'm sorry, Karen, I'm not sure I'm following. Yes. So we -- as I mentioned, we would have pension expense related to our multiemployer plans that we pay into as part of the negotiated contracts with the unions. And obviously, where we need to continue to fund the plan that's internal, we'll make those contributions when we need to. But we -- obviously, that can vary significantly. But most of the most of the pull -- if I call it, pull forward may be a potential liability in the future, it doesn't relate to what we would do in 2020. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Sorry, we were all looking to get the digital number for you there, Karen. Can you repeat the second part of the question? Yes. So as I mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, we -- certainly, we're thrilled with the cash balance that we generated during the quarter. Part of that does reflect the improved operating performance. Part of it was a significant improvement in working capital. We want to make sure that, obviously, we maintain maximum flexibility in the short term, just with some of the uncertainty that still exists in the market. And we also want to make sure we understand how much of the working capital benefit will continue because we do believe we've made strong progress on working capital over the last really 12 months to 18 months as we've continued to look at ways to free up cash flow, but some elements of that will be inflated, just because of the higher sales in the first quarter and the way our working capital cycle works. And some of it is also related to the CARES Act, where there's a delay in certain tax payments as part of the way that the CARES Act was structured. So we would expect as a result of all of that still to generate incremental free cash flow this year. \n As we go through the next couple of months, we're really going to focus on what do we think is the optimal way to use that cash flow consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy that we shared with you in our Investor Day in November. So think about is we'll look at are there opportunities where we could continue to invest in the business to drive longer-term growth. We'll certainly be looking at are there any reasons to restructure any of the pension future MEPP liabilities that would allow us to take that potential liability and risk off the table longer term. And then, of course, we'll also be looking at how might we redeploy that cash to our shareholders consistent with our strategy of continuing to grow our dividend over time but also looking at buybacks to shareholders as well. Judah, the only thing I would add is that, to your point around data, we spent a lot of time looking at the data that we have and also the data that's available in the marketplace over the last 20 years from whether it's government data, more broad market data, along with our own shopping information, and really looking at what are the scenarios around where we see the customer going over, to your point, not really the next sort of month or 2 but the rest of the year and into next year and maybe even further out. \n We do feel from everything that we see that we're putting ourselves in a strong position based on the investments that we're making as part of Restock Kroger to come out the other side of this in a stronger place. And everything that we see, while this obviously no one knows and it's hard to predict, would say that based on the -- less around maybe the pandemic but just on generally when customers are in more of an economically challenged situation and combining that with these restrictions, we do think there'll be some level of a -- I won't call it a permanent shift but a multiple-year shift to food eaten at home versus food away from home, and that's been very much the case in our data and the external data when you look at the last couple of recessions. \n So our focus is very much on how do we make sure we're using personalization and tools and our strategy around creating value to really make sure that as we look out 12, 18 months, we come out of this in a stronger position, both in customers consuming more food at home but also Kroger's market share, so that it allows us to accelerate our overall long-term model around Restock Kroger but also delivering shareholder value. And we feel very positive about the way in which we believe we can deliver that over longer term. I think it's easier to look at the longer term in some ways than it is probably for the next 6 months and how exactly the trends will play out. Sure. On the pension side, yes, so the payment that we're making in Q2 is a discrete payment that we -- sorry, in Q1, I'm sorry, that we deliberately took the decision as we were in a strong position from a performance perspective and a cash flow perspective. We have no obligation to make that payment. It doesn't cause us to have to make payments later in the year or that we are obligated to some additional commitments later in the year. It was very much a decision that we made to take advantage of the strong performance and essentially protect that future risk and make sure that our associates' pension plans are in a strong position. So it's very much more of a forward-looking view of saying let's make sure we're putting ourselves and putting our associates in a position where we're protecting the future when we have the opportunity to do so. \n From a gross margin perspective, yes, certainly, I think on the alternative profit side, I mentioned it earlier. On the Media business, we're seeing a tremendous pickup in growth. So I wouldn't believe that we would see any headwinds from media. That's continuing to bounce back very strongly from a very temporary delay that we experienced in the first quarter, really during the lockdown period and as things were reset. Kroger Personal Finance is the biggest element of alternative profit from a profit contribution perspective, and that is sort of more, I guess, dependent on some of the broader recovery in the market when you think about gift card sales, restaurants are an important part of that category. \n And when you think about credit card spend, those elements are all tied to continued improvement in the economic situation. So while we are still able to tap into opportunity in KPF because we have low penetration of our customer base, we would expect that to continue to be a headwind in terms of impacting gross margin and performance for the year. But media, certainly, we wouldn't have that same view there. I think the other thing I would add, Rodney, is that we mentioned earlier around the pickup fee being an investment in price with the promotion there. But also, we did adapt our plan around making sure we're giving value to customers where product was more available. And so the team did a really nice job in promoting on HBC and general merchandise products. And while it's very true to say that grocery and fresh led the way, we saw significant double-digit growth in both of those categories and would have seen some lower gross margin in those 2 categories because we were more promotional in making sure that as being a business that was opened through the pandemic that we were delivering value for customers. I think that's been -- the team did a really nice job of making sure we were creating value there and delivering value there."

During 2021, our team delivered for all stakeholders by, first of all, achieving positive year-over-year identicals without fuel against very strong identicals last year and a 2-year stack of 14.3%.  \n Also by connecting with customers through expanding our seamless ecosystem and remarkable, consistent delivery of full fresh and friendly customer experience for everyone, plus investing more than ever before in our associates to raise our average hourly rate to $17 and our average hourly rate to over $22 when you include [ compensation ] and benefits as well. We balance all of these investments by achieving cost savings of greater than $1 billion for the fourth consecutive year, and alternative profits contributed an incremental $150 million of operating profit as well. \n As we look to 2022, we expect the momentum in our business to continue, and we have confidence in our ability to navigate a rapidly changing operating environment. We are leveraging technology, innovation and our competitive moats to build lasting competitive advantages. Our balanced model is allowing us to deliver for shareholders, invest in our associates, continue to provide fresh, affordable food for our customers and support for our communities.  \n We remain confident in our growth model and our ability to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. Kroger is leading with fresh. Our fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales, excluding fuel, during the fourth quarter. Kroger remains the #1 retailer in many exciting areas such as specialty cheese, sushi and floral. As the world's largest florist, we sold over 76 million floral stems for Valentine's Day alone. And the smiles that came along with that for our customers and associates were free.  \n We advanced our fresh strategy and strengthened our fresh offerings in 2021 by launching our Go Fresh & Local Supplier Accelerator, supporting our commitment to small businesses. As a result of the launch, we have brought a number of new products to customers, and the initial results have exceeded our expectations. We are still early in the program, and we will continue to partner with small businesses to expand our pipeline of new products. We also remain a leader in innovation through exciting partnerships with companies like Kitchen United and Kipster. We've completed the initial test phase of our End-to-End Fresh initiatives focused on bringing more days of freshness to our customers and are confident in its scalability and with plans to expand to targeted stores across the country.  \n Our brands continue to resonate strongly with customers and maintains a culture of innovation, launching over 660 new items during the year. More than half of those new items were within our Simple Truth and Private Selection portfolios. We accelerated Home Chef's incredible milestone of becoming a billion-dollar brand, our fourth greater-than-$1 billion brand, which is pretty special. As a reminder for everyone, we merged with Home Chef in 2018. At the time, we knew our customers were looking for ways to make meal time easier without compromising on taste or freshness.  \n While Home Chef originated as a pure-play e-commerce offering, we saw immense potential to integrate and leverage it across our seamless ecosystem, scaling it within our stores and continuing to grow online. The success of this integration demonstrates our ability to integrate and scale solutions that provide value to our customers and grow our competitive moats.  \n Kroger is focused on delivering a seamless experience that requires 0 compromise by customers, and I think that's a really important point, 0 compromise required by customers. And what that means is the freshest products at competitive prices and flexible lead times. Yael will go into a lot more detail tomorrow on what 0 compromise means for our customers at our business update.  \n The strength in our top line sales in 2021 demonstrates our ability to meet our customers no matter how they choose to engage with us, whether it's in-store or online. At the same time, we are actively encouraging customers to engage with us on our digital platforms, even when shopping in store. That's because when a customer engages with us digitally, they spend more with Kroger within all modalities.  \n We continue to attract new customers to our digital platforms. During the quarter, we saw new seamless pickup and delivery to household acquisitions increased 25% compared to the third quarter. We remain committed to doubling digital sales and profitability by 2023, which was announced in 2021. We look forward to sharing our glide path to this goal with you tomorrow. We do not expect digital growth will be linear, especially as we cycle the sales spike in 2020 and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again.  \n We are incredibly proud of the new digital modalities we launched during 2021, including Kroger Delivery Now, our Boost membership program and the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers, all of which we expect to contribute meaningfully to our long-term goals. Yesterday, we announced a new customer fulfillment center for the Cleveland region, following on heels of our announcement of a cross-dock spoke facility that will serve Oklahoma City. And just a few weeks ago, we opened our third customer fulfillment center in Forest Park, Georgia and are leveraging learnings from Monroe and Groveland to drive efficiencies and scale in the new facility. Customers are loving this new offering, and we continue to be pleased with the initial rollout of our facilities in Groveland and Monroe, and we look forward to sharing additional insights tomorrow.  \n Now turning to the supply chain. Our teams across our stores, warehouses, plants and offices have been incredible in working together to supply fresh food and necessities for our customers while addressing the rapidly changing environment. During the quarter, industry challenges continued within the supply chain, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenges. Within our supply chain, we continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet. We are also partnering with our suppliers to improve product availability using the strength of our data science teams to provide insights that shorten lead times and optimize inventory flow across the extended supply chain.  \n We continue to focus on expanding our transportation contracts and attracting carriers from outside our industry, which has kept product flowing predictably across our network. The teams are doing a great job managing the increased costs, and the trends within our costs are improving sequentially. We are using our data and supplier data plus leveraging technology to support future growth. We expect the supply chain to continue to improve throughout the year as a result of our actions.  \n When I visit our stores, I often hear from our associates that what they love most about their job is that they can positively impact the lives of our customers, communities and each other every day. And it's also what I love about our business too. And it's what makes our purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit, so vital for our people. One way we live our purpose is through progress toward our ESG goals and our commitments. As part of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan, last year, Kroger donated 499 million meals, that's right, 499 million meals, to feed hungry families across America. And we continue to make progress toward our goal of 0 waste.  \n As part of our commitments to helping people live healthier lives, we've administrated almost 11 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine through Kroger Health. For our more than 450,000 associates, we strive to create a culture of opportunity, and we take seriously our role as a leading employer in the United States. Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first jobs, new beginnings and lifelong careers.  \n As we continue to operate in a challenging labor market, we are dedicated to attracting and retaining the right talent across the organization to be able to continue delivering for our customers. We are investing more than ever before in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness as well as the continued investment in wages that I mentioned earlier. This is enabling us to navigate current labor conditions while continuing to provide America with the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem.  \n We are cultivating an environment where all associates are able to thrive. For the fourth year in a row, Kroger earned top score in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index, the nation's benchmark in measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Last year alone, we provided more than $5 million to support associates through unexpected hardships through our Helping Hands Fund. This includes providing critical funds for disaster relief for nearly 1,300 associates.  \n 2021 was an incredible year for Kroger, and we are committed to continued growth. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our relentless focus on learning and improving every day. I believe this has been a key on navigating our business successfully in every operating environment. We remain customer-obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. And now I'd like to turn it over to Gary. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger continues to execute at a high level and is delivering exceptional results while navigating a rapidly changing environment. Before I get into our results in more detail, I would like to start by echoing Rodney's appreciation to our fantastic associates. Their dedication to serve our customers and support each other throughout the pandemic has been nothing short of incredible.  \n Our performance last year clearly highlights the strength of Kroger's go-to-market strategy as we achieved positive identical sales without fuel and adjusted EPS growth on top of record results in 2020. We also continued to invest in our customers and associates to ensure Kroger is well positioned for future success. These investments were balanced with over $1 billion in cost savings and $150 million of incremental operating profit from alternative profit streams.  \n I will now provide additional color on our full year results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $3.68 per diluted share, up 6% compared to last year. Identical sales, excluding fuel, were positive 0.2% and digital sales on a 2-year stacked basis grew by 113%. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $4.3 billion, up 6% over 2020. Gross margin was 22% of sales for 2021. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 43 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and strategic price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits and growth in alternative profits.  \n The OG&A rate decreased 61 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items, reflecting a reduction in COVID-related costs and cost saving initiatives, partially offset by significant investments in our associates.  \n Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.91 for the quarter, up 12% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 4%, our strongest quarter of the year, with fresh departments leading the way. Kroger's FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 3 basis points compared to the same period last year. The stability in our gross margin rate reflects effective management of cost inflation and sourcing benefits, offset by strategic price investments and higher supply chain costs. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 7 basis points. This was driven by significant investments in our associates, including a year-end associate thank you reward and various asset impairments, offset by decreased COVID-related costs, sales leverage and cost saving initiatives.  \n The LIFO charge for the fourth quarter was $20 million compared to an $84 million credit in the same period last year and represented an $0.11 headwind to EPS in the quarter. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher inflation in most categories, with grocery and meat being the largest contributors. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to successfully navigate many different operating environments, and our team is doing an excellent job managing the current higher inflationary environment. We continue to leverage our data and work closely with our suppliers to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model. We are investing where it matters most to our customers using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization.  \n Our brands is also an important differentiator for Kroger in this environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great quality and great value. Our strategic approach is helping our customers manage their grocery budgets more effectively and is allowing Kroger to maintain a strong price position relative to our key competitors.  \n Fuel also remains an important part of our overall value proposition for our customers, and we continue to invest in our fuel program in 2021. Customers that redeem fuel points spend, on average, 4x more at Kroger and visit 4x more frequently. Our investment in fuel rewards, which is reflected in our supermarket gross margin, also helps customers stretch their dollars further and allowed us to achieve gallon growth of 5% in the fourth quarter, outpacing market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.30 this quarter versus $2.20 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.44 compared to $0.33 in the same quarter in 2020.  \n Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. Our operating results generated exceptional free cash flow in 2021, which resulted in a further strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.63 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. We were also disciplined in accelerating the return of cash to shareholders in 2021. In total, Kroger returned $2.2 billion to investors via a combination of share repurchases and dividends.  \n I'd now like to take a few minutes to discuss our continued commitment to investing in our associates and our deep experience with collective bargaining. Wages at Kroger grew before and during the pandemic. As you know, we committed to significant associate wage investments when we launched our Restock Kroger program at the end of 2017. Kroger has invested an incremental $1.2 billion in associate wages and training over the last 4 years. In addition, we have committed to invest over $1.8 billion during the same time period to help address underfunding and better secure pensions for tens of thousands of associates.  \n Wage, health care and pensions are included in all of the more than 350 collective bargaining agreements that cover approximately 66% of our associates. These contracts are regularly negotiated by our professional labor relations team. Our objective is to negotiate contracts that balance competitive wage increases and affordable health care for associates with keeping groceries affordable for the communities that we serve. Our obligation is to do this in a way that maintains a financially sustainable business. If negotiations do become contentious, we have contingency plans in place to continue to support our communities.  \n During the fourth quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Fred Meyer, King Soopers and our Michigan division, covering more than 20,500 associates. For 2022, we have contract negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Las Vegas, Southern California, Seattle, Indianapolis, Portland, Columbus, Fort Wayne, Chicago and Toledo, in addition to continued negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Little Rock and Memphis. We are actively proposing generous wage increases over the life of the various contracts we are negotiating, and these increases are included in our financial model and our guidance for 2022.  \n We are also communicating to local unions that coming to the table with unrealistic proposals, proposals that do not balance associate investments with keeping groceries affordable for our customers is untenable and undermines our shared goal of growing the company to create more jobs and advancement opportunities for more associates.  \n In closing, let me now provide additional color on the 2022 guidance that we released this morning. While we recognize there remain a number of uncertainties in the economic and geopolitical outlook, we believe the strength of Kroger's go-to-market strategy and our ability to manage multiple levers within our financial model will allow us to continue to build momentum within our business in 2022. We have shared previously that we expect to emerge from the pandemic stronger, and our guidance for 2022 creates a new baseline for FIFO net operating profit that is some $900 million higher than the midpoint of our TSR model would have projected when we announced it in 2019.  \n Our plans contemplate meaningful investments in associate hourly rates as well as investments in delivering greater value for our customers and enhancing our digital capabilities. We expect these investments and the impact of cycling COVID-19 vaccine revenue will be fully offset by tailwinds in our model and allow us to grow adjusted net earnings per diluted share to between $3.75 and $3.85.  \n The tailwinds in our 2022 plan includes sales leverage from growing identical sales without fuel between 2% and 3%. We also expect to deliver cost savings of $1 billion, incremental alternative profit growth largely in line with 2021 and underlying improvement in Kroger Health profitability, excluding vaccine income. Fuel profitability is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year as gallon growth is offset by slightly lower fuel margins.  \n In terms of quarterly cadence for identical sales of our fuel and EPS growth, we expect identical sales without fuel in quarter 1 and quarter 2 will be above the midpoint of our 2% to 3% range as we expect heightened inflation will continue in the first half of the year. We would expect our second half identical sales without fuel to be below the midpoint of our range as we expect the inflation to moderate later in the year as we cycle higher inflation from the second half of 2021. Regarding adjusted EPS, we would expect quarter 1 to be above the annual growth rate range of 2% to 5%, quarter 2 to be below the range and the second half of the year to be within the range.  \n Turning briefly to our capital priorities. We will continue to be disciplined with capital allocation. As you heard this morning, we are increasing capital investments to $3.8 billion to $4 billion in 2022. This reflects some catch-up from the last 2 years, where spend was below original guidance due to COVID-related constraints as well as an acceleration of our strategic initiatives that will drive longer-term earnings growth. At the same time, we expect to generate free cash flow of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. And consistent with our TSR model, we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders as evidenced by the acceleration in share buybacks over the last 6 months.  \n And finally, we are looking forward to spending more time with you at our business update tomorrow when you will hear from key members of our leadership team about our strategic priorities and our path to deliver total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time. With that, I'll turn it back to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Kroger is operating from a position of strength, and we have a variety of levers and growth opportunities to continue to build on this strength. As we reflect on 2021, we are incredibly proud of our ability to navigate both a rapidly changing operating environment and evolving customer behaviors.  \n We are obviously in an inflationary environment. Our teams are managing it well. And as Gary talked about, we are doing everything we can to keep prices low for customers, including our award-winning customer rewards program, which includes fuel rewards, our amazing and high-quality Our Brands products and personalized offers and savings for each customer individualized.  \n As we look to 2022, we are confident in our ability to continue to differentiate ourselves, serve our customers in new and exciting ways and continue to change the definition of what it means to be a grocery retailer while never losing sight of what's most important to our customers. And when we do this, we have a clear path to delivering on our commitment of 8% to 11% total shareholder returns over time for our shareholders.  \n Now we look forward to your questions. As Rob shared at the top of the call, we would like to focus all questions on our quarter 4 and full year 2021 results as well as 2022 guidance. We look forward to sharing additional details about our long-term strategy tomorrow at our 2022 Business Update. So with that, we'll turn it over for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: Congrats on a really strong quarter. So I guess just starting out, just on the gross margin line, pretty significant improvement in gross margins on a 1- and 2-year basis. What are the key changes? Maybe some more color in terms of what drove that improvement versus what we saw in Q2 and Q3. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rupesh. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks and Rodney covered in a moment ago, really proud of the team in the way that we managed the business in Q4 and some of the changes that were happening. From I think what the team did, we're obviously laser-focused on how can we continue to be effective in managing the sourcing approach to how we are leveraging the relationships with our suppliers and using our data.  \n We've been very effective in using our personalization and promotional activities to really sort of target the offers to the customer to make sure that they're seeing the value but that we're also then able to manage those cost increases effectively in the business. \n I think mix is also another important trend that the team is really focused on is how do we ensure that we're upselling customers to better quality products and premiumized products and whether it's adding the cedar plank to the salmon or the seasoning to the shrimp. And some of those opportunities are really important in how the merchandising team are really focused on recognizing some consumer trends in how many of our customers are moving to more meal solutions as well as continuing to look value -- look for value.  \n So overall, we feel really good around the way the team managed our gross margin during the quarter. As we think about going forward into 2022, we continue to focus on, of course, the same elements and continue to manage those pieces tightly while also wanting to make sure we're continuing to deliver value for our customers. And I think to us, really, we look at it more of how do we manage the model overall across gross margin, OG&A and pulling the different levers.  \n And certainly, I think we look at 2022 and think that we'll continue to invest in the customer. We'll continue to manage those different levers. I would suspect that we'll see continued investment in gross margin in 2022 and continued operating leverage in OG&A. But I think the fourth quarter is a good example of where we wouldn't expect to see some of the major volatility or the gap in gross margin and OG&A that we saw across the whole year, for example, in 2021. \nW. McMullen: Yes. Just a couple of additional things. During COVID, as we've mentioned several times, people have learned how to cook again. And what they're finding is that they can have restaurant-quality food that they prepare at home. And in numerous categories like the specialty cheese that I mentioned, but there's numerous categories where customers have traded up to higher-quality product. And everything that we're seeing, they continue with that. And the other thing, I think, that's always important to remind all of us is that our fresh departments grew faster than the center store departments. And our fresh departments have a higher gross rate as well versus the center store. So just a couple of additional things. Thanks, Rupesh. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one follow-up. So with a lot of inflation out there in the marketplace, how do your price gaps look today versus maybe where they were a few quarters ago? \nW. McMullen: If you look at overall, it's pretty close to the cost increases we've incurred. If you look at -- in a couple of departments strategically, it's not -- the retail price hasn't increased as much as cost, and we've been able to balance all of those pieces. But we really are using our data to make sure that we understand the elasticity of everything. \n We are starting to see customers engaging in coupons a little bit more aggressive than before and doing other things in terms of starting to move to our brands where they don't have to compromise on quality and they can save money as well. So we are starting to see the beginning of some behavior changes as well, but really early. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Maybe the only thing to add, Rodney. Certainly, as you know, Rupesh, the customer, as we look at our data, defines value in multiple ways. So part of it is the everyday price, part of it is the promotions. It includes our fuel rewards and all the personalization that we offer. And I would say, if we look at our position as we end the year from where we started, we feel very good about the way in which we've been able to deliver value for the customer. And when we look at our price position, we feel we've been able to maintain a very strong position with the customer in terms of how they would perceive the value of the Kroger basket and the value that Kroger's delivering. \nOperator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: A nice quarter and guide. My question is the comp guide is solid for next year. And we're a little surprised at how good the EBIT flow-through or the margin still looks, given all the cost pressures on the wage side. You mentioned some things on the gross margin. You mentioned tailwinds, but I wanted to put it to you holistically and hear your reaction to this question. \nW. McMullen: Yes. I'll start and let Gary get into some more of the details. I think one of the things that's -- to me, your question is great. But the thing that I think is really important to remember is the things that we continue to do to take costs out of our system all across everything. And we would expect to be able to take another $1 billion of cost out. And as you know, last year, we took over $1 billion out and that was the fourth consecutive year. \n So through process change and really, it's becoming a capability that the organization has, that's really critical to be able to afford to do some of the things that we're doing. The other thing is alternative profit and some of the other things related to that continues to change the fundamental business model in a positive way, that inflation doesn't affect the same way and the profitability of that part of the business is significantly higher than the traditional grocery store would be as well. Gary, any additional stuff? \nGary Millerchip: Well, I think you summarized it well, Rodney. I think, Simeon, we feel about it as you look at our 2021 results and then you think about our guidance '22, it really demonstrates the strength in that, the overall diversity of our model now and the different levers that we're able to pull to make sure that we're investing in our associates, investing in our customers and still able to deliver a strong return for our shareholders. \n And we would agree with you that 2022 is a year where we do expect to make significant investments, whether it's around continuing to support the customer and drive growth in our business, investing in our associates, investing in digital. And of course, we will be cycling some COVID vaccine revenue that will be lower in 2022 than '21. But Rodney mentioned the cost savings and alternative profit benefits that we see within the model. We do continue to expect, obviously, to generate sales leverage in our model as well. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, health and wellness will certainly have some headwinds from COVID vaccines, but we believe there's continued opportunity to improve the underlying profitability in health and wellness as well in 2022. \nSimeon Gutman: And maybe related, the value-conscious customer, are you seeing any signs of trade down? Are you seeing customers trade out? Are you seeing any decisions in the store that lead you to see that the customer is feeling a little more pinched? \nW. McMullen: Yes. What the customers are telling us is that they're changing their spend behavior outside of food more than food, which obviously makes sense. They also have found that eating at home is a lot more affordable than going out to restaurants. They're able to stretch their budget this way -- that way as well.\n And as I mentioned a second ago, we are seeing people starting to engage in coupons and some of those things a little more than before. But nothing substantial so far, and we really feel good about the way we're positioned with the customer. And if you look at our connection to that customer segment, it actually improved in the fourth quarter versus prior year. And what customers are finding is our fresh departments are a huge strength, and then they're able to get personalized rewards and engage with us on promotional items and things like that. \nOperator: The next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with, if you look at the $1 billion of cost takeout, right, how does that roughly break out between COGS and O&A? And how has that changed over the last 3 or 4 years? Has it shifted more to O&A or it stayed relatively consistent? \nW. McMullen: Yes. The -- if you look at overall, it would be more cost-driven. Now goods not for resale, do you put it in cost or do you put in COGS because you can argue either one. But it's more driven by process change and eliminating work. Obviously, sourcing is an important component of it. Goods not for resale is incredibly important as well. If you look at the mix, the mix has been pretty consistent over the last 4 years. If you look at our expectations for 2022, Gary, it would be pretty similar to 2021. I mean, it might be 5% difference but not much, right? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. No, I think the only thing, John, that's really accelerated over the last couple of years, I completely agree with Rodney around the sourcing benefits and the taking cost out of the operation. The one thing that, as you know, we've talked about is we invested in digital to ensure that we're winning the customer to build that $10 billion business that we talked about. And we did that sometimes, recognizing that there'll be some inefficiency in our model. \n And so I think one of the areas that we've been able to accelerate is taking cost out of the digital sort of cost to serve a customer, if you like, as we can leverage more efficiency in that scale. And that's become a tailwind this year and will be -- or was last year and will be in 2022 as part of the cost structure. That's probably the one area that's maybe changed a little bit over the last couple of years, but I completely agree with Rodney. On the balance, it's pretty consistent. \nW. McMullen: John, Gary's last point to me is incredibly important. And everybody on the call, you've all heard us talk about job 1 is don't lose the customer as they switch to being a combination of digital and in-store. And then over time, we'll figure out a way to make that customer just as profitable as a customer that traditionally shopped in the store. So I think Gary's last point is really important. \nJohn Heinbockel: And then maybe talk about the how fuel rewards performs in an environment where price per gallon may be approaching $4, right? How it performs? And then do you do anything differently? I don't think the plan -- the program construct would change. But does it -- or does your marketing change? Because you would think in this environment, fuel rewards is way more important than it was a year or 2 ago? \nW. McMullen: Your belief and comment is correct. What we find is customers find it very helpful and as fuel prices go up, they engage in the fuel rewards more. Obviously, we continue to leverage fuel rewards in ways that make sense for different customer segments because different segments engage differently in fuel rewards. Obviously, we would prefer for fuel not to be at $3 or $4 a gallon, but we're going to do everything we can to help the customer stretch their budget as much as we can. \nOperator: The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. \nSpencer Hanus: This is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. I just want to follow up on the FIFO adjusted gross margins for a minute. Did you see any change in the competitive environment that allowed you to pass through more costs? We know that Walmart's U.S. gross margins were up 54 basis points last quarter. So curious if that provided an opening for you guys. And then should we look at the 4Q performance as a good run rate for 2022? \nW. McMullen: Yes. The first part of that, I wouldn't say that we saw it really change any differently. Obviously, Walmart is one competitor but there's numerous competitors out there. And what we're trying to do is to make sure that we're balancing inflation and helping the customers stretch their budget as much as we can. And we've continued to invest in pricing in areas that matter most to customers. So we really are -- we wouldn't consider it easier or harder. It's just part of the overall managing the business. In terms of looking forward, Gary, I'll let you answer that part. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Spencer, as you know, we don't tend to give detailed guidance on the puts and takes in gross margin rate and OG&A rate because we much more view it as how do we manage the business as a whole to drive sustainable earnings growth. I would say that I mentioned it in one of the earlier responses, that we would expect to continue to invest in the customer in 2022. And we'd also actually expect to see some accelerated advertising costs too because we're going to obviously continue to grow the business and we'll talk about it tomorrow, some of the digital growth opportunities that we're focused on as well. \n So I think as we look at the total year, we still expect some investment in gross margin in 2022, but we'd also continue to expect to see significant OG&A leverage as well in many areas through the cost savings that Rodney mentioned. And certainly, we wouldn't expect the gap between those 2 to be anywhere near as wide as it was when you look at the full year results in 2021. So I wouldn't take the fourth quarter as the sort of the number to use, but I would certainly expect us to be tightly managing those. And we do believe, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, all the work the team has done around sourcing, connecting with customers, driving our strategy to deliver value for customers gives us confidence in the overall guidance that we shared for next year. \nSpencer Hanus: Got it, that's helpful. And then fuel profitability is up significantly versus 2019 despite the rising prices, which is typically a headwind to that -- to profitability. So I understand that you expect profitability to be down this year a little bit. But how sustainable do you think it is, this step-up versus '19? And then could you just remind us how much operating profit the fuel business contributed in 4Q just so we can better back into how the core performed? \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Yes, it's a great question on fuel. As you know, we talk about this each year, and we used to base our assumptions on a sort of a 3- to 5-year trend. And if you look at the last 3 to 5 years, really, fuel profitability has continued to improve pretty consistently as we look at the trends in our business and how our fuel reward program is connecting and what a great job our team has done in managing fuel margins. I do think there's a little bit of left pocket, right pocket in some of that, of course, as well because we spend a tremendous amount of money in rewarding customers, giving up to over $1 a gallon off for discount for customers that are highly engaged in the program. \n So I think it's important to remember that there are 2 dimensions to it, and we recognize that in our gross margin on the supermarket business and don't flow through on the fuel side because the redemption of those points is tied to when you spend at Kroger in the store online, not tied to specifically the fuel usage. So that's an important factor to remember. \n We believe that the fuel business has sustained improvement in profitability, so we're less focused on the historical trends now because we believe the industry has changed structurally. And we'd expect that to be maintained for us and also because of the strength in our value proposition with the customer. We don't specifically call out details on fuel and total profitability. I would say that actually, broadly speaking, the tailwind on fuel in the fourth quarter largely align with the headwind in LIFO, so the 2 of those pretty much offset each other during the quarter. \nW. McMullen: One other thing on fuel that our team -- 2 or 3 years ago, we restructured our procurement team in fuel, and they've also made progress relative to the market on cost of goods, which has been helpful for that business as well. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: How much did inflation contribute to IDs in 4Q? And how much do you expect inflation to contribute to IDs in a year ahead? And as part of that, it does look like you're expecting IDs to still be positive in the second half of the year. Does that mean you expect this total number of new occasions in the second half of the year, number of new occasions at home, to remain positive? \nW. McMullen: If you look at -- as Gary mentioned, we would expect inflation in the second half of the year to moderate just because it's cycling the inflation from the second half of this year -- or last year, I guess, now. Overall, as you know, we operate successfully in every operating environment, whether it's inflationary or deflationary. And we're doing everything we can to minimize the impact on our customers. \n If you look at overall, we would expect the business to continue to grow. And part of that is really the seamless ecosystem. Altogether, what we're finding is we get a bigger part of their overall household spend. We also -- if you look at total households, we had good numbers on total households for the fourth quarter versus 2020 and 2019. And we would -- and what we find is that once we get a new customer, we're able to move them up the loyalty ladder over time because of the experience they get from our associates on the customer experience, the seamless ecosystem, fresh and good value, plus we're able to start personalized rewards for them. So we would expect to be able to move those new customers up the loyalty ladder, which would help -- be helpful in identicals as well. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? \nGary Millerchip: No, I think you covered it well. \nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is, Rodney, the percentage of gross units that are on promotion is still about 500 basis points below where it was prior to the pandemic. And prior to the pandemic, that metric for the industry has been very consistent over time. So why is it that the industry is just going to be less promotional moving forward than it has been in the past? \nW. McMullen: Yes. Relative to the industry, I wouldn't have as much detail on that. If you look at our revenue, our sales on promotion, it's pretty much very similar today as it was before the pandemic. It's really -- it's something we track every week or whatever. During the pandemic, there were promotions we didn't do just because there were some items you couldn't get product. And obviously, you don't want to promote an item where you don't have enough inventory to support the product. In some cases, that's still the case. But overall, our promotional activity is pretty similar to what it was before the pandemic. \nGary Millerchip: I think, Michael, just to add that I think that Rodney's comments are really what causes us to believe that when we talk to our customers and look at our data, we feel we're in a very good position relative to the value that customers receiving from Kroger in this environment and our ability to continue to deliver value for our customers and maintain a strong perception as customers continue to evolve into 2022 and beyond. \nW. McMullen: And one of the things that I think it's important to remember, we would track internally on sales on promotion, not items on promotion. So it's volume weighted as well, I think, is an important point too. \nOperator: The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: I wanted to ask you about labor because you brought it up on the call. But can you just provide a little bit more color on sort of like what's going on, on the labor front right now? I mean, you have a very strong history of being fair, right? Like I think if we take an objective view here, that seems to be the case. But as we saw with Denver, these renewals now can be costly and there are other big contracts coming up. I guess how has the dialogue been? It does seem like you're poised to see some acceleration of inflation. I wonder if you agree with that and if you can quantify. And then what are you doing to offset that pressure, things like automation, in addition to some of the cost save stuff? \nW. McMullen: Yes. As you know, when we embarked upon Restock Kroger several years ago, we made the commitment that we would accelerate our associate wages. And as Gary mentioned, now we -- incrementally, it's about $1.2 billion per year that we are investing in supporting our associates. We think supporting our associates is incredibly important. And what we're always trying to do is to make sure that we have solid wages, strong wages and industry-leading benefits, which we do have and making sure that we're keeping food affordable for customers. \n And it's a balance that we're always trying to do. Obviously, we work with the unions, but it's -- we want to make sure that our business is sustainable for the long term and we're creating jobs long term and we're creating career opportunities. And if you look at our store directory, 70% started out as an hourly associate. If you look at department heads, almost all started out as hourly part-time associates, and those are things that are incredibly important. \n So it's obviously a balance. We've strategically, several years ago, decided to invest more in wages because we thought it was important to do. And what we find is, over time, it also reduces turnover. And when you have turnover reduction, obviously, the productivity of somebody that's been working for us for a couple of years is higher than a new hire. \n It really gets back to the cost saves that Gary and I both talked about. Literally, you're looking for every single thing where you can stock something in a different way because if you save a second across our company, it's about $14 million. So it's -- you're looking for every single thing that you can do anywhere in the store, anywhere in a plant or a warehouse to be able to eliminate waste. And we believe that we have a core competency now on how to do that. And those are things that are allowing us to make the investments in our associate wages. I think, Gary, over the last, what, 4 years, our average hourly rate is up 22%. And we've been able to obviously do that at the same time on significantly lowering our OG&A expense. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Maybe just a couple of things to add, Rodney. When Rodney talked about the last 4 years and the investment we've made, I wouldn't think of that as being the end of the journey when we announced our TSR model. We were actually fully expecting, as we look out towards 2025, that we will continue to invest in our associates and our model when we announced the TSR model of 8% to 11% growth. We actually did expect that we would continue to invest not just over '18, '19 and '20 but continue to invest '21 through 2025. \n So it's always been something that we contemplated in our model. We kind of felt that this was something that would come. And now admittedly, the last 12 months obviously have changed the landscape a little bit. So I would say we've pulled forward some of that thinking. And we would fully expect within our guidance that we've shared, 2022 will be a higher number in wage investments than 2021 was. So we are fully contemplating that with the guidance that we shared, and we expect that growth in wage to continue. And again, it was fully part of our TSR model. \n We'll talk a little bit about tomorrow. But to Rodney's point, one of the reasons that we're increasing our capital investments in 2022 beyond the sort of catch-up of some of the things that were slowed down by COVID is we are going to be investing more in technology. We still feel like as proud as we are of the $1 billion-plus we've saved for the last 4 years, we still think there's a lot of opportunity to use technology even more effectively to take more cost out of the business. And it's one of the reasons that we're accelerating capital because we believe it will help support -- continue to increase efficiency over the next few years as we continue to invest in average hourly rates. And Mary Ellen Adcock will share a little bit more color on that when we see you tomorrow as well. \nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. \nMichael Montani: The first question I had was just around the ID sales that you reported. I was wondering if you could discuss what kind of cost increases you all were seeing in terms of a percentage and how much you were able to pass through. And then also what your outlook would be for that same basis for 2022? \nW. McMullen: If you look within the quarter, it was pretty consistent. Obviously, you'll have -- in the fourth quarter especially, you'll have some weather that drives it. If you look at so far this quarter, it would look pretty similar to last -- to the fourth quarter on IDs. Overall, on cost increases, for the most part, they were passed through but not every area within the department. So it's really balancing all of the different pieces in terms of cost increases and trying to minimize the impact on the customer. \nMichael Montani: And then I guess just the outlook for '22, like if we look at the U.S. FDA, they're calling for, I think, 2.5% to 3.5% full year inflation for this year. Is that a good benchmark for us to use without any better information, would you say? \nW. McMullen: Well, yes, we would be using the same data source. But we would expect within the year, it would be meaningfully higher in the first half versus the second half. But somebody on Gary's team probably have gotten a PhD on the amount of time that he's spent on trying to estimate inflation. And at the end of the day, you basically end up in that spot.\n We would expect SNAP, just a pure number of SNAP households, to be a headwind. But what we find on SNAP is some people switch to buying items with credit card, cash and other things as well. And the other piece of our guidance would reflect in our health and wellness business. There's some third-party plans that weren't profitable that we also are going to move away from or have moved away from that's impacted our number on our guidance as well. \nGary Millerchip: The only other thing I would add that -- Rodney shared this earlier in the Q&A, but we are seeing customers tell us that as inflation is certainly higher in food, which obviously we're all focused on, but inflation is obviously higher pretty much everywhere in the economy right now. And actually, whereas maybe a few months ago, customers were telling us they were eating more food at home because of concerns around COVID, some of that shifted more to -- while food at home inflation is higher, actually relative to other inflation and how I need to manage my budget, food at home is more attractive in terms of helping me be able to manage my budget and manage my dollars. \n So there's a lot of -- I think a lot of factors that are impacting that outlook that we're obviously using the best information we can to forecast and feel good about the guidance that we've shared and our ability to manage different levers if things change. But we recognize our crystal ball isn't perfect and we'll just continue to be dynamic in the way we manage it. \nMichael Montani: Great. And just the follow-up question in terms of expense outlook was in light of the $1 billion-plus of gross cost-out, is there a certain kind of ID sales level that you would need probably to leverage that you could discuss? And how much vaccine contribution did you have in '21 that needs to cycle now in '22? \nW. McMullen: As Gary mentioned on the vaccines, that is something we factored into the guidance overall and it's just part of the total puzzle. We would also expect some of that to be offset because we're able to provide more of the regular vaccines that we always have. And some of that focus that went on vaccines, we'll be able to acquire additional customers to offset some of that. So all of that is factored into the guidance we gave. On the identical sales, right now, as long as we can continue to get the cost out, we're able to leverage a pretty modest amounts of identical in terms of being able to leverage. \nGary Millerchip: Yes, there's lots of puts and takes, as you heard us mention in our 2022 guidance overall, and we would expect there to be cost increases, obviously, from our investment in average hourly wage. And we continue to invest in the customer experience. But overall, factoring in all the elements of our model, we would expect to generate leverage and our OG&A rate would improve in 2022 over 2021 based on all the different pieces coming together in our model. So within 2022, specifically with that 2% to 3% IDs, we would expect to be able to improve the OG&A rate in the year. \nOperator: This will be our last question, and it comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Goldman: I'll make it quick. Just to build on Ed's question. Can you elaborate a bit, if possible, on how we should think about the risk of labor this year? I was struck a little bit by how much time Gary spent on the subject and a little bit of the tone. It kind of felt like a warning to investors, frankly. So if there's any data you can provide on what percentage of your workers are up for renegotiation this year or whatever metric is appropriate, that would be great. \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at labor overall, it's something that we're proud. We're one of the largest union employers in the United States. And we're focused on providing additional -- we go in with the ability and assumption that we're going to continue to invest in our associates. And we have industry-leading benefits and we support their ability to come for a job and make it a career by feeding your future, providing tuition reimbursement and other things to help people continue to achieve a career. \n So we're always balancing all of the pieces. So our associates are critical to our future success. We invest in our associates and I want to make sure that we have a strong, sustainable business so that they're able to support their families as well. And there's nothing more inspiring than when you're in a store and somebody talks about -- the other day, I was at Ralph's and somebody was talking about how they were able to send 4 of their kids to college and 1 was a doctor and 1 was an attorney. And those are the kind of things that is incredibly inspiring to hear our associates talk about. \nGary Millerchip: And Ken, I think just one thing to add. We are obviously trying to listen to feedback carefully, and we've got a sense that there was a desire to hear more about our overall strategy. As we shared in the prepared comments, we feel really good about the investments we have made and are continuing to make in our associates. And we have a team that's very experienced in managing those relationships. But we wanted to make sure, as we had some feedback that you'd like more color, that we try and listen to investor feedback and wanted to make sure we addressed that in the prepared remarks. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Ken. Thank you all for attending today's call. We look forward to engaging with all of you again tomorrow at our business update in Florida. As I always do, I would like to conclude our call by taking a moment to address our associates who many listen in. I'm extremely proud of the things we have accomplished this year and we celebrated many significant milestones. Thank you on behalf of all our team for making Kroger better every day. I'm so proud of you. \n As America's grocer, Kroger is taking action to show our support and solidarity with Ukraine. Today, we are sending emergency food assistance to support refugees through a grant from the Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation to the UN World Food Program Ukraine Emergency Fund. We will match all gifts made by our associates and customers up to $250,000. That concludes our earnings -- fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you. And as I said before, we look forward to seeing many of you tomorrow. Take care. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital propelled Kroger to record performance in 2021 on top of record results in 2020. We are incredibly proud of our associates who continued to deliver for our customers through the pandemic. During 2021, our team delivered for all stakeholders by, first of all, achieving positive year-over-year identicals without fuel against very strong identicals last year and a 2-year stack of 14.3%.  \n Also by connecting with customers through expanding our seamless ecosystem and remarkable, consistent delivery of full fresh and friendly customer experience for everyone, plus investing more than ever before in our associates to raise our average hourly rate to $17 and our average hourly rate to over $22 when you include [ compensation ] and benefits as well. We balance all of these investments by achieving cost savings of greater than $1 billion for the fourth consecutive year, and alternative profits contributed an incremental $150 million of operating profit as well. \n As we look to 2022, we expect the momentum in our business to continue, and we have confidence in our ability to navigate a rapidly changing operating environment. We are leveraging technology, innovation and our competitive moats to build lasting competitive advantages. Our balanced model is allowing us to deliver for shareholders, invest in our associates, continue to provide fresh, affordable food for our customers and support for our communities.  \n We remain confident in our growth model and our ability to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. Kroger is leading with fresh. Our fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales, excluding fuel, during the fourth quarter. Kroger remains the #1 retailer in many exciting areas such as specialty cheese, sushi and floral. As the world's largest florist, we sold over 76 million floral stems for Valentine's Day alone. And the smiles that came along with that for our customers and associates were free.  \n We advanced our fresh strategy and strengthened our fresh offerings in 2021 by launching our Go Fresh & Local Supplier Accelerator, supporting our commitment to small businesses. As a result of the launch, we have brought a number of new products to customers, and the initial results have exceeded our expectations. We are still early in the program, and we will continue to partner with small businesses to expand our pipeline of new products. We also remain a leader in innovation through exciting partnerships with companies like Kitchen United and Kipster. We've completed the initial test phase of our End-to-End Fresh initiatives focused on bringing more days of freshness to our customers and are confident in its scalability and with plans to expand to targeted stores across the country.  \n Our brands continue to resonate strongly with customers and maintains a culture of innovation, launching over 660 new items during the year. More than half of those new items were within our Simple Truth and Private Selection portfolios. We accelerated Home Chef's incredible milestone of becoming a billion-dollar brand, our fourth greater-than-$1 billion brand, which is pretty special. As a reminder for everyone, we merged with Home Chef in 2018. At the time, we knew our customers were looking for ways to make meal time easier without compromising on taste or freshness.  \n While Home Chef originated as a pure-play e-commerce offering, we saw immense potential to integrate and leverage it across our seamless ecosystem, scaling it within our stores and continuing to grow online. The success of this integration demonstrates our ability to integrate and scale solutions that provide value to our customers and grow our competitive moats.  \n Kroger is focused on delivering a seamless experience that requires 0 compromise by customers, and I think that's a really important point, 0 compromise required by customers. And what that means is the freshest products at competitive prices and flexible lead times. Yael will go into a lot more detail tomorrow on what 0 compromise means for our customers at our business update.  \n The strength in our top line sales in 2021 demonstrates our ability to meet our customers no matter how they choose to engage with us, whether it's in-store or online. At the same time, we are actively encouraging customers to engage with us on our digital platforms, even when shopping in store. That's because when a customer engages with us digitally, they spend more with Kroger within all modalities.  \n We continue to attract new customers to our digital platforms. During the quarter, we saw new seamless pickup and delivery to household acquisitions increased 25% compared to the third quarter. We remain committed to doubling digital sales and profitability by 2023, which was announced in 2021. We look forward to sharing our glide path to this goal with you tomorrow. We do not expect digital growth will be linear, especially as we cycle the sales spike in 2020 and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again.  \n We are incredibly proud of the new digital modalities we launched during 2021, including Kroger Delivery Now, our Boost membership program and the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers, all of which we expect to contribute meaningfully to our long-term goals. Yesterday, we announced a new customer fulfillment center for the Cleveland region, following on heels of our announcement of a cross-dock spoke facility that will serve Oklahoma City. And just a few weeks ago, we opened our third customer fulfillment center in Forest Park, Georgia and are leveraging learnings from Monroe and Groveland to drive efficiencies and scale in the new facility. Customers are loving this new offering, and we continue to be pleased with the initial rollout of our facilities in Groveland and Monroe, and we look forward to sharing additional insights tomorrow.  \n Now turning to the supply chain. Our teams across our stores, warehouses, plants and offices have been incredible in working together to supply fresh food and necessities for our customers while addressing the rapidly changing environment. During the quarter, industry challenges continued within the supply chain, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenges. Within our supply chain, we continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet. We are also partnering with our suppliers to improve product availability using the strength of our data science teams to provide insights that shorten lead times and optimize inventory flow across the extended supply chain.  \n We continue to focus on expanding our transportation contracts and attracting carriers from outside our industry, which has kept product flowing predictably across our network. The teams are doing a great job managing the increased costs, and the trends within our costs are improving sequentially. We are using our data and supplier data plus leveraging technology to support future growth. We expect the supply chain to continue to improve throughout the year as a result of our actions.  \n When I visit our stores, I often hear from our associates that what they love most about their job is that they can positively impact the lives of our customers, communities and each other every day. And it's also what I love about our business too. And it's what makes our purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit, so vital for our people. One way we live our purpose is through progress toward our ESG goals and our commitments. As part of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan, last year, Kroger donated 499 million meals, that's right, 499 million meals, to feed hungry families across America. And we continue to make progress toward our goal of 0 waste.  \n As part of our commitments to helping people live healthier lives, we've administrated almost 11 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine through Kroger Health. For our more than 450,000 associates, we strive to create a culture of opportunity, and we take seriously our role as a leading employer in the United States. Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first jobs, new beginnings and lifelong careers.  \n As we continue to operate in a challenging labor market, we are dedicated to attracting and retaining the right talent across the organization to be able to continue delivering for our customers. We are investing more than ever before in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness as well as the continued investment in wages that I mentioned earlier. This is enabling us to navigate current labor conditions while continuing to provide America with the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem.  \n We are cultivating an environment where all associates are able to thrive. For the fourth year in a row, Kroger earned top score in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index, the nation's benchmark in measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Last year alone, we provided more than $5 million to support associates through unexpected hardships through our Helping Hands Fund. This includes providing critical funds for disaster relief for nearly 1,300 associates.  \n 2021 was an incredible year for Kroger, and we are committed to continued growth. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our relentless focus on learning and improving every day. I believe this has been a key on navigating our business successfully in every operating environment. We remain customer-obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. And now I'd like to turn it over to Gary. Gary? Thanks, Gary. Kroger is operating from a position of strength, and we have a variety of levers and growth opportunities to continue to build on this strength. As we reflect on 2021, we are incredibly proud of our ability to navigate both a rapidly changing operating environment and evolving customer behaviors.  \n We are obviously in an inflationary environment. Our teams are managing it well. And as Gary talked about, we are doing everything we can to keep prices low for customers, including our award-winning customer rewards program, which includes fuel rewards, our amazing and high-quality Our Brands products and personalized offers and savings for each customer individualized.  \n As we look to 2022, we are confident in our ability to continue to differentiate ourselves, serve our customers in new and exciting ways and continue to change the definition of what it means to be a grocery retailer while never losing sight of what's most important to our customers. And when we do this, we have a clear path to delivering on our commitment of 8% to 11% total shareholder returns over time for our shareholders.  \n Now we look forward to your questions. As Rob shared at the top of the call, we would like to focus all questions on our quarter 4 and full year 2021 results as well as 2022 guidance. We look forward to sharing additional details about our long-term strategy tomorrow at our 2022 Business Update. So with that, we'll turn it over for questions. Yes. Just a couple of additional things. During COVID, as we've mentioned several times, people have learned how to cook again. And what they're finding is that they can have restaurant-quality food that they prepare at home. And in numerous categories like the specialty cheese that I mentioned, but there's numerous categories where customers have traded up to higher-quality product. And everything that we're seeing, they continue with that. And the other thing, I think, that's always important to remind all of us is that our fresh departments grew faster than the center store departments. And our fresh departments have a higher gross rate as well versus the center store. So just a couple of additional things. Thanks, Rupesh. If you look at overall, it's pretty close to the cost increases we've incurred. If you look at -- in a couple of departments strategically, it's not -- the retail price hasn't increased as much as cost, and we've been able to balance all of those pieces. But we really are using our data to make sure that we understand the elasticity of everything. \n We are starting to see customers engaging in coupons a little bit more aggressive than before and doing other things in terms of starting to move to our brands where they don't have to compromise on quality and they can save money as well. So we are starting to see the beginning of some behavior changes as well, but really early. Yes. I'll start and let Gary get into some more of the details. I think one of the things that's -- to me, your question is great. But the thing that I think is really important to remember is the things that we continue to do to take costs out of our system all across everything. And we would expect to be able to take another $1 billion of cost out. And as you know, last year, we took over $1 billion out and that was the fourth consecutive year. \n So through process change and really, it's becoming a capability that the organization has, that's really critical to be able to afford to do some of the things that we're doing. The other thing is alternative profit and some of the other things related to that continues to change the fundamental business model in a positive way, that inflation doesn't affect the same way and the profitability of that part of the business is significantly higher than the traditional grocery store would be as well. Gary, any additional stuff? Yes. What the customers are telling us is that they're changing their spend behavior outside of food more than food, which obviously makes sense. They also have found that eating at home is a lot more affordable than going out to restaurants. They're able to stretch their budget this way -- that way as well.\n And as I mentioned a second ago, we are seeing people starting to engage in coupons and some of those things a little more than before. But nothing substantial so far, and we really feel good about the way we're positioned with the customer. And if you look at our connection to that customer segment, it actually improved in the fourth quarter versus prior year. And what customers are finding is our fresh departments are a huge strength, and then they're able to get personalized rewards and engage with us on promotional items and things like that. Yes. The -- if you look at overall, it would be more cost-driven. Now goods not for resale, do you put it in cost or do you put in COGS because you can argue either one. But it's more driven by process change and eliminating work. Obviously, sourcing is an important component of it. Goods not for resale is incredibly important as well. If you look at the mix, the mix has been pretty consistent over the last 4 years. If you look at our expectations for 2022, Gary, it would be pretty similar to 2021. I mean, it might be 5% difference but not much, right? John, Gary's last point to me is incredibly important. And everybody on the call, you've all heard us talk about job 1 is don't lose the customer as they switch to being a combination of digital and in-store. And then over time, we'll figure out a way to make that customer just as profitable as a customer that traditionally shopped in the store. So I think Gary's last point is really important. Your belief and comment is correct. What we find is customers find it very helpful and as fuel prices go up, they engage in the fuel rewards more. Obviously, we continue to leverage fuel rewards in ways that make sense for different customer segments because different segments engage differently in fuel rewards. Obviously, we would prefer for fuel not to be at $3 or $4 a gallon, but we're going to do everything we can to help the customer stretch their budget as much as we can. Yes. The first part of that, I wouldn't say that we saw it really change any differently. Obviously, Walmart is one competitor but there's numerous competitors out there. And what we're trying to do is to make sure that we're balancing inflation and helping the customers stretch their budget as much as we can. And we've continued to invest in pricing in areas that matter most to customers. So we really are -- we wouldn't consider it easier or harder. It's just part of the overall managing the business. In terms of looking forward, Gary, I'll let you answer that part. One other thing on fuel that our team -- 2 or 3 years ago, we restructured our procurement team in fuel, and they've also made progress relative to the market on cost of goods, which has been helpful for that business as well. If you look at -- as Gary mentioned, we would expect inflation in the second half of the year to moderate just because it's cycling the inflation from the second half of this year -- or last year, I guess, now. Overall, as you know, we operate successfully in every operating environment, whether it's inflationary or deflationary. And we're doing everything we can to minimize the impact on our customers. \n If you look at overall, we would expect the business to continue to grow. And part of that is really the seamless ecosystem. Altogether, what we're finding is we get a bigger part of their overall household spend. We also -- if you look at total households, we had good numbers on total households for the fourth quarter versus 2020 and 2019. And we would -- and what we find is that once we get a new customer, we're able to move them up the loyalty ladder over time because of the experience they get from our associates on the customer experience, the seamless ecosystem, fresh and good value, plus we're able to start personalized rewards for them. So we would expect to be able to move those new customers up the loyalty ladder, which would help -- be helpful in identicals as well. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? Yes. Relative to the industry, I wouldn't have as much detail on that. If you look at our revenue, our sales on promotion, it's pretty much very similar today as it was before the pandemic. It's really -- it's something we track every week or whatever. During the pandemic, there were promotions we didn't do just because there were some items you couldn't get product. And obviously, you don't want to promote an item where you don't have enough inventory to support the product. In some cases, that's still the case. But overall, our promotional activity is pretty similar to what it was before the pandemic. And one of the things that I think it's important to remember, we would track internally on sales on promotion, not items on promotion. So it's volume weighted as well, I think, is an important point too. Yes. As you know, when we embarked upon Restock Kroger several years ago, we made the commitment that we would accelerate our associate wages. And as Gary mentioned, now we -- incrementally, it's about $1.2 billion per year that we are investing in supporting our associates. We think supporting our associates is incredibly important. And what we're always trying to do is to make sure that we have solid wages, strong wages and industry-leading benefits, which we do have and making sure that we're keeping food affordable for customers. \n And it's a balance that we're always trying to do. Obviously, we work with the unions, but it's -- we want to make sure that our business is sustainable for the long term and we're creating jobs long term and we're creating career opportunities. And if you look at our store directory, 70% started out as an hourly associate. If you look at department heads, almost all started out as hourly part-time associates, and those are things that are incredibly important. \n So it's obviously a balance. We've strategically, several years ago, decided to invest more in wages because we thought it was important to do. And what we find is, over time, it also reduces turnover. And when you have turnover reduction, obviously, the productivity of somebody that's been working for us for a couple of years is higher than a new hire. \n It really gets back to the cost saves that Gary and I both talked about. Literally, you're looking for every single thing where you can stock something in a different way because if you save a second across our company, it's about $14 million. So it's -- you're looking for every single thing that you can do anywhere in the store, anywhere in a plant or a warehouse to be able to eliminate waste. And we believe that we have a core competency now on how to do that. And those are things that are allowing us to make the investments in our associate wages. I think, Gary, over the last, what, 4 years, our average hourly rate is up 22%. And we've been able to obviously do that at the same time on significantly lowering our OG&A expense. If you look within the quarter, it was pretty consistent. Obviously, you'll have -- in the fourth quarter especially, you'll have some weather that drives it. If you look at so far this quarter, it would look pretty similar to last -- to the fourth quarter on IDs. Overall, on cost increases, for the most part, they were passed through but not every area within the department. So it's really balancing all of the different pieces in terms of cost increases and trying to minimize the impact on the customer. Well, yes, we would be using the same data source. But we would expect within the year, it would be meaningfully higher in the first half versus the second half. But somebody on Gary's team probably have gotten a PhD on the amount of time that he's spent on trying to estimate inflation. And at the end of the day, you basically end up in that spot.\n We would expect SNAP, just a pure number of SNAP households, to be a headwind. But what we find on SNAP is some people switch to buying items with credit card, cash and other things as well. And the other piece of our guidance would reflect in our health and wellness business. There's some third-party plans that weren't profitable that we also are going to move away from or have moved away from that's impacted our number on our guidance as well. As Gary mentioned on the vaccines, that is something we factored into the guidance overall and it's just part of the total puzzle. We would also expect some of that to be offset because we're able to provide more of the regular vaccines that we always have. And some of that focus that went on vaccines, we'll be able to acquire additional customers to offset some of that. So all of that is factored into the guidance we gave. On the identical sales, right now, as long as we can continue to get the cost out, we're able to leverage a pretty modest amounts of identical in terms of being able to leverage. Yes. If you look at labor overall, it's something that we're proud. We're one of the largest union employers in the United States. And we're focused on providing additional -- we go in with the ability and assumption that we're going to continue to invest in our associates. And we have industry-leading benefits and we support their ability to come for a job and make it a career by feeding your future, providing tuition reimbursement and other things to help people continue to achieve a career. \n So we're always balancing all of the pieces. So our associates are critical to our future success. We invest in our associates and I want to make sure that we have a strong, sustainable business so that they're able to support their families as well. And there's nothing more inspiring than when you're in a store and somebody talks about -- the other day, I was at Ralph's and somebody was talking about how they were able to send 4 of their kids to college and 1 was a doctor and 1 was an attorney. And those are the kind of things that is incredibly inspiring to hear our associates talk about. Thanks, Ken. Thank you all for attending today's call. We look forward to engaging with all of you again tomorrow at our business update in Florida. As I always do, I would like to conclude our call by taking a moment to address our associates who many listen in. I'm extremely proud of the things we have accomplished this year and we celebrated many significant milestones. Thank you on behalf of all our team for making Kroger better every day. I'm so proud of you. \n As America's grocer, Kroger is taking action to show our support and solidarity with Ukraine. Today, we are sending emergency food assistance to support refugees through a grant from the Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation to the UN World Food Program Ukraine Emergency Fund. We will match all gifts made by our associates and customers up to $250,000. That concludes our earnings -- fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you. And as I said before, we look forward to seeing many of you tomorrow. Take care."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger continues to execute at a high level and is delivering exceptional results while navigating a rapidly changing environment. Before I get into our results in more detail, I would like to start by echoing Rodney's appreciation to our fantastic associates. Their dedication to serve our customers and support each other throughout the pandemic has been nothing short of incredible.  \n Our performance last year clearly highlights the strength of Kroger's go-to-market strategy as we achieved positive identical sales without fuel and adjusted EPS growth on top of record results in 2020. We also continued to invest in our customers and associates to ensure Kroger is well positioned for future success. These investments were balanced with over $1 billion in cost savings and $150 million of incremental operating profit from alternative profit streams.  \n I will now provide additional color on our full year results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $3.68 per diluted share, up 6% compared to last year. Identical sales, excluding fuel, were positive 0.2% and digital sales on a 2-year stacked basis grew by 113%. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $4.3 billion, up 6% over 2020. Gross margin was 22% of sales for 2021. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 43 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and strategic price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits and growth in alternative profits.  \n The OG&A rate decreased 61 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items, reflecting a reduction in COVID-related costs and cost saving initiatives, partially offset by significant investments in our associates.  \n Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.91 for the quarter, up 12% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 4%, our strongest quarter of the year, with fresh departments leading the way. Kroger's FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 3 basis points compared to the same period last year. The stability in our gross margin rate reflects effective management of cost inflation and sourcing benefits, offset by strategic price investments and higher supply chain costs. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 7 basis points. This was driven by significant investments in our associates, including a year-end associate thank you reward and various asset impairments, offset by decreased COVID-related costs, sales leverage and cost saving initiatives.  \n The LIFO charge for the fourth quarter was $20 million compared to an $84 million credit in the same period last year and represented an $0.11 headwind to EPS in the quarter. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher inflation in most categories, with grocery and meat being the largest contributors. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to successfully navigate many different operating environments, and our team is doing an excellent job managing the current higher inflationary environment. We continue to leverage our data and work closely with our suppliers to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model. We are investing where it matters most to our customers using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization.  \n Our brands is also an important differentiator for Kroger in this environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great quality and great value. Our strategic approach is helping our customers manage their grocery budgets more effectively and is allowing Kroger to maintain a strong price position relative to our key competitors.  \n Fuel also remains an important part of our overall value proposition for our customers, and we continue to invest in our fuel program in 2021. Customers that redeem fuel points spend, on average, 4x more at Kroger and visit 4x more frequently. Our investment in fuel rewards, which is reflected in our supermarket gross margin, also helps customers stretch their dollars further and allowed us to achieve gallon growth of 5% in the fourth quarter, outpacing market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.30 this quarter versus $2.20 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.44 compared to $0.33 in the same quarter in 2020.  \n Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. Our operating results generated exceptional free cash flow in 2021, which resulted in a further strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.63 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. We were also disciplined in accelerating the return of cash to shareholders in 2021. In total, Kroger returned $2.2 billion to investors via a combination of share repurchases and dividends.  \n I'd now like to take a few minutes to discuss our continued commitment to investing in our associates and our deep experience with collective bargaining. Wages at Kroger grew before and during the pandemic. As you know, we committed to significant associate wage investments when we launched our Restock Kroger program at the end of 2017. Kroger has invested an incremental $1.2 billion in associate wages and training over the last 4 years. In addition, we have committed to invest over $1.8 billion during the same time period to help address underfunding and better secure pensions for tens of thousands of associates.  \n Wage, health care and pensions are included in all of the more than 350 collective bargaining agreements that cover approximately 66% of our associates. These contracts are regularly negotiated by our professional labor relations team. Our objective is to negotiate contracts that balance competitive wage increases and affordable health care for associates with keeping groceries affordable for the communities that we serve. Our obligation is to do this in a way that maintains a financially sustainable business. If negotiations do become contentious, we have contingency plans in place to continue to support our communities.  \n During the fourth quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Fred Meyer, King Soopers and our Michigan division, covering more than 20,500 associates. For 2022, we have contract negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Las Vegas, Southern California, Seattle, Indianapolis, Portland, Columbus, Fort Wayne, Chicago and Toledo, in addition to continued negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Little Rock and Memphis. We are actively proposing generous wage increases over the life of the various contracts we are negotiating, and these increases are included in our financial model and our guidance for 2022.  \n We are also communicating to local unions that coming to the table with unrealistic proposals, proposals that do not balance associate investments with keeping groceries affordable for our customers is untenable and undermines our shared goal of growing the company to create more jobs and advancement opportunities for more associates.  \n In closing, let me now provide additional color on the 2022 guidance that we released this morning. While we recognize there remain a number of uncertainties in the economic and geopolitical outlook, we believe the strength of Kroger's go-to-market strategy and our ability to manage multiple levers within our financial model will allow us to continue to build momentum within our business in 2022. We have shared previously that we expect to emerge from the pandemic stronger, and our guidance for 2022 creates a new baseline for FIFO net operating profit that is some $900 million higher than the midpoint of our TSR model would have projected when we announced it in 2019.  \n Our plans contemplate meaningful investments in associate hourly rates as well as investments in delivering greater value for our customers and enhancing our digital capabilities. We expect these investments and the impact of cycling COVID-19 vaccine revenue will be fully offset by tailwinds in our model and allow us to grow adjusted net earnings per diluted share to between $3.75 and $3.85.  \n The tailwinds in our 2022 plan includes sales leverage from growing identical sales without fuel between 2% and 3%. We also expect to deliver cost savings of $1 billion, incremental alternative profit growth largely in line with 2021 and underlying improvement in Kroger Health profitability, excluding vaccine income. Fuel profitability is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year as gallon growth is offset by slightly lower fuel margins.  \n In terms of quarterly cadence for identical sales of our fuel and EPS growth, we expect identical sales without fuel in quarter 1 and quarter 2 will be above the midpoint of our 2% to 3% range as we expect heightened inflation will continue in the first half of the year. We would expect our second half identical sales without fuel to be below the midpoint of our range as we expect the inflation to moderate later in the year as we cycle higher inflation from the second half of 2021. Regarding adjusted EPS, we would expect quarter 1 to be above the annual growth rate range of 2% to 5%, quarter 2 to be below the range and the second half of the year to be within the range.  \n Turning briefly to our capital priorities. We will continue to be disciplined with capital allocation. As you heard this morning, we are increasing capital investments to $3.8 billion to $4 billion in 2022. This reflects some catch-up from the last 2 years, where spend was below original guidance due to COVID-related constraints as well as an acceleration of our strategic initiatives that will drive longer-term earnings growth. At the same time, we expect to generate free cash flow of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. And consistent with our TSR model, we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders as evidenced by the acceleration in share buybacks over the last 6 months.  \n And finally, we are looking forward to spending more time with you at our business update tomorrow when you will hear from key members of our leadership team about our strategic priorities and our path to deliver total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time. With that, I'll turn it back to Rodney. Yes. Thanks, Rupesh. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks and Rodney covered in a moment ago, really proud of the team in the way that we managed the business in Q4 and some of the changes that were happening. From I think what the team did, we're obviously laser-focused on how can we continue to be effective in managing the sourcing approach to how we are leveraging the relationships with our suppliers and using our data.  \n We've been very effective in using our personalization and promotional activities to really sort of target the offers to the customer to make sure that they're seeing the value but that we're also then able to manage those cost increases effectively in the business. \n I think mix is also another important trend that the team is really focused on is how do we ensure that we're upselling customers to better quality products and premiumized products and whether it's adding the cedar plank to the salmon or the seasoning to the shrimp. And some of those opportunities are really important in how the merchandising team are really focused on recognizing some consumer trends in how many of our customers are moving to more meal solutions as well as continuing to look value -- look for value.  \n So overall, we feel really good around the way the team managed our gross margin during the quarter. As we think about going forward into 2022, we continue to focus on, of course, the same elements and continue to manage those pieces tightly while also wanting to make sure we're continuing to deliver value for our customers. And I think to us, really, we look at it more of how do we manage the model overall across gross margin, OG&A and pulling the different levers.  \n And certainly, I think we look at 2022 and think that we'll continue to invest in the customer. We'll continue to manage those different levers. I would suspect that we'll see continued investment in gross margin in 2022 and continued operating leverage in OG&A. But I think the fourth quarter is a good example of where we wouldn't expect to see some of the major volatility or the gap in gross margin and OG&A that we saw across the whole year, for example, in 2021. Yes. Maybe the only thing to add, Rodney. Certainly, as you know, Rupesh, the customer, as we look at our data, defines value in multiple ways. So part of it is the everyday price, part of it is the promotions. It includes our fuel rewards and all the personalization that we offer. And I would say, if we look at our position as we end the year from where we started, we feel very good about the way in which we've been able to deliver value for the customer. And when we look at our price position, we feel we've been able to maintain a very strong position with the customer in terms of how they would perceive the value of the Kroger basket and the value that Kroger's delivering. Well, I think you summarized it well, Rodney. I think, Simeon, we feel about it as you look at our 2021 results and then you think about our guidance '22, it really demonstrates the strength in that, the overall diversity of our model now and the different levers that we're able to pull to make sure that we're investing in our associates, investing in our customers and still able to deliver a strong return for our shareholders. \n And we would agree with you that 2022 is a year where we do expect to make significant investments, whether it's around continuing to support the customer and drive growth in our business, investing in our associates, investing in digital. And of course, we will be cycling some COVID vaccine revenue that will be lower in 2022 than '21. But Rodney mentioned the cost savings and alternative profit benefits that we see within the model. We do continue to expect, obviously, to generate sales leverage in our model as well. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, health and wellness will certainly have some headwinds from COVID vaccines, but we believe there's continued opportunity to improve the underlying profitability in health and wellness as well in 2022. Yes. No, I think the only thing, John, that's really accelerated over the last couple of years, I completely agree with Rodney around the sourcing benefits and the taking cost out of the operation. The one thing that, as you know, we've talked about is we invested in digital to ensure that we're winning the customer to build that $10 billion business that we talked about. And we did that sometimes, recognizing that there'll be some inefficiency in our model. \n And so I think one of the areas that we've been able to accelerate is taking cost out of the digital sort of cost to serve a customer, if you like, as we can leverage more efficiency in that scale. And that's become a tailwind this year and will be -- or was last year and will be in 2022 as part of the cost structure. That's probably the one area that's maybe changed a little bit over the last couple of years, but I completely agree with Rodney. On the balance, it's pretty consistent. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Spencer, as you know, we don't tend to give detailed guidance on the puts and takes in gross margin rate and OG&A rate because we much more view it as how do we manage the business as a whole to drive sustainable earnings growth. I would say that I mentioned it in one of the earlier responses, that we would expect to continue to invest in the customer in 2022. And we'd also actually expect to see some accelerated advertising costs too because we're going to obviously continue to grow the business and we'll talk about it tomorrow, some of the digital growth opportunities that we're focused on as well. \n So I think as we look at the total year, we still expect some investment in gross margin in 2022, but we'd also continue to expect to see significant OG&A leverage as well in many areas through the cost savings that Rodney mentioned. And certainly, we wouldn't expect the gap between those 2 to be anywhere near as wide as it was when you look at the full year results in 2021. So I wouldn't take the fourth quarter as the sort of the number to use, but I would certainly expect us to be tightly managing those. And we do believe, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, all the work the team has done around sourcing, connecting with customers, driving our strategy to deliver value for customers gives us confidence in the overall guidance that we shared for next year. Sure. Yes, it's a great question on fuel. As you know, we talk about this each year, and we used to base our assumptions on a sort of a 3- to 5-year trend. And if you look at the last 3 to 5 years, really, fuel profitability has continued to improve pretty consistently as we look at the trends in our business and how our fuel reward program is connecting and what a great job our team has done in managing fuel margins. I do think there's a little bit of left pocket, right pocket in some of that, of course, as well because we spend a tremendous amount of money in rewarding customers, giving up to over $1 a gallon off for discount for customers that are highly engaged in the program. \n So I think it's important to remember that there are 2 dimensions to it, and we recognize that in our gross margin on the supermarket business and don't flow through on the fuel side because the redemption of those points is tied to when you spend at Kroger in the store online, not tied to specifically the fuel usage. So that's an important factor to remember. \n We believe that the fuel business has sustained improvement in profitability, so we're less focused on the historical trends now because we believe the industry has changed structurally. And we'd expect that to be maintained for us and also because of the strength in our value proposition with the customer. We don't specifically call out details on fuel and total profitability. I would say that actually, broadly speaking, the tailwind on fuel in the fourth quarter largely align with the headwind in LIFO, so the 2 of those pretty much offset each other during the quarter. No, I think you covered it well. I think, Michael, just to add that I think that Rodney's comments are really what causes us to believe that when we talk to our customers and look at our data, we feel we're in a very good position relative to the value that customers receiving from Kroger in this environment and our ability to continue to deliver value for our customers and maintain a strong perception as customers continue to evolve into 2022 and beyond. Yes. Maybe just a couple of things to add, Rodney. When Rodney talked about the last 4 years and the investment we've made, I wouldn't think of that as being the end of the journey when we announced our TSR model. We were actually fully expecting, as we look out towards 2025, that we will continue to invest in our associates and our model when we announced the TSR model of 8% to 11% growth. We actually did expect that we would continue to invest not just over '18, '19 and '20 but continue to invest '21 through 2025. \n So it's always been something that we contemplated in our model. We kind of felt that this was something that would come. And now admittedly, the last 12 months obviously have changed the landscape a little bit. So I would say we've pulled forward some of that thinking. And we would fully expect within our guidance that we've shared, 2022 will be a higher number in wage investments than 2021 was. So we are fully contemplating that with the guidance that we shared, and we expect that growth in wage to continue. And again, it was fully part of our TSR model. \n We'll talk a little bit about tomorrow. But to Rodney's point, one of the reasons that we're increasing our capital investments in 2022 beyond the sort of catch-up of some of the things that were slowed down by COVID is we are going to be investing more in technology. We still feel like as proud as we are of the $1 billion-plus we've saved for the last 4 years, we still think there's a lot of opportunity to use technology even more effectively to take more cost out of the business. And it's one of the reasons that we're accelerating capital because we believe it will help support -- continue to increase efficiency over the next few years as we continue to invest in average hourly rates. And Mary Ellen Adcock will share a little bit more color on that when we see you tomorrow as well. The only other thing I would add that -- Rodney shared this earlier in the Q&A, but we are seeing customers tell us that as inflation is certainly higher in food, which obviously we're all focused on, but inflation is obviously higher pretty much everywhere in the economy right now. And actually, whereas maybe a few months ago, customers were telling us they were eating more food at home because of concerns around COVID, some of that shifted more to -- while food at home inflation is higher, actually relative to other inflation and how I need to manage my budget, food at home is more attractive in terms of helping me be able to manage my budget and manage my dollars. \n So there's a lot of -- I think a lot of factors that are impacting that outlook that we're obviously using the best information we can to forecast and feel good about the guidance that we've shared and our ability to manage different levers if things change. But we recognize our crystal ball isn't perfect and we'll just continue to be dynamic in the way we manage it. Yes, there's lots of puts and takes, as you heard us mention in our 2022 guidance overall, and we would expect there to be cost increases, obviously, from our investment in average hourly wage. And we continue to invest in the customer experience. But overall, factoring in all the elements of our model, we would expect to generate leverage and our OG&A rate would improve in 2022 over 2021 based on all the different pieces coming together in our model. So within 2022, specifically with that 2% to 3% IDs, we would expect to be able to improve the OG&A rate in the year. And Ken, I think just one thing to add. We are obviously trying to listen to feedback carefully, and we've got a sense that there was a desire to hear more about our overall strategy. As we shared in the prepared comments, we feel really good about the investments we have made and are continuing to make in our associates. And we have a team that's very experienced in managing those relationships. But we wanted to make sure, as we had some feedback that you'd like more color, that we try and listen to investor feedback and wanted to make sure we addressed that in the prepared remarks."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. \n Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Co. assumes no obligation to update that information. Our press release and supplemental information regarding the quarter can be found on our website at ir.kroger.com. \n After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] \n I would also like to announce that we will be hosting a business update on March 4, 2022, in Florida with an opportunity to tour our recently opened Kroger delivery customer fulfillment center. We hope that you are able to join us. \n I will now turn the call over to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thank you for joining us today. We often say the holidays are our time to shine. And as we move through the holiday season, we feel great about our ability to deliver. I would like to say a huge thank you to our associates who remain engaged, energized and focused on taking care of our customers. We are incredibly proud of our third quarter results and the underlying momentum in our business. We returned to positive identical sales without fuel for the quarter. We saw triple-digit digital sales growth on a 2-year stack, and we've increased our full year 2021 guidance. Our agility and the commitment from our amazing associates is allowing us to navigate current labor and supply chain conditions and provide the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem. \n Customers are demonstrating more back-to-normal behaviors, and at the same time, are eating more food at home because it's more affordable, convenient and healthier than other options, plus you can do it as a family. This was evidenced by our Thanksgiving holiday shopping behavior. Customers engaged in larger celebrations with friends and family compared to last year. We also saw them continuing to cook at home, leading up to and during the holiday, and select more premium products to elevate the food experience. These are all reasons why we believe the food at home change is structural and not temporary. \n With most people consuming meals at home and grocery stores continuing to capture the majority share of stomach, it is more important than ever that we provide customers with flexibility on how they choose to shop with us. We have the right seamless ecosystem in place to meet our customers' evolving needs. Leading into Thanksgiving, 70% of consumers said that they would be doing more of their holiday shopping in the store this year. At the same time, 84% of consumers said that they will continue to shop online the same amount or more in the future. These seemingly contradictory behaviors are exactly what Kroger's seamless ecosystem was designed to accommodate. \n We know that inflation is having an impact on customers as well. 82% of consumers polled across the country are feeling the impact of inflation, and 1 in 4 consumers are not confident in their finances right now. We are leveraging our data and personalization to enable our customers to stretch their food dollars. We deliver value when customers need it the most with personalized promotions, big packs and dynamic holiday offerings. Our brands also offer our customers flexibility within their spending without compromising, thanks to the wide variety of incredibly high-quality and innovative products at various price points. \n And while price continues to be top of mind, customers continue to desire the freshest food options, and we're there for them, leading with fresh. We grew sales in Natural & Organics as customers continue to gravitate toward better-for-you options. Our fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales without fuel during the quarter as well. We had a record quarter in our alternative farming offerings, which includes new approaches to growing produce, including vertical and indoor farm operations. These offerings expand customers' access to produce picked at the peak of freshness. \n We are very proud to share that Home Chef became a $1 billion brand on an annualized basis in the third quarter as mealtime shortcuts and solutions, as well as new product innovations, have clearly resonated with our customers. \n Kroger is focused on delivering a customer-centric, seamless experience that requires 0 compromise no matter how customers choose to engage with us. We launched 3 new offerings during the quarter that support the plan to double digital sales and digital profitability by 2023. First, Boost by Kroger builds on our industry-leading loyalty program to deliver additional savings and personalized offers to our members. We are encouraged by the initial engagement in the program which is ahead of internal expectations. \n Second, we launched Kroger Delivery Now in partnership with Instacart. This unique convenience and immediacy offering positions us to win more trips with current customers and to bring new customers to the Kroger ecosystem by offering the largest selection of quality fresh products at affordable prices in 30 minutes. Here's what's so special about this offering. It was profitable on day 1, contributing to our goal to double digital profitability by 2023 that was announced during our 2021 Investor Day. \n And third, we announced a strategic collaboration with Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy Baby that will expand our current marketplace offering and provide Kroger shoppers easy access to essential home and baby products. This exclusive offering will be available through both Kroger.com and on a small-scale physical store pilot at select stores beginning in 2022. We continue to be pleased with the rollout of our customer fulfillment centers in Groveland, Florida; and Monroe, Ohio, which are exceeding internal expectations, and we are especially proud of our Net Promoter Scores, driven by our teams, delivering a world-class experience for our customers, and we're really looking forward to hosting you in Groveland early next year. \n Turning now to our supply chain. We feel great about our ability to serve customer needs through the holidays and beyond. This is because our teams have done such a good job, planning well ahead to maintain a full, fresh and friendly customer experience. In fact, our customers took action to prepare for today's supply chain constraints back in the spring. And a great example of leveraging learnings from operating during the pandemic, we kept the additional warehouses originally brought on to support business through COVID to ensure we were able to provide for customers throughout the holiday season as well. \n Because of our team's agility, we are better in stock today than we were a year ago, and we were able to serve customers through the Thanksgiving holiday with items they needed for their celebrations. In fact, we increased our year-over-year pickup fill rate by over 130 basis points during the week of Thanksgiving. We chose to incur significant costs in our supply chain during 2021, which has allowed us to provide our customers today and into 2022. We continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet, and we're working closely with suppliers to mitigate pain points for the customer. \n We are eager to welcome thousands of new associates to our organization as we began an incredible holiday season. Our hybrid hiring event last month contributed to the hiring of over 64,000 new associates during the quarter. We continue to invest in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness and continued investments in associate wages. \n As we reflect on the 1-year anniversary of our Framework for Action in response to racial injustice across the country and in the communities we serve, we are pleased to share our progress with you. Over 405,000 associates have completed diversity and inclusion training. We've increased our strategic hiring partnerships with Historically Black Colleges & Universities and Hispanic-serving institutions from 6 to 17. The Kroger Co. Foundation has awarded more than $3 million in grants to support innovative organizations focused on building more equitable and inclusive communities, and we increased Kroger's diverse supplier spend by 21% to $4.1 billion last year alone and remain on track toward our long-term goal to spend $10 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2030. While we know that there is more work to be done, we are energized and look forward to keeping our stakeholders updated on our progress. \n One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to manage our business successfully in every operating environment. We remain customer obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. \n With that, I would like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our third quarter financials. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney shared this morning, Kroger delivered strong results in the third quarter, highlighting the flexibility of our business model in a dynamic operating environment. Our focus on execution, combined with our disciplined approach to balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and growth in our alternative profit business, is positioning us well for the future. \n Over time, our model has proven to be resilient during different economic scenarios, and this was true again during the third quarter as we grew the top and bottom lines while navigating higher product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply chain constraints. Our identical sales without fuel in the quarter returned to positive, growing 3.1% as we delivered for our customers across our seamless ecosystem, and customers, again, signaled higher food-at-home consumption is here to stay. Adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS both increased year-over-year and grew by compounded annual growth rates of 22% and 29%, respectively, versus 2019. \n Third quarter EPS was impacted by 2 unusual items that were excluded from our adjusted EPS result. First, we engaged in an annuity buyout and lump sum distribution transaction related to the company's consolidated retirement benefit plan which will reduce future administrative costs. This triggered a write-off of deferred losses and a nonrecurring noncash charge of $87 million on a pretax basis. This company pension plan is currently 100% funded as a result of previous action taken to freeze the plan and protect benefits for our associates. This transaction was fully funded by assets in the plan. The second unusual item was Kroger recording a nonrecurring benefit of $47 million or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily due to the favorable outcome of income tax audit examinations, covering multiple years. This amount is also excluded from the company's adjusted net earnings per diluted share result for the third quarter. \n I'll now provide more detail on our operating results in the quarter. On a 2-year stack basis, our identical sales without fuel increased 14%. We also saw digital sales increased 103% on a 2-year stack. As we have previously shared, we do not expect digital growth to be linear, especially as we cycle last year's sales spike and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again. The launch of several new digital offerings, which Rodney outlined earlier, in addition to the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against our growth targets for digital sales and profitability. We look forward to sharing more detail on our digital road map at the business update in March that Rob noted earlier on the call. With regard to digital profitability, we continue to make progress during the quarter and achieved our best cost to serve on record for pickup orders. \n Gross margin was 21.66% of sales for the third quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 41 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and continued price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits. Our investment was in line with expectations and fully funded by cost savings and OG&A improvement. \n Recognizing recent inflation trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a higher LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. This increase represents a $0.07 headwind to EPS in the quarter versus 2020. \n The operating, general and administrative rates decreased 49 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. This improvement was achieved even with continued investments in our associates and growth in our average hourly rate and reflects the outstanding work our associates are doing to execute cost-saving initiatives in a very dynamic environment. We remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings during 2021. \n Our alternative profit business had a record third quarter and remains on track to deliver the high end of our expected range of $100 million to $150 million of incremental operating profit in 2021. We saw increased strength in Kroger Personal Finance results during the quarter, and Kroger Precision Marketing introduced a new programmatic advertising marketplace to unleash first-party targeting and measurement capabilities, further highlighting our ability to differentiate in the advertising space. \n Fuel is also an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars, especially in times when fuel prices are high. During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the number of customers actively engaging in our fuel program. Gallons grew in the third quarter by 5%, outpacing market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.24 this quarter versus $2.15 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.42 compared to $0.37 in the same quarter in 2020. \n I'd now like to spend a couple of minutes providing some additional perspective on how we are proactively managing inflation. We are currently operating in a more volatile inflationary environment. And during the third quarter, Kroger saw higher product cost inflation in most categories. We are being disciplined in managing these increases. Our teams are doing an excellent job, working to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model by using our data and working closely with our suppliers. \n We are passing along higher cost to the customer where it makes sense to do so. In some key areas, we are choosing not to pass through cost increases and continuing to invest in value for the customer. We are investing where it matters most, using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization with the objective of winning long-term customer loyalty. We also believe our brands is an -- is an even more important differentiator for Kroger in an inflationary environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great value and great quality. \n Turning now to our financial strategy. Kroger is operating from a position of strength and continues to generate strong free cash flow as evidenced by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio hitting an all-time low of 1.68 in the third quarter. While we continue to see attractive opportunities to invest in the business, to widen our competitive moat and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth, our capital expenditures in 2021 are now expected to be below our original guidance range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This is because of delays in project implementations, primarily due to COVID-19-related supply challenges. \n Kroger continues to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $297 million of shares, and year-to-date, have repurchased $1 billion of shares. Since 2000, we have now returned more than $20 billion to shareholders via share repurchases at an average price of $16.45 per share. As of the end of the third quarter, $511 million remains outstanding under the current Board authorization announced on June 17, 2021. We look forward to sharing more about our plans for future deployment of excess cash to drive sustainable growth and create value for our shareholders at our business update in March. \n As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest meaningfully in our associates. In addition to the $350 million of hourly rate investment already planned this year, we have committed to further investments in the fourth quarter, which equates to an incremental $100 million on an annualized basis. \n During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in our Columbus and Mid-Atlantic divisions, covering over 4,500 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Lake Charles, Freeport, Dallas meat, Little Rock, Memphis, Portland and Denver. Our financial results are pressured by inefficiencies in health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local and international unions, which represent many of our associates about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. \n I'll now turn to our expectations for the remainder of 2021. Driven by the momentum in our third quarter results and sustained trends in food at home, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect identical sales without fuel for the full year to be between negative 0.4% and negative 0.2% and a 2-year identical sales stack of between 13.7% to 13.9%. There remain some uncertainties as we look ahead, and our guidance of positive ID sales excluding fuel of between 1.5% to 2.5% in the fourth quarter reflects this. We expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50. We expect our adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, reflecting a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of between 17% and 18.4%. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range for 2021 now equates to full year results, approximately in line with our 2020 results, despite cycling the unique COVID-19-related demand spike last year. \n Our guidance fully reflects the investments in our customers and associates I shared earlier, plus increased marketing to support the exciting new digital initiatives we launched in the third quarter. It also reflects the latest projection for LIFO. And because we recorded a LIFO credit in the fourth quarter last year, LIFO is now expected to be a $0.13 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter. Overall, we are very proud of our results, which are projected to be significantly ahead of where we originally guided for the year. \n In conclusion, Kroger is executing against its key financial and operational initiatives and continues to invest in strategic priorities that will deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. We believe our business is emerging stronger through the pandemic and through the investments we are making is well positioned to grow beyond 2021. \n I'll now turn it back to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Kroger's strong year-to-date results are the outcome of our customer obsession, our incredible associates who bring our vision and values to life and our commitment to bringing fresh, affordable food to everyone. The strength of our teams have never been more apparent. With every new challenge, they raised to the occasion, whether by implementing solutions to minimize supply chain disruptions, delivering the freshest produce to our customers or using our data to offer personalized promotions that surprise and delight. Our team is bringing our competitive moats to life. \n Now we look forward to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. \nRobert Moskow: You've obviously done a very good job of passing on inflation to consumers while shielding that at the same time. Your gross profit dollars are up now. Can you talk a little bit about what came -- what drove that outperformance versus your expectations last quarter? Because last quarter, I think you were pretty cautious on gross margin. \n And then secondly, I think there's another big tranche of pricing coming in January from a lot of your vendors. How would you characterize that next tranche? Is it an unusually high acceleration? Or is it just kind of a continued acceleration similar to what you've seen so far? Maybe if you could even put it into context of CPI for us, it would be helpful. \nW. McMullen: Okay. Rob, I'll start, and I'll let Gary get into more of the details. First of all, I think it's important to remember what's allowing us to continue to invest in the customer and value is the great work our team is doing on cost reductions. And as Gary mentioned, we're on track to take $1 billion of cost out, and this is the fourth year in a row that we've been able to accomplish that, which really gives us the flexibility to be able to continue to invest in our customers. The other thing that our teams have done a nice job on, if you look at our procurement team, they've done a nice job of identifying opportunities to save money by working with our suppliers, and we continue to aggressively work in partnership with them. \n If you look at inflation during the quarter, it continued to increase throughout the quarter. As of right now, it's starting to stabilize but obviously at a pretty high rate. So it's something that we aggressively use our data to understand, and we aggressively try to make sure that the customer has alternatives to be able to stretch their budget as well. And that's -- in some cases, that's switching to a cheaper price meat. In some cases, it's buying our brands which has amazing quality as well. \n So with that, Gary, I'll let you get into more -- some more of the details for Rob. \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Rob. Yes. I would say, Rob, obviously, when we guided at the second quarter, we said that the gross margin contraction could be similar to what we were seeing in Q2. And I would say the dynamics that are in place haven't changed dramatically. Obviously, it's a dynamic environment that we're managing, and our goal, as Rodney mentioned, is to continue to find sourcing benefit and savings to offset the cost increases where we see them and to pass on pricing where it makes sense but also to keep investing in the customer. And I'd say that we -- in Q2, we were doing that. In Q3, we've continued to do that. \n Supply chain would have been a similar sort of headwind in Q2 and Q3. I would say we were successful in mitigating some of the cost increases in shrink during the quarter, which helped during the quarter, although we still think shrink is a dynamic metric to manage based on some of the organized crime that we see in shrink. But overall, we were pleased with the progress in shrink during the quarter. And I think, for us, we kind of guided, while we never get into specific numbers on individual gross margin and OG&A metrics because, as Rodney mentioned there, our goal is to be dynamic in managing it, ensuring that we're delivering sustainably for our customers and growing loyalty while also being able to improve profitability over time by managing the different levers across selling growth rate, cost of goods savings, taking cost out of the business and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. \n So I think it's a dynamic environment we continue to manage. I think somewhere between the Q2 and Q3 range is where we think that we're operating right now. We think Q4 would likely be similar to what we've seen in Q2 and Q3. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are increasing some advertising in the fourth quarter to support the accelerated growth in some of those new initiatives. \n So I think, again, I wouldn't be guiding to a specific number, but in the range that you've seen in Q2 and Q3 is where we feel comfortable in managing the business and driving the right balance of sustainable growth for shareholders while continuing to win customer loyalty over time. \nRobert Moskow: And just a quick follow-up. I think Rodney said that you're seeing your inflation kind of leveling off. Are you looking at like PPI inflation there? Because I would agree with you, it seems like in the low teens, it's leveling off. Is that what you're looking at? \nW. McMullen: Yes. We would be looking at more of our own costs in terms of what we're incurring and what we see coming forward. And one of the other things that I always think it's important to remind people, we manufacture a lot of our own products, so we also understand the raw materials themselves and what's going on there. And we would be looking at CPI and PPI both. But in terms of trying to estimate inflation, we would be looking at our actual cost increases that we're incurring. \nOperator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Goldman: Rodney, I'm glad you mentioned the fact that you make your own products because that's a good lead into one of my questions, which is we're still seeing, at least in the scanner data that we get, some pretty poor trends on top of last year's poor trends for store brands in general. I'm not talking about Kroger. I'm talking across the measured industry. And I'm just hoping for an update for what you're seeing there. I know you've talked about this a little bit in the past, but are there any signs of improvement from that? And again, I know you're somewhat agnostic you'll make money either way. I'm just trying to get a sense for what the outlook is, what you're seeing, any updates from your side. \nW. McMullen: If you look at our brands, if you look at the third quarter trends, they were better than the second quarter trends. And if you look within the quarter, it improved during the trends. \n Ken, the point you made is, for us, we want to make sure we have the products customers want. So a Kroger brand item has to earn its right on the shelf, just like any other brand. But for us, it's obviously one of our competitive moats. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and we did a press release earlier in the quarter, we were proud that Home Chef became our fourth brand on -- that is over $1 billion a year. Our brands, for us, is incredibly important on our connection with our customers because it's an incredible great value for our customers with amazing quality. And when you look at Simple Truth and Private Selection, both of those brands offer something that's unique in the marketplace and continue to grow aggressively. Private Selection, most of the items are things that you can't get somewhere else, and Simple Truth just makes it super easy for a customer to eat healthy. So the trends are improving. But for us, it is an incredibly important part of our overall strategic strategy and a competitive moat. \nKenneth Goldman: And then quick follow-up. I think you mentioned that you're not passing on cost increases fully in either certain categories or certain products. Is it safe to assume that, like many of your peers, you're a little more hesitant to take pricing up on items that draw people into stores on a regular basis, things like milk and bread, et cetera? Or is it a little more strategic and nuanced than that? Just trying to get a sense for how you're thinking about which items to take pricing up on and which not. \nW. McMullen: Yes. We would be using our data and our historical data over the last several years on elasticity by category and by products within categories on deciding what to pass through or not. We would also -- just on certain products, it's an opportunity to create deeper loyalty, some of which is obvious, some of which is not. And some of the items in the past wouldn't have the same amount of penetration across households as what they used to do. So it really is dynamic information that's based on what's going on right now in the market. \n The other thing just to -- our data would also show in different parts of the country some of those elasticities would be different. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? \nGary Millerchip: No. I think you've covered it well. \nW. McMullen: Okay. Thanks, Ken. \nOperator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Kessler: This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Can you hear me? \nW. McMullen: Yes. \nMichael Kessler: First, I wanted to ask about any initial thoughts, if you have any, on 2022, another good quarter in Q3. It looks like the full year is going to end up basically a retention or maybe slight growth off of 2021 on earnings. So I guess any more confidence or conviction that next year could be another, call it, algo type of year on both IDs and EBIT? And I guess any puts and takes as you're starting to think through that outlook? \nW. McMullen: It's a good question, and we appreciate it. Obviously, we'll get into a lot more detail when we get out to our March Investor Day. That's really when we'll go into depth. We're in the middle of going through -- developing our budgets and partnering with our Board on our 2022 expectations. The only comment that I would give in depth is, as we shared in our Investor Day in 2019 and we've continually updated, over time, we would expect a TSR of 8% to 11% on an annualized basis, made up of earnings growth and free cash flow, made up -- and returning cash to shareholders. \n So overall, we would expect that. We do feel good about the momentum in the business in terms of the connections with the customer, our seamless business processes on identifying ways to take cost out, so we can invest some of those cost savings in our associate wages, cost savings and the customer connection and other things. So -- and the business continues to generate good cash flow. \n Gary, it looks like you want to say something. \nGary Millerchip: Well, I think you said it well, Rodney. I would just add where you were going. I think we're -- hopefully, we've been conveying very clearly, while we won't be getting into detailed guidance for 2022 because that's the first of March meeting, we've been trying to be clearing all of that communication, I think, around the confidence we have in the long-term prospects of the business, so not specific to '22, but thinking as we're continuing to build the business from the base that we've established through COVID that the opportunity to grow and deliver on that TSR commitment that Rodney mentioned. And specifically, we do believe that some of the food-at-home trends that we've talked a lot about. We've said for some time and continue to believe that data shows that a number of those changes will be structural in nature, and we'll continue to see sustained trends in food at home. \n I think if you look at our performance over the last 2 years that Rodney was alluding to some of the individual drivers, but I think it's demonstrated in our mind the confidence in the value creation model that we're creating, the balance in our model to be able to drive sustainable growth. And the alternative profit stream is continuing to grow at double digits off a higher base. So certainly, I would endorse Rodney's comment more broadly around that commitment to TSR over time. But obviously, we'll get into more details on 2022 in March. \nSimeon Gutman: And it's Simeon for the follow-up. I thought maybe Michael might have a better shot at the '22 question than me. But my follow-up is on the puts and takes on IDs. It looks like it held pretty consistent, Q2 to Q3, and you talked about inflation lifting but leveling. Can you talk about anything, puts and takes sequentially got worse or better in terms of units, traffic, et cetera? \nW. McMullen: If you look at most pieces, it would -- third quarter would have been better than second quarter. If you look at household trends, if you look at -- basket size would have been a little bit smaller but not significantly. We continue to see people -- premiumization during both the quarter. We continue to see people buying larger pack sizes on just about every category. So when you look at the puts and takes, I think there's as many puts and takes. \nGary Millerchip: Maybe just to add, Rodney. Yes, Simeon, I mean, the trends were pretty consistent through the quarter in Q3. They got slightly better as the quarter went on, and we would be trending at the top end of the range that we shared in the quarter-to-date so far, top end of the range that we shared for guidance for Q4. And if you look at the trend so far in this quarter, I would say that the quarter would have started a little bit slower because of -- we were cycling in that week before Thanksgiving a fairly large spike in consumer behavior that I think started to signal maybe a potential increase in cases this time last year, and then Thanksgiving was very strong. We were very pleased with the results over the Thanksgiving week itself. \n I think some of the questions in our mind as we look towards Q4 that are some of the reasons that we guided to some of the uncertainties, it's hard to predict exactly what will happen with government stimulus dollars in the market, particularly at the state level. That's kind of really hard to get over the skin of what will happen in individual states around ongoing funding. We obviously know there are some continued supply chain challenges around product availability in certain categories, and that's getting better gradually but still has certainly some challenges in the market. And it will be those kind of things that, for us, would be the puts and takes in how strong Q4 plays out in our mind. \nOperator: The next question is from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Global Research. \nRobert Ohmes: I guess, Gary, for you, could you -- I wanted to just follow up on the sourcing benefits to gross margin. Can you remind us what you're doing to achieve kind of sourcing benefits in this environment? And also, you're doing an amazing job with the cost savings initiatives, offsetting labor and other cost pressures. Can you remind us also there, what you've been doing? And maybe some thoughts on how sustainable those 2 things could be into next year? \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes. We're really proud of the team's work in those areas, as you mentioned. It started out at the beginning of Restock Kroger. There is a sort of let's grab the opportunities that are immediately in front of us, and I think it's really become a core competency within the organization to drive sustainable savings in our model. \n On the sourcing side, I think I would describe it across a number of different areas. You start with how do you make sure you're consolidating all the buying in the right places, so you can maximize the data and knowledge and use our own experiences from the cost of commodities and the fact we manufacture many of our products so that we're getting smarter and more effective in how we buy. It's evolved into product design and packaging design and how do you really optimize the value while not compromising on quality for the customer, so continuing to drive value in those areas. It's extended to the GPO partnership that we created with Walgreens and looking at how can you consolidate opportunities and best thinking there as well. \n So it continues to evolve for us, and the team is doing a great job in finding those opportunities to maximize savings. And we would expect that to be a continued opportunity for us because we keep identifying new innovative ways to ensure that we're designing for value and maximizing opportunities to be more efficient.\n On the sort of the OG&A side of things, that's across a number of different areas as well. So it would include using technology and automation to reduce shrink and waste in the business, to improve on some of those activities in the store and our operations that are very manual and don't really maximize the value that our great associates can deliver for customers, so taking that non-value-added work out wherever we can to allow our associates to focus on the customer. It includes automating our ordering and production planning-type processes. \n One of the big ones, of course, this year that we think would expect to be a tailwind into next year as well for every dollar that we can capture this year would be taking cost out of our digital cost to serve. So we've invested significant labor over the years in building that digital ecosystem, and we'd expect to continue to grow that business, of course. But if we can take out -- if we can improve efficiency on that $10 billion digital business, it creates not just a saving on the next new sale, but it creates a saving on that baseline $10 billion business as well. \n And then finally, I would say we've taken the opportunity to use things like the learnings through COVID on things like administrative costs and where are there areas you can actually work more efficiently and operate in more of a hybrid environment to take cost out of the model as well. \n So I hope that gives you an idea of the way it's kind of really become embedded more in the business, and we certainly would expect as part of our overall TSR growth model to be continuing to take costs to be able to fund investments in our average hourly rate for associates, to be able to invest in pricing and value for the customer while at the same time growing shareholder returns. \nW. McMullen: Robbie, the only other thing I would add to Gary's comments, and it's implied throughout Gary's comments, but we have done a lot of people changes -- talent changes, both in terms of recruiting people from within the company but external as well outside of the industry that have skills that were different than traditional in our industry, which has been a huge help in both areas for us to think about things in new ways and for people to approach things in new ways as well. \nRobert Ohmes: That's great. That's really helpful. And one really quick follow-up question, if I may. With the changes you're making on the sourcing side and with own brands, can -- what is happening with total SKUs versus national brands SKUs versus owned brands SKUs in your stores? Are they shrinking? Are some growing? Can you give us any color on that? \nW. McMullen: If you look at before COVID, the number of SKUs would be lower now than before, just because it's -- you don't have as much change time and things like that. There are selective areas where some of the national players haven't reintroduced some of the variety that we are introducing some of that variety in our own brands, and we introduced over 200 new SKUs in the quarter, and we would have an aggressive pipeline going forward. \n But overall, if you look at -- there's still continued SKU growth in natural organics, plant-based areas like that. And you will -- and if you think about like paper towels and paper goods and things like that, you would see fewer SKUs, just because the customers move to purchasing bigger-size packages. \nOperator: The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. \nSpencer Hanus: This is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. I just wanted to ask how you're thinking about the delta between retail and cost inflation in '22. And then what is the breadth and depth of promotions that you need to hit your long-term top line targets, just given the unique opportunity the industry has had to reset promos over the last 18-plus months here? \nW. McMullen: Gary, you want to... \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, Spencer. As we mentioned, we're kind of not really providing sort of an outlook for 2022 at this point around how we think about sales and investments overall. We'll be doing that, for sure, as we get to the March meeting and sharing our Q4 results. \n I think, really, I would pivot back to some of the comments that we made earlier around we think very much of it from the perspective of in all operating environments, Kroger has been able to demonstrate our ability to navigate through those situations. And it really comes back to what we were talking about earlier around ensuring that we understand the customer better than anybody, using our data, our targeting, our promotional activity and our personalized pricing, and of course, where the pricing structure of product starts to change, really ensuring that customers see the value in our own brand products because of the great quality and value that they offer in combination. And during times of high inflation and certainly in times of economic challenge, we found that Kroger has performed very well, and we've seen customers pivot to some of those opportunities based on the way we can communicate and connect customers with those strategies. \n So I think from our perspective, we're very much managing the business dynamically to ensure that we can deliver for the customer, but at the same time, deliver on our TSR commitments in the way that we talked about earlier in the conversation. \nW. McMullen: On promotions, we would always use our insights because different types of customers react different types of promotions. So we would aggressively use our insights to personalize promotions. A lot of that is one-on-one with a customer, either sending an old-fashioned mailing or electronically with e-mail or text or whatever. And it really depends on each customer and what do they test react to. \nSpencer Hanus: Got it. That's helpful. And then in the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that the Ocado facility is performing better than expected, the one in Florida. But could you just provide some more details on the basket size and the repeat orders relative to your targets? And then how are you thinking about the need, longer term, to build or acquire stores in that market to provide a more complete omni experience down there? \nW. McMullen: Yes. On your second question, I'll answer it first, and you got to walk before you run. So right now, we're totally focused on making sure that the sheds open strongly, and we continue to maintain outstanding NPS scores, or net promoter scores, with our customers. And I am super proud of our team in Florida and Monroe, both in terms of how they continue to connect with the customer and continue to improve. \n If you look at basket size, the basket size continues to grow. And what we expected and what we believe is as the customers begin to trust the experience, begin to have good experiences, we get a higher share of their total spend. And that's what we're starting to see. \n And when you look at overall in Florida, one of the reasons why we announced the 2 additional facilities in Florida is obviously the connection and the growth that we are achieving. So far, we feel good about the opportunity in Florida. And as everybody knows, the population growth in Florida and the economic growth in Florida is just mind-boggling relative to an awful lot of the country. So it's an incredible opportunity for all grocery retailers in Florida. Obviously, the offering we have is unique in the market and very proud of what we're getting done there. \nGary Millerchip: And the repeat usage, Rodney, is higher than we expected, right, than net promoter score. \nW. McMullen: Yes. \nOperator: The next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: Rodney, let me start with -- if you would -- how consumer behavior has evolved over the last couple of years. In terms of what percent of purchases, right, are done, shelf price versus promo versus personalized promo. How has that shifted, right? And if you think about personalized promo, is that as much as 50% or something along those lines of what purchases are occurring? And then the work you've done on price perception, how has that trended maybe early days of COVID to where we are today? \nW. McMullen: If you look at customer behavior, I want to broaden it a little bit on -- relative to your question. We continue to see people focus on health. If you look at early in COVID, people were not as focused on health, but they're definitely back where they're focused on health in a more aggressive way. All across the board, you see premiumization on what people do. And I always say I'm a reasonably aggressive shopper in our Murray's Cheese. Growing up, I would have never had really good cheese. And once you have a really good cheese, it's hard to go back to what you were used to when you -- before. And what we're finding is customers, when they upgrade and try higher-quality product, they find out they love it, and they become loyal to it. \n If you look at customers in terms of behavior and buying on promotion, it's been reasonably consistent throughout the pandemic. People stretch their budget where they need to or want to because -- and they will splurge in other places, which is one of the things that -- from a go-to-market standpoint that we really try to help a customer stretch their budget on things that are important to them, so they can splurge on what's important to them as well. \nJohn Heinbockel: All right. Maybe just a quick one for Gary. You guys now have something on the order of $4 billion to $5 billion, right, of dry powder in terms of your leverage target. How do you think about that conceptually in terms of timing, in terms of return to shareholders versus strategic M&A. What's the philosophy there? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, John. Obviously, we are really proud of the business performance, and it has demonstrated strength in the overall model and the position that we're in, as we said in the prepared comments. I would say our overall capital allocation strategy is unchanged, that we start with where are the opportunities to invest in capital in the business to drive sustainable growth. We're obviously in a great position around maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, and we've been able to make some good progress on chipping away at the pension funding from an overall sort of debt and potential liability there as well. \n This year, of course, we've been very committed to continuing to return cash to shareholders with the $1 billion, so far, on buybacks and the 17% increase in the dividend that we announced earlier in the year. So I think we've been very consistent with that plan so far. \n We do think that in the short term, it's important to maintain some flexibility, recognizing some of the uncertainty in the market that we've all talked about, that we're all navigating through at the moment. That being said, within those principles, we do think it's important, and we've been very committed, as you know, as a company, to being very disciplined with cash flow and deploying it to either grow the business or return to shareholders. \n So as we head towards 2022 and as we move towards the March planning meeting and the business update meeting that Rob shared, we'd certainly expect to share more color of how we're thinking about the excess cash and some of the opportunities we're exploring there. \nW. McMullen: And we would continue to look for things that are the right opportunity for things that add capabilities. So if you think about merging with Home Chef a couple of years ago, it was a capability that we didn't have on the direct-to-customer meal kits, and we've been able to partner with the team there to leverage it back within Kroger as well. \n So -- and I always think it's important to remind people that we're not required to do any kind of mergers in order to achieve our TSR of 8% to 11% as well. \nOperator: The next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. \nCharles Cerankosky: Great quarter. Rodney, I think, as you earlier mentioned, that you chose to incur some significant costs in the -- to bolster the supply chain in the quarter. Can you give us some detail on that and whether they last into next year? And then I have a follow-up related to that. \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the supply chain investments, it was pretty similar to what we did in the second quarter. Now our team has done a nice job of starting to identify some opportunities for efficiency. One of the biggest areas is that we continue to have extra warehouse space, and I guess I hesitate to call it extra warehouse space because we're actually using the warehouse space. But -- and over time, as we feel like things are permanent, you'll see us do more permanent-type warehouse projects to expand capacity rather than using it maybe in a way that's not as efficient. \n We would expect to continue to do that in the fourth quarter. \n As we look out next year, we really are working hard to make sure we stay agile in that area because things continue to change so quickly and what's going on with COVID, what's the COVID variance and things like that. So we really are making the decisions on an agile basis, and it's one of the learnings that we've had early on in the pandemic, and we'll continue to do that relative to the supply chain as well. \nCharles Cerankosky: Anything on the labor side worth noting? And then also, when you're talking about the supply chain issues and product outages, is it -- are we talking about branded versus private label, fresh versus shelf-stable, edible versus nonedible products? I mean, where are you seeing the need to spend the most money and use the most management resources to make sure the shareholders that. \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at labor, we certainly have partnered with outside companies to supplement our labor resources, especially on the supply chain. If you look at in-stocks, they would be more affected on center store. If you look in the fresh departments, we would be in much better shape in most of the fresh departments in terms of in-stock. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMark Carden: This is Mark Carden on for Michael today. As a follow-up to some of the earlier inflation questions, where do price gaps stand today? And what's the posture on further investments from here? And have competitors been acting as rationally, given just the heightened inflation this time around? \nW. McMullen: If you look at -- as everybody knows, we go to market as a high/low merchant. So we're aggressive on promotion. We're aggressively using promotion. And we feel very good about where we stand relative to price gaps. And if you look at -- our strategy has always been to neutralize on price and win on our fresh areas and our friendliness and connection our associates have with our customers. And that continues to work well, and we continue to feel good about where we are relative to the various gaps. \nMark Carden: Great. That's helpful. And then on Ocado, how integrated is the GFC today with your Cincinnati operations? Has it been integrated in click and collect yet? And then in Florida, who do you think you're taking the most share from? \nW. McMullen: If you look at Florida, I think the growth in the market is so strong that I think every -- all boats are rising in Florida. So to say that we're taking share away from somebody, I really don't think of it that way because I just think the market is growing so much. \n If you look at your first part of your question on Monroe, we continue to further integrate it within the store network. And it's something that, literally, every single week that goes by, we further integrate to really make it a seamless experience for the customer. \nRob Quast: Thanks for your questions, and that will end our question-and-answer session. \nW. McMullen: As Rob said, thanks for questions. Obviously, thank you for your interest in Kroger. As you know, many of our associates own stock, and we always use the end of this to communicate directly with our associates as well. And as all of us embrace the holiday season, it often becomes a time where we can -- of reflection as we sit down to enjoy special meals with our loved ones. \n And as I said earlier, I am just so incredibly proud of our associates across the Kroger Family of Companies and what we, as a team, have accomplished this year. Everyone of our associates is helping make the holidays brighter and fresher for our customers, and more importantly, for that customer and their family. And it doesn't matter if you're making a difference together, like our Kroger Health team, who has administrated 8.5 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, or as individuals like Donna Greer, a cashier at our store 387 in Collierville, Tennessee, whose unshakable positivity has been an inspiration to many, including the Collierville Herald-Independent who just named her Collierville Woman of the Year. We are so proud of Donna, and congratulations, Donna. \n When you look at these, they are just a few examples of our incredible people who bring our vision and values to life each and every day. Our associates are beyond amazing and continue to serve our communities and uplift each other and our customers. \n That concludes our call for today. We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and encourage you to stay safe. And as always, thank you for your interest in Kroger. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. We often say the holidays are our time to shine. And as we move through the holiday season, we feel great about our ability to deliver. I would like to say a huge thank you to our associates who remain engaged, energized and focused on taking care of our customers. We are incredibly proud of our third quarter results and the underlying momentum in our business. We returned to positive identical sales without fuel for the quarter. We saw triple-digit digital sales growth on a 2-year stack, and we've increased our full year 2021 guidance. Our agility and the commitment from our amazing associates is allowing us to navigate current labor and supply chain conditions and provide the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem. \n Customers are demonstrating more back-to-normal behaviors, and at the same time, are eating more food at home because it's more affordable, convenient and healthier than other options, plus you can do it as a family. This was evidenced by our Thanksgiving holiday shopping behavior. Customers engaged in larger celebrations with friends and family compared to last year. We also saw them continuing to cook at home, leading up to and during the holiday, and select more premium products to elevate the food experience. These are all reasons why we believe the food at home change is structural and not temporary. \n With most people consuming meals at home and grocery stores continuing to capture the majority share of stomach, it is more important than ever that we provide customers with flexibility on how they choose to shop with us. We have the right seamless ecosystem in place to meet our customers' evolving needs. Leading into Thanksgiving, 70% of consumers said that they would be doing more of their holiday shopping in the store this year. At the same time, 84% of consumers said that they will continue to shop online the same amount or more in the future. These seemingly contradictory behaviors are exactly what Kroger's seamless ecosystem was designed to accommodate. \n We know that inflation is having an impact on customers as well. 82% of consumers polled across the country are feeling the impact of inflation, and 1 in 4 consumers are not confident in their finances right now. We are leveraging our data and personalization to enable our customers to stretch their food dollars. We deliver value when customers need it the most with personalized promotions, big packs and dynamic holiday offerings. Our brands also offer our customers flexibility within their spending without compromising, thanks to the wide variety of incredibly high-quality and innovative products at various price points. \n And while price continues to be top of mind, customers continue to desire the freshest food options, and we're there for them, leading with fresh. We grew sales in Natural & Organics as customers continue to gravitate toward better-for-you options. Our fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales without fuel during the quarter as well. We had a record quarter in our alternative farming offerings, which includes new approaches to growing produce, including vertical and indoor farm operations. These offerings expand customers' access to produce picked at the peak of freshness. \n We are very proud to share that Home Chef became a $1 billion brand on an annualized basis in the third quarter as mealtime shortcuts and solutions, as well as new product innovations, have clearly resonated with our customers. \n Kroger is focused on delivering a customer-centric, seamless experience that requires 0 compromise no matter how customers choose to engage with us. We launched 3 new offerings during the quarter that support the plan to double digital sales and digital profitability by 2023. First, Boost by Kroger builds on our industry-leading loyalty program to deliver additional savings and personalized offers to our members. We are encouraged by the initial engagement in the program which is ahead of internal expectations. \n Second, we launched Kroger Delivery Now in partnership with Instacart. This unique convenience and immediacy offering positions us to win more trips with current customers and to bring new customers to the Kroger ecosystem by offering the largest selection of quality fresh products at affordable prices in 30 minutes. Here's what's so special about this offering. It was profitable on day 1, contributing to our goal to double digital profitability by 2023 that was announced during our 2021 Investor Day. \n And third, we announced a strategic collaboration with Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy Baby that will expand our current marketplace offering and provide Kroger shoppers easy access to essential home and baby products. This exclusive offering will be available through both Kroger.com and on a small-scale physical store pilot at select stores beginning in 2022. We continue to be pleased with the rollout of our customer fulfillment centers in Groveland, Florida; and Monroe, Ohio, which are exceeding internal expectations, and we are especially proud of our Net Promoter Scores, driven by our teams, delivering a world-class experience for our customers, and we're really looking forward to hosting you in Groveland early next year. \n Turning now to our supply chain. We feel great about our ability to serve customer needs through the holidays and beyond. This is because our teams have done such a good job, planning well ahead to maintain a full, fresh and friendly customer experience. In fact, our customers took action to prepare for today's supply chain constraints back in the spring. And a great example of leveraging learnings from operating during the pandemic, we kept the additional warehouses originally brought on to support business through COVID to ensure we were able to provide for customers throughout the holiday season as well. \n Because of our team's agility, we are better in stock today than we were a year ago, and we were able to serve customers through the Thanksgiving holiday with items they needed for their celebrations. In fact, we increased our year-over-year pickup fill rate by over 130 basis points during the week of Thanksgiving. We chose to incur significant costs in our supply chain during 2021, which has allowed us to provide our customers today and into 2022. We continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet, and we're working closely with suppliers to mitigate pain points for the customer. \n We are eager to welcome thousands of new associates to our organization as we began an incredible holiday season. Our hybrid hiring event last month contributed to the hiring of over 64,000 new associates during the quarter. We continue to invest in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness and continued investments in associate wages. \n As we reflect on the 1-year anniversary of our Framework for Action in response to racial injustice across the country and in the communities we serve, we are pleased to share our progress with you. Over 405,000 associates have completed diversity and inclusion training. We've increased our strategic hiring partnerships with Historically Black Colleges & Universities and Hispanic-serving institutions from 6 to 17. The Kroger Co. Foundation has awarded more than $3 million in grants to support innovative organizations focused on building more equitable and inclusive communities, and we increased Kroger's diverse supplier spend by 21% to $4.1 billion last year alone and remain on track toward our long-term goal to spend $10 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2030. While we know that there is more work to be done, we are energized and look forward to keeping our stakeholders updated on our progress. \n One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to manage our business successfully in every operating environment. We remain customer obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. \n With that, I would like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our third quarter financials. Gary? Thanks, Gary. Kroger's strong year-to-date results are the outcome of our customer obsession, our incredible associates who bring our vision and values to life and our commitment to bringing fresh, affordable food to everyone. The strength of our teams have never been more apparent. With every new challenge, they raised to the occasion, whether by implementing solutions to minimize supply chain disruptions, delivering the freshest produce to our customers or using our data to offer personalized promotions that surprise and delight. Our team is bringing our competitive moats to life. \n Now we look forward to your questions. Okay. Rob, I'll start, and I'll let Gary get into more of the details. First of all, I think it's important to remember what's allowing us to continue to invest in the customer and value is the great work our team is doing on cost reductions. And as Gary mentioned, we're on track to take $1 billion of cost out, and this is the fourth year in a row that we've been able to accomplish that, which really gives us the flexibility to be able to continue to invest in our customers. The other thing that our teams have done a nice job on, if you look at our procurement team, they've done a nice job of identifying opportunities to save money by working with our suppliers, and we continue to aggressively work in partnership with them. \n If you look at inflation during the quarter, it continued to increase throughout the quarter. As of right now, it's starting to stabilize but obviously at a pretty high rate. So it's something that we aggressively use our data to understand, and we aggressively try to make sure that the customer has alternatives to be able to stretch their budget as well. And that's -- in some cases, that's switching to a cheaper price meat. In some cases, it's buying our brands which has amazing quality as well. \n So with that, Gary, I'll let you get into more -- some more of the details for Rob. Yes. We would be looking at more of our own costs in terms of what we're incurring and what we see coming forward. And one of the other things that I always think it's important to remind people, we manufacture a lot of our own products, so we also understand the raw materials themselves and what's going on there. And we would be looking at CPI and PPI both. But in terms of trying to estimate inflation, we would be looking at our actual cost increases that we're incurring. If you look at our brands, if you look at the third quarter trends, they were better than the second quarter trends. And if you look within the quarter, it improved during the trends. \n Ken, the point you made is, for us, we want to make sure we have the products customers want. So a Kroger brand item has to earn its right on the shelf, just like any other brand. But for us, it's obviously one of our competitive moats. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and we did a press release earlier in the quarter, we were proud that Home Chef became our fourth brand on -- that is over $1 billion a year. Our brands, for us, is incredibly important on our connection with our customers because it's an incredible great value for our customers with amazing quality. And when you look at Simple Truth and Private Selection, both of those brands offer something that's unique in the marketplace and continue to grow aggressively. Private Selection, most of the items are things that you can't get somewhere else, and Simple Truth just makes it super easy for a customer to eat healthy. So the trends are improving. But for us, it is an incredibly important part of our overall strategic strategy and a competitive moat. Yes. We would be using our data and our historical data over the last several years on elasticity by category and by products within categories on deciding what to pass through or not. We would also -- just on certain products, it's an opportunity to create deeper loyalty, some of which is obvious, some of which is not. And some of the items in the past wouldn't have the same amount of penetration across households as what they used to do. So it really is dynamic information that's based on what's going on right now in the market. \n The other thing just to -- our data would also show in different parts of the country some of those elasticities would be different. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? Okay. Thanks, Ken. Yes. It's a good question, and we appreciate it. Obviously, we'll get into a lot more detail when we get out to our March Investor Day. That's really when we'll go into depth. We're in the middle of going through -- developing our budgets and partnering with our Board on our 2022 expectations. The only comment that I would give in depth is, as we shared in our Investor Day in 2019 and we've continually updated, over time, we would expect a TSR of 8% to 11% on an annualized basis, made up of earnings growth and free cash flow, made up -- and returning cash to shareholders. \n So overall, we would expect that. We do feel good about the momentum in the business in terms of the connections with the customer, our seamless business processes on identifying ways to take cost out, so we can invest some of those cost savings in our associate wages, cost savings and the customer connection and other things. So -- and the business continues to generate good cash flow. \n Gary, it looks like you want to say something. If you look at most pieces, it would -- third quarter would have been better than second quarter. If you look at household trends, if you look at -- basket size would have been a little bit smaller but not significantly. We continue to see people -- premiumization during both the quarter. We continue to see people buying larger pack sizes on just about every category. So when you look at the puts and takes, I think there's as many puts and takes. Robbie, the only other thing I would add to Gary's comments, and it's implied throughout Gary's comments, but we have done a lot of people changes -- talent changes, both in terms of recruiting people from within the company but external as well outside of the industry that have skills that were different than traditional in our industry, which has been a huge help in both areas for us to think about things in new ways and for people to approach things in new ways as well. If you look at before COVID, the number of SKUs would be lower now than before, just because it's -- you don't have as much change time and things like that. There are selective areas where some of the national players haven't reintroduced some of the variety that we are introducing some of that variety in our own brands, and we introduced over 200 new SKUs in the quarter, and we would have an aggressive pipeline going forward. \n But overall, if you look at -- there's still continued SKU growth in natural organics, plant-based areas like that. And you will -- and if you think about like paper towels and paper goods and things like that, you would see fewer SKUs, just because the customers move to purchasing bigger-size packages. Gary, you want to... On promotions, we would always use our insights because different types of customers react different types of promotions. So we would aggressively use our insights to personalize promotions. A lot of that is one-on-one with a customer, either sending an old-fashioned mailing or electronically with e-mail or text or whatever. And it really depends on each customer and what do they test react to. Yes. On your second question, I'll answer it first, and you got to walk before you run. So right now, we're totally focused on making sure that the sheds open strongly, and we continue to maintain outstanding NPS scores, or net promoter scores, with our customers. And I am super proud of our team in Florida and Monroe, both in terms of how they continue to connect with the customer and continue to improve. \n If you look at basket size, the basket size continues to grow. And what we expected and what we believe is as the customers begin to trust the experience, begin to have good experiences, we get a higher share of their total spend. And that's what we're starting to see. \n And when you look at overall in Florida, one of the reasons why we announced the 2 additional facilities in Florida is obviously the connection and the growth that we are achieving. So far, we feel good about the opportunity in Florida. And as everybody knows, the population growth in Florida and the economic growth in Florida is just mind-boggling relative to an awful lot of the country. So it's an incredible opportunity for all grocery retailers in Florida. Obviously, the offering we have is unique in the market and very proud of what we're getting done there. Yes. If you look at customer behavior, I want to broaden it a little bit on -- relative to your question. We continue to see people focus on health.

We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and encourage you to stay safe. And as always, thank you for your interest in Kroger."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney shared this morning, Kroger delivered strong results in the third quarter, highlighting the flexibility of our business model in a dynamic operating environment. Our focus on execution, combined with our disciplined approach to balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and growth in our alternative profit business, is positioning us well for the future. \n Over time, our model has proven to be resilient during different economic scenarios, and this was true again during the third quarter as we grew the top and bottom lines while navigating higher product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply chain constraints. Our identical sales without fuel in the quarter returned to positive, growing 3.1% as we delivered for our customers across our seamless ecosystem, and customers, again, signaled higher food-at-home consumption is here to stay. Adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS both increased year-over-year and grew by compounded annual growth rates of 22% and 29%, respectively, versus 2019. \n Third quarter EPS was impacted by 2 unusual items that were excluded from our adjusted EPS result. First, we engaged in an annuity buyout and lump sum distribution transaction related to the company's consolidated retirement benefit plan which will reduce future administrative costs. This triggered a write-off of deferred losses and a nonrecurring noncash charge of $87 million on a pretax basis. This company pension plan is currently 100% funded as a result of previous action taken to freeze the plan and protect benefits for our associates. This transaction was fully funded by assets in the plan. The second unusual item was Kroger recording a nonrecurring benefit of $47 million or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily due to the favorable outcome of income tax audit examinations, covering multiple years. This amount is also excluded from the company's adjusted net earnings per diluted share result for the third quarter. \n I'll now provide more detail on our operating results in the quarter. On a 2-year stack basis, our identical sales without fuel increased 14%. We also saw digital sales increased 103% on a 2-year stack. As we have previously shared, we do not expect digital growth to be linear, especially as we cycle last year's sales spike and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again. The launch of several new digital offerings, which Rodney outlined earlier, in addition to the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against our growth targets for digital sales and profitability. We look forward to sharing more detail on our digital road map at the business update in March that Rob noted earlier on the call. With regard to digital profitability, we continue to make progress during the quarter and achieved our best cost to serve on record for pickup orders. \n Gross margin was 21.66% of sales for the third quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 41 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and continued price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits. Our investment was in line with expectations and fully funded by cost savings and OG&A improvement. \n Recognizing recent inflation trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a higher LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. This increase represents a $0.07 headwind to EPS in the quarter versus 2020. \n The operating, general and administrative rates decreased 49 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. This improvement was achieved even with continued investments in our associates and growth in our average hourly rate and reflects the outstanding work our associates are doing to execute cost-saving initiatives in a very dynamic environment. We remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings during 2021. \n Our alternative profit business had a record third quarter and remains on track to deliver the high end of our expected range of $100 million to $150 million of incremental operating profit in 2021. We saw increased strength in Kroger Personal Finance results during the quarter, and Kroger Precision Marketing introduced a new programmatic advertising marketplace to unleash first-party targeting and measurement capabilities, further highlighting our ability to differentiate in the advertising space. \n Fuel is also an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars, especially in times when fuel prices are high. During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the number of customers actively engaging in our fuel program. Gallons grew in the third quarter by 5%, outpacing market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.24 this quarter versus $2.15 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.42 compared to $0.37 in the same quarter in 2020. \n I'd now like to spend a couple of minutes providing some additional perspective on how we are proactively managing inflation. We are currently operating in a more volatile inflationary environment. And during the third quarter, Kroger saw higher product cost inflation in most categories. We are being disciplined in managing these increases. Our teams are doing an excellent job, working to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model by using our data and working closely with our suppliers. \n We are passing along higher cost to the customer where it makes sense to do so. In some key areas, we are choosing not to pass through cost increases and continuing to invest in value for the customer. We are investing where it matters most, using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization with the objective of winning long-term customer loyalty. We also believe our brands is an -- is an even more important differentiator for Kroger in an inflationary environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great value and great quality. \n Turning now to our financial strategy. Kroger is operating from a position of strength and continues to generate strong free cash flow as evidenced by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio hitting an all-time low of 1.68 in the third quarter. While we continue to see attractive opportunities to invest in the business, to widen our competitive moat and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth, our capital expenditures in 2021 are now expected to be below our original guidance range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This is because of delays in project implementations, primarily due to COVID-19-related supply challenges. \n Kroger continues to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $297 million of shares, and year-to-date, have repurchased $1 billion of shares. Since 2000, we have now returned more than $20 billion to shareholders via share repurchases at an average price of $16.45 per share. As of the end of the third quarter, $511 million remains outstanding under the current Board authorization announced on June 17, 2021. We look forward to sharing more about our plans for future deployment of excess cash to drive sustainable growth and create value for our shareholders at our business update in March. \n As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest meaningfully in our associates. In addition to the $350 million of hourly rate investment already planned this year, we have committed to further investments in the fourth quarter, which equates to an incremental $100 million on an annualized basis. \n During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in our Columbus and Mid-Atlantic divisions, covering over 4,500 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Lake Charles, Freeport, Dallas meat, Little Rock, Memphis, Portland and Denver. Our financial results are pressured by inefficiencies in health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local and international unions, which represent many of our associates about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. \n I'll now turn to our expectations for the remainder of 2021. Driven by the momentum in our third quarter results and sustained trends in food at home, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect identical sales without fuel for the full year to be between negative 0.4% and negative 0.2% and a 2-year identical sales stack of between 13.7% to 13.9%. There remain some uncertainties as we look ahead, and our guidance of positive ID sales excluding fuel of between 1.5% to 2.5% in the fourth quarter reflects this. We expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50. We expect our adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, reflecting a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of between 17% and 18.4%. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range for 2021 now equates to full year results, approximately in line with our 2020 results, despite cycling the unique COVID-19-related demand spike last year. \n Our guidance fully reflects the investments in our customers and associates I shared earlier, plus increased marketing to support the exciting new digital initiatives we launched in the third quarter. It also reflects the latest projection for LIFO. And because we recorded a LIFO credit in the fourth quarter last year, LIFO is now expected to be a $0.13 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter. Overall, we are very proud of our results, which are projected to be significantly ahead of where we originally guided for the year. \n In conclusion, Kroger is executing against its key financial and operational initiatives and continues to invest in strategic priorities that will deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. We believe our business is emerging stronger through the pandemic and through the investments we are making is well positioned to grow beyond 2021. \n I'll now turn it back to Rodney. Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Rob. Yes. I would say, Rob, obviously, when we guided at the second quarter, we said that the gross margin contraction could be similar to what we were seeing in Q2. And I would say the dynamics that are in place haven't changed dramatically. Obviously, it's a dynamic environment that we're managing, and our goal, as Rodney mentioned, is to continue to find sourcing benefit and savings to offset the cost increases where we see them and to pass on pricing where it makes sense but also to keep investing in the customer. And I'd say that we -- in Q2, we were doing that. In Q3, we've continued to do that. \n Supply chain would have been a similar sort of headwind in Q2 and Q3. I would say we were successful in mitigating some of the cost increases in shrink during the quarter, which helped during the quarter, although we still think shrink is a dynamic metric to manage based on some of the organized crime that we see in shrink. But overall, we were pleased with the progress in shrink during the quarter. And I think, for us, we kind of guided, while we never get into specific numbers on individual gross margin and OG&A metrics because, as Rodney mentioned there, our goal is to be dynamic in managing it, ensuring that we're delivering sustainably for our customers and growing loyalty while also being able to improve profitability over time by managing the different levers across selling growth rate, cost of goods savings, taking cost out of the business and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. \n So I think it's a dynamic environment we continue to manage. I think somewhere between the Q2 and Q3 range is where we think that we're operating right now. We think Q4 would likely be similar to what we've seen in Q2 and Q3. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are increasing some advertising in the fourth quarter to support the accelerated growth in some of those new initiatives. \n So I think, again, I wouldn't be guiding to a specific number, but in the range that you've seen in Q2 and Q3 is where we feel comfortable in managing the business and driving the right balance of sustainable growth for shareholders while continuing to win customer loyalty over time. No. I think you've covered it well. Well, I think you said it well, Rodney. I would just add where you were going. I think we're -- hopefully, we've been conveying very clearly, while we won't be getting into detailed guidance for 2022 because that's the first of March meeting, we've been trying to be clearing all of that communication, I think, around the confidence we have in the long-term prospects of the business, so not specific to '22, but thinking as we're continuing to build the business from the base that we've established through COVID that the opportunity to grow and deliver on that TSR commitment that Rodney mentioned. And specifically, we do believe that some of the food-at-home trends that we've talked a lot about. We've said for some time and continue to believe that data shows that a number of those changes will be structural in nature, and we'll continue to see sustained trends in food at home. \n I think if you look at our performance over the last 2 years that Rodney was alluding to some of the individual drivers, but I think it's demonstrated in our mind the confidence in the value creation model that we're creating, the balance in our model to be able to drive sustainable growth. And the alternative profit stream is continuing to grow at double digits off a higher base. So certainly, I would endorse Rodney's comment more broadly around that commitment to TSR over time. But obviously, we'll get into more details on 2022 in March. Maybe just to add, Rodney. Yes, Simeon, I mean, the trends were pretty consistent through the quarter in Q3. They got slightly better as the quarter went on, and we would be trending at the top end of the range that we shared in the quarter-to-date so far, top end of the range that we shared for guidance for Q4. And if you look at the trend so far in this quarter, I would say that the quarter would have started a little bit slower because of -- we were cycling in that week before Thanksgiving a fairly large spike in consumer behavior that I think started to signal maybe a potential increase in cases this time last year, and then Thanksgiving was very strong. We were very pleased with the results over the Thanksgiving week itself. \n I think some of the questions in our mind as we look towards Q4 that are some of the reasons that we guided to some of the uncertainties, it's hard to predict exactly what will happen with government stimulus dollars in the market, particularly at the state level. That's kind of really hard to get over the skin of what will happen in individual states around ongoing funding. We obviously know there are some continued supply chain challenges around product availability in certain categories, and that's getting better gradually but still has certainly some challenges in the market. And it will be those kind of things that, for us, would be the puts and takes in how strong Q4 plays out in our mind. Sure. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes. We're really proud of the team's work in those areas, as you mentioned. It started out at the beginning of Restock Kroger. There is a sort of let's grab the opportunities that are immediately in front of us, and I think it's really become a core competency within the organization to drive sustainable savings in our model. \n On the sourcing side, I think I would describe it across a number of different areas. You start with how do you make sure you're consolidating all the buying in the right places, so you can maximize the data and knowledge and use our own experiences from the cost of commodities and the fact we manufacture many of our products so that we're getting smarter and more effective in how we buy. It's evolved into product design and packaging design and how do you really optimize the value while not compromising on quality for the customer, so continuing to drive value in those areas. It's extended to the GPO partnership that we created with Walgreens and looking at how can you consolidate opportunities and best thinking there as well. \n So it continues to evolve for us, and the team is doing a great job in finding those opportunities to maximize savings. And we would expect that to be a continued opportunity for us because we keep identifying new innovative ways to ensure that we're designing for value and maximizing opportunities to be more efficient.\n On the sort of the OG&A side of things, that's across a number of different areas as well. So it would include using technology and automation to reduce shrink and waste in the business, to improve on some of those activities in the store and our operations that are very manual and don't really maximize the value that our great associates can deliver for customers, so taking that non-value-added work out wherever we can to allow our associates to focus on the customer. It includes automating our ordering and production planning-type processes. \n One of the big ones, of course, this year that we think would expect to be a tailwind into next year as well for every dollar that we can capture this year would be taking cost out of our digital cost to serve. So we've invested significant labor over the years in building that digital ecosystem, and we'd expect to continue to grow that business, of course. But if we can take out -- if we can improve efficiency on that $10 billion digital business, it creates not just a saving on the next new sale, but it creates a saving on that baseline $10 billion business as well. \n And then finally, I would say we've taken the opportunity to use things like the learnings through COVID on things like administrative costs and where are there areas you can actually work more efficiently and operate in more of a hybrid environment to take cost out of the model as well. \n So I hope that gives you an idea of the way it's kind of really become embedded more in the business, and we certainly would expect as part of our overall TSR growth model to be continuing to take costs to be able to fund investments in our average hourly rate for associates, to be able to invest in pricing and value for the customer while at the same time growing shareholder returns. Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, Spencer. As we mentioned, we're kind of not really providing sort of an outlook for 2022 at this point around how we think about sales and investments overall. We'll be doing that, for sure, as we get to the March meeting and sharing our Q4 results. \n I think, really, I would pivot back to some of the comments that we made earlier around we think very much of it from the perspective of in all operating environments, Kroger has been able to demonstrate our ability to navigate through those situations. And it really comes back to what we were talking about earlier around ensuring that we understand the customer better than anybody, using our data, our targeting, our promotional activity and our personalized pricing, and of course, where the pricing structure of product starts to change, really ensuring that customers see the value in our own brand products because of the great quality and value that they offer in combination. And during times of high inflation and certainly in times of economic challenge, we found that Kroger has performed very well, and we've seen customers pivot to some of those opportunities based on the way we can communicate and connect customers with those strategies. \n So I think from our perspective, we're very much managing the business dynamically to ensure that we can deliver for the customer, but at the same time, deliver on our TSR commitments in the way that we talked about earlier in the conversation. And the repeat usage, Rodney, is higher than we expected, right, than net promoter score. Yes. Thanks, John. Obviously, we are really proud of the business performance, and it has demonstrated strength in the overall model and the position that we're in, as we said in the prepared comments. I would say our overall capital allocation strategy is unchanged, that we start with where are the opportunities to invest in capital in the business to drive sustainable growth. We're obviously in a great position around maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, and we've been able to make some good progress on chipping away at the pension funding from an overall sort of debt and potential liability there as well. \n This year, of course, we've been very committed to continuing to return cash to shareholders with the $1 billion, so far, on buybacks and the 17% increase in the dividend that we announced earlier in the year. So I think we've been very consistent with that plan so far. \n We do think that in the short term, it's important to maintain some flexibility, recognizing some of the uncertainty in the market that we've all talked about, that we're all navigating through at the moment. That being said, within those principles, we do think it's important, and we've been very committed, as you know, as a company, to being very disciplined with cash flow and deploying it to either grow the business or return to shareholders. \n So as we head towards 2022 and as we move towards the March planning meeting and the business update meeting that Rob shared, we'd certainly expect to share more color of how we're thinking about the excess cash and some of the opportunities we're exploring there."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  Please note this event is being recorded.  \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.  \n Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. This morning, we released a presentation to accompany our call today, which can be found on our Investor Relations web page at ir.kroger.com. We encourage you to refer to these materials as Rodney and Gary will make references to the presentation throughout the call. During our prepared remarks, we will share our fourth quarter and full year results. We will update you on the progress  our team has made since our Investor Day last year on our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy. We look forward to returning to a full Investor Day in 2024, where we expect to share detailed plans for how we will achieve synergies and maximize shareholder value from our merger with Albertsons.  \n After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up question, if necessary.\n I will now turn the call over to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by sharing how incredibly optimistic I am about Kroger's future. Our performance last year demonstrates how Kroger is consistently delivering for our customers, our associates and our communities and by doing so, creating value for our shareholders. Since announcing our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy at our 2020 Investor Day, we have made tremendous progress against our commitments.  \n As you will see from the chart on Slide 6 of the presentation deck Rob mentioned, we are delivering a fresh, affordable and seamless shopping experience for our customers with 0 compromise on value, quality, selection or convenience. We are advancing our purpose to feed the human spirit by significantly increasing associate wages and uplifting our communities. And we are delivering on our financial commitments through our strong resilient value creation model. With this strategy, we exceeded our financial goals and delivered attractive total shareholder returns during the past 2 years.  \n In 2022, customer preferences shifted in response to inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers were looking for more ways to stretch their budget. The gap between food at home and food away from home spending grew in the fourth quarter as more customers gravitated toward affordable meal solutions that restaurants simply can't provide. Our research shows that cooking at home is 3 to 4x less expensive than dining out. And as Kroger was there for our customers, innovating quickly to meet their needs and wants, our nimble and customer-focused approach helped us deliver strong results in 2022, leading to total household growth and enhanced customer loyalty. We saw an especially strong response in our higher income households as this segment grew by 1.1 million households, further illustrating the resiliency in our model and strong value proposition we offer customers across all segments.  \n Gary will get into the specific details of our 2022 financial results and outlook for 2023 a little later. Before doing so, I'd like to spend some time reviewing how each pillar of our go-to-market strategy provided meaningful and measurable customer benefits last year and how we will accelerate those benefits in 2023. The foundation of our go-to-market strategy is fresh, our brands, personalization and seamless. By delivering on these 4 pillars, our customers win and Kroger attracts new and more loyal customers. At the center of our go-to-market strategy is a superior customer experience. We deliver that by consistently providing customers a full, fresh and friendly experience.  \n Kroger continued to demonstrate operational excellence in 2022 as we saw improvements in all 3 metrics. We believe our go-to-market strategy is creating a unique value -- customer value proposition designed to perform in many economic environments. We will continue to invest in our pillars and the customer experience to differentiate the value we offer.  \n First, leading with fresh. As an important influence on where customers shop, we are constantly improving how we bring even fresher food to our stores and e-commerce experience. Our end-to-end fresh initiative is changing the way our teams deliver on our commitment to freshness and we are incredibly pleased with this success. In 2022, more than 1,400 stores implemented the end-to-end produce solution, driving measurable increases in both fresh and total store sales. In 2023, we will continue innovating the fresh experience to drive customer satisfaction and improve our product mix. We continue to improve inventory management tools, strengthen our supply chain to deliver additional days of freshness and enhance our offerings to meet customer demand.  \n As a reminder, our merger with Home Chef brought significant capabilities in in-store and restaurant quality meal solutions. We will be expanding our home chef production facilities to meet this growing customer need.  \n Next, Our Brands. The Our Brands portfolio allows us to offer exciting products at great value while driving incremental sales and improving margins. Our Brand's quality and value proposition is especially important when inflation is affecting so many of our customers' lives. To meet the needs of customers on a budget, we launched a new opening price point product line called Smart Way. By consolidating and simplifying several brands into one, we are making it easier for customers while creating a point of differentiation across the full portfolio. We will continue expanding Our Brands to more categories with innovative product offerings. Our goal is to help every customer find high-quality, affordable products they love from pantry staples to fresh food to ready-to-heat restaurant quality meals.  \n Now I'll move to personalization. Our data science teams are using predictive science to serve customers the right products at the right time and at the best value. Because we know our customers so well, we were able to provide recommendations to start their baskets and deliver personalized offers on the products most important to them, saving them time and money and making their lives easier. In return, our customers reward us with their trust and loyalty, consistently ranking us among the best at being able to offer personalized savings and solutions that meet their needs.  \n In 2022, we grew loyalty as our customers more deeply engaged with personalized coupons and fuel rewards. As customers look for more ways to save, digital coupon engagement hit an all-time high during the year. Our combined paper and digital coupons helped save our customers more than $1.4 billion on products they need and want. That's on top of our everyday promotions and all the other value we offer.  \n To provide even more value, we launched Boost, the industry's most affordable membership nationwide in July. Early results are exceeding our expectations with incremental engagement and overall household spend. We are evolving Boost with new benefits to further broaden its appeal and create additional customer value. In 2023, we will make significant investments to build out our personalization capabilities, including increasing the use of real-time data to predict customer needs, which will support sales growth during the next 3 years.  \n Finally, turning to Seamless. Seamless is growing in importance among our customers, and we expect it will be a significant growth driver over the next several years. We have built a digital platform that offers a seamless shopping experience with 0 compromise, allowing customers to shift effortlessly between store, pickup and delivery solutions.  \n As you'll see on Slide 12, our combination of stores and dedicated fulfillment centers positions Kroger to serve all customer trips from in-stock shopping to rapid delivery on needed now items to large stock up orders. Despite the easing of pandemic-related shopping behaviors that led to a significant increase in online shopping, more and more customers are incorporating e-commerce into their daily permanent routines, recognizing the value and convenience online shopping offers. We expect digital sales will continue to grow at a faster pace than overall food at home sales and believe Kroger is well positioned to deliver double-digit growth in over the next 3 years.  \n As we work to become the most trusted online grocery destination, we are focused on 4 key areas that will position us to deliver that growth. We start by providing a compelling Kroger owned digital destination, where we offer customers exceptional value, personalization and freshness in a single, easy-to-use online experience. Second, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment, driving trust and loyalty by exceeding expectations for quality and freshness. Our delivery approach is unique in the fact that we have a large store network conveniently located close to our customers and large dedicated fulfillment centers designed efficiently to pick large orders. Our dedicated fulfillment centers provide the most reliable experience, the highest in-stock levels, best on-time delivery and one-of-a-kind white glove experience with industry-leading Net Promoter Scores.  \n Kroger delivery customers are more engaged across our entire ecosystem, spending more and shopping with us more often. Looking ahead, we will continue to learn through our customer fulfillment network with a focus on driving profitability and efficiencies to ensure that we are well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth while delighting our customers.  \n Next, we are focused on reaching new customers and adding more shopping occasions. Our delivery network allows us to offer enhanced service to new customers, and we will also grow our share of wallet by increasing the number of orders customers place with us. Solutions like Kroger Delivery Now enabled by our vast network of conveniently located stores can connect customers to fresh groceries and household essentials in as little as 30 minutes. This seamless ecosystem makes any shopping experience simple for our customers.  \n Finally, we are driving our profit flywheel and improving margins by reducing our digital cost to serve and growing our alternative profit streams. To accomplish this goal, we are lowering fulfillment costs, building the density of demand and last mile routing, engaging directly with our third-party vendors and growing digital retail media.  \n Now let me share how we are accelerating growth in our model through alternative profits. During the last several years, we invested heavily in technology to transform our business and enter new high-growth and high-return businesses. These businesses contribute meaningfully to our results with alternative profit businesses achieving $1.2 billion in operating profit in 2022. Kroger Precision Marketing is one of our fastest-growing businesses and is well positioned to win within the U.S. retail media landscape, which is projected to be a $55 billion industry by 2024. What makes our retail media business special is our ability to help brands achieve a greater return on their media investment.  \n For the fifth year in a row, KPM was recognized as a leader in the retail media space by the Path to Purchase Institute, which collects feedback from those closest to the retail media networks and accessing their effectiveness. KPM was recognized as a leader for many of its capabilities, including maintaining its leadership in targeting and measurement capabilities, a testament to the strength of our unique product offerings and the insights we bring to this emerging landscape. Our associates enable our success, and we are committed to investing in theirs.  \n To remain an employer of choice, we support our associates development and holistic well-being. We provide our associates with the tools they need to grow their careers that they want at all stages. In 2022, Kroger was named as a Best Place to Work in IT for the fifth consecutive year and a best place to work for disability inclusion for the third year. We also continue to support our associates through investments in wages and comprehensive benefits. In 2022, we raised our average hourly rates by more than 6% and has now invested an incremental $1.9 billion in associate wages since 2018. Our average hourly rate is now more than $18 and more than $23 when you include comprehensive benefits. We are committed to sustainably increasing associate wages and plan to invest more than $770 million in associates in 2023. We value and respect our associates and investing in their success is just one way we demonstrate that.  \n We take seriously our role in helping to create a healthier and thriving neighborhoods across the country. The centerpiece of our efforts is Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan, an industry-leading commitment to build communities free from hunger and waste. Since launching Zero Hunger | Zero Waste, we have made continual progress toward our goals. We have directed more than $1.65 billion in food and funds to help end hunger, including donating more than 2.3 billion meals. We are making progress on our carbon emissions reduction plan and our brand's sustainable packaging goal. I'm especially proud of our incredible associates who helped us reach a key milestone this year with 100% execution of our surplus food rescue programs across each and every store across the company.  \n Looking ahead, we will continue to focus our efforts on our ambitious goal of ending hunger in our communities and eliminating waste, especially food waste throughout the company.  In summary, our proven go-to-market strategy led to enhanced loyalty and household growth as we help customers manage the effect of inflation in 2022. We are well positioned to sustain our momentum into 2023.  \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our results and expectations for 2023. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into our 2022 results and sharing our outlook for 2023, I'd like to take a step back and remind you how Kroger's value creation model is enabling the company to deliver sustainable value for our shareholders. We believe our value creation model has been a key to delivering consistently strong results over the past 4 years and is positioning Kroger for growth in years to come.  \n The go-to-market strategy that Rodney outlined earlier is the foundation of our model. Over recent years, we have invested significantly in our people, our customers and technology to create a leading omnichannel position in food retail. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we win customers in our core supermarket business, including health and fuel and drive significant customer traffic and data into our ecosystem. This, in turn, allows us to deploy our investments in technology and 84.51\u00b0 to deliver even greater value for customers and create new high-growth, high-margin alternative profit businesses.  \n The value generated from these businesses enables us to reinvest back into our supermarkets and drive further store and digital traffic, creating a flywheel effect. We are evolving from a traditional food retailer into a more diverse food first business that we believe can deliver sustainable future growth and succeed in a variety of operating environments.  \n As a reminder, since introducing this model in 2019, we have achieved consistent returns for our shareholders that have significantly exceeded our TSR commitment of 8% to 11%.  As you can see in the table on Slide 19, over the past 3 years, Kroger has achieved more than 19% compounded annual growth rate in adjusted FIFO net operating profit and approximately 25% compounded annual growth rate in adjusted EPS. Over this same time period, we generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $9.7 billion and have returned a total of nearly $5.8 billion to investors via dividends and buybacks.  \n Overall, we have delivered nearly 3x the expected return from our TSR model over this 3-year period. Importantly, at the same time, we continue to invest in the business to support future growth. This included improving our price position relative to key competitors since the start of the pandemic, increasing associate wages and benefits by 34% since 2018 and increasing the amount of capital investments allocated to technology and digital capabilities to enable top line growth and margin expansion.  \n Our strong performance and progress with our model in recent years also gave us the financial flexibility and confidence to announce our proposed merger with Albertsons. Upon closing, which is anticipated to be in early 2024, we believe the merger will significantly accelerate our go-to-market strategy and deliver TSR well above our stand-alone model during the first 4 years post close.  \n I'll now walk through our full year 2022 financial results. Kroger delivered adjusted EPS of $4.23 per diluted share, an increase of 15%. We achieved identical sales, excluding fuel of 5.6%. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 9 basis points. This reflects the outstanding work of our merchandising and sourcing teams who are extremely effective in managing higher product cost inflation while maintaining competitive prices and helping customers manage their budgets. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 19 basis points, reflecting sales leverage and cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by planned investments in associates. And I'm delighted to say for the fifth consecutive year, we delivered cost savings of $1 billion in 2022. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $5.1 billion, an increase of 18% from last year. And the LIFO charge for the full year was $626 million compared to $197 million in 2021.  \n Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.99 for the quarter, an increase of almost 9%. We saw continued momentum in our identical sales without fuel of 6.2%. Underlying growth would have been 6.7% after adjusting for the effect of Express Scripts. Our Brands contributed another strong quarter with identical sales of 10.1%, reflecting the growing importance to customers of these exclusive to Kroger products. And digital sales also accelerated during the quarter, up 12%, led by 22% growth in Delivery Solutions. Kroger's FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel decreased 1 basis point and the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items decreased 56 basis points.  \n Fuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition. Our loyalty program, which can save customers up to $1.25 per gallon has been one of the many ways we have helped customers stretch their dollars over the past year and contributed to our gallon sales outpacing the industry during the quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $3.39 compared to $3.30 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.51 compared to $0.44 in the same quarter last year.  \n Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.27 billion, a year-over-year increase of 26%. And the LIFO charge was $234 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting sustained higher product cost inflation, particularly in grocery. This compares to a charge of only $20 million in Q4 last year.  \n Included in our fourth quarter results was a $164 million goodwill and fixed asset impairment charge related to Vitacost.com. The talent and capabilities gained through the merger with Vitacost in 2014 have been key to advancing Kroger's digital platform and growing our digital business to more than $10 billion in annual sales. As our digital strategy has evolved, our primary focus looking forward will be to effectively utilize Kroger store pickup and delivery capabilities, and this reprioritization resulted in the impairment charge. Vitacost.com will continue to operate as an online platform, providing great value, natural, organic and eco-friendly products for our customers.  \n Adjusted free cash flow for the year came in $800 million lower than anticipated. This was entirely due to movements in working capital towards the end of the year. The cause was a combination of factors including higher inflation affecting inventory, some forward buying to protect margins and timing of accounts payable and third-party receivable payments around the year-end. As shared last quarter, we feel comfortable with our overall level of mix of inventory, which is higher due to heightened levels of inflation and in-stocks returning to pre-pandemic levels.  \n Looking over a 5-year time horizon and smoothing the volatility in working capital experience during the pandemic, we have seen an underlying benefit from working capital over this time period, and we would expect to see further improvement going forward. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. And as shared in our guidance this morning, expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2023.  \n Turning now to financial strategy and capital allocation. We will continue to be disciplined with our capital investments, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for our shareholders. As you saw in our guidance this morning, we are anticipating capital investments of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion this year, which is consistent with our long-range TSR model. Our priorities for 2023 are aligned with our value creation model and are expected to drive future sales growth and margin expansion.  \n To drive sales, our focus is on enhancing our store and digital ecosystem. We apply a data-driven approach to make decisions on a store-by-store basis, prioritizing store formats and locations with the highest growth potential. Additionally, we are continually enhancing our seamless experience including investing in technology to improve the customer proposition and augmenting personalization, which will, in turn, create additional alternative profit opportunities. We continue to invest in areas of the business that will drive operating margin expansion, including enhancements to our supply chain capabilities. These investments help improve margins and differentiate our fresh offering.  \n And finally, an essential element of our value creation model has been our ability to take cost out of our business. We remain focused on eliminating waste in areas that did not affect the customer experience and we are making investments in technology to improve store productivity, lower digital fulfillment costs and reduce waste and shrink. These improvements will drive an incremental $1 billion of cost savings in 2023, which would mark our sixth year in a row of delivering $1 billion of savings.  \n In closing, I'd like to share some additional color on our expectations for 2023. While there is still uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, our go-to-market strategy is resonating with customers, and we believe our successful value creation model positions us well to navigate evolving market conditions.  \n Before I go into the details of our 2023 guidance, there are a couple of unusual factors that I'd like to highlight. First, Kroger's decision to terminate our agreement with Express Groups in December of 2022 is expected to have a negative impact of 150 basis points on identical sales without fuel. This decision is not expected to have a material effect on profitability.  \n Second, 2023 will include a 53rd week. We expect the effect of this extra week at approximately $0.15 to our adjusted net earnings per diluted share for the year. With that important context, we expect to achieve identical sales without fuel of 1% to 2% in 2023. Excluding the effect of Express Scripts, our underlying identical sales without fuel growth is expected to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. We expect to achieve adjusted FIFO operating profit of between $5 billion and $5.2 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of between $4.45 and $4.60, including the expected benefit of the 53rd week.  \n We expect to grow revenue by continuing to invest in our customers through competitive pricing and personalization and providing fresh products and a better shopping experience across our store and digital ecosystem. We will fund investments in gross margin in 2023 by improving our product mix as we accelerate momentum with our Fresh and Our Brands initiatives and by growing our alternative profit businesses.  \n As Rodney mentioned earlier, we will also continue to invest significantly in associate wages and this will be funded by our planned cost-saving initiatives. While we believe fuel margins will remain structurally higher than historical averages, fuel profitability is expected to be a headwind to our model in 2023 as we lap historic fuel margins from last year. Our 2023 guidance assumes a LIFO charge of between $300 million to $350 million as a result of lower product cost inflation compared to 2022. While this amount is well above historical levels, LIFO is expected to be a year-over-year tailwind and should more than offset lower fuel profitability.  \n In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect identical sales without fuel to be above the top end of our guidance range in the first half of the year as we continue to experience heightened levels of inflation. In the second half of the year, we expect identical sales without fuel to be at or slightly below the bottom end of our range as we expect inflation to taper later in the year. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share in quarter 1 will be slightly negative year-over-year as we cycle 22% growth in EPS from Q1 last year. Quarter 2 and quarter 3 are expected to be within our annual guidance range and quarter 4 is expected to be above our guidance range as we cycle the higher LIFO charge in '22 and benefit from the 53rd week.  \n As you know from Rodney and myself this morning, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and the investments that we have made in our go-to-market strategy provide exciting opportunities for future growth. Our team is energized by these opportunities and we believe Kroger is well positioned to continue to deliver attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders.  \n I'll now turn the call back over to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we open up the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with Albertsons. During the past few months, we've spent time getting to know Vivek and the Albertsons leadership team. We are incredibly impressed with their talent, culture and commitment to their customers and communities. We look forward to bringing together our 2 highly complementary organizations to provide customers with lower prices and more choices while realizing the long-term value we expect this merger will deliver.  \n We are working cooperatively with regulators responding to the Federal Trade Commission's second request and in discussions about the transaction, while also working to identify potential buyers for the stores, we expect to divest to obtain clearance for the transaction. We are pleased with the level of interest received thus far, and we'll work towards finding a solution that benefits all stakeholders. We remain on track to close the transaction in early 2024.  \n During the quarter, we launched our integration planning efforts with the goal of preparing for a seamless cultural and operational integration. We expect to create customer benefits beginning day 1 post close. The integration team is developing work streams with clear objectives and milestones to deliver value for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. We are pleased with the progress we've made to date, and we'll continue to provide updates as we have them.  \n We achieved exceptional results in 2022, building on our record years in 2020 and 2021, and we exceeded our commitments in our Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital strategy. Our folks strategy is focusing on our customers, our associates and our communities is working. Our customers are telling us that we're doing a better job serving their needs. We continue to improve our associate wages and comprehensive benefits with a 34% increase in the last 5 years. And we are helping to create healthier thriving communities through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste work. We believe our momentum is sustainable and will only accelerate upon the completion of our pending merger with Albertsons.  \n With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. \nJohn Heinbockel: Rodney, I wanted to start with since it's the beginning of a new year. As you guys think about your consumer deciles, quartiles, however you look at it, what's the wallet share opportunity right, maybe from the average consumer to your best, most loyal consumer. And where is the -- when you do sort of a gap analysis, where is the gap? Is it fresh? Where are the biggest pockets, right, where the average consumer is not spending as much as the most loyal. \nW. McMullen: And John, thanks. I love the question. And we always look at it slightly different because we look at the opportunity is all the business. And even in places where we over-index, there's still a lot of opportunity. Customers that are most loyal to us will still spend 30% to 50% of their spending somewhere other than Kroger. And that's an opportunity for us to improve our position. When you look at Fresh, we start off with a higher share of Fresh than we do in the other parts. But it's an area where we're meaningfully better than our competitors. So our ability and focus on growing our business is to really -- what we find is full Fresh and friendly resonates with all customer types, and we do it in a way where there's 0 compromise.  \n So a customer on a budget can get great value from Our Brands. They can save 7% to 10% by buying Our Brands versus national brand. If you look at our Home Chef and products related to that, a customer can get a meal for 1/3 to 1/4 of what it costs going out. So it's really all of those together. And our opportunity -- our sweet spot is always the customer that likes a good value for the money and Fresh is incredibly important and friendly is incredibly important. That's our sweet spot where we connect the best and that is a growing area across the U.S., and we operate in many markets that are growing as well. So for us, that's really our sweet spot and our opportunity and our strategy is oriented around that. And then technology just provides the support for that make it easier for the customer. \nJohn Heinbockel: Great. Maybe secondly, right, if you look at the Express Scripts impact, so how much of that is pharmacy versus none, right? And I know you guys have always said pharmacy customers among the most loyal customers. How do you think about losing trips, right, because of this and then maybe using right, your data, okay, we know who -- I think you know who the Express Scripts customers were. We can do incremental outreach to make sure we don't lose trips with those particular households. \nW. McMullen: If you look the numbers that Gary provided by far, the majority of that's pharmacy. Our teams are doing great work on using our discount cards to be able to help customers identify other alternatives. And in fact, in many cases, they're saving money. We're also going directly with some other companies to provide the benefit rather than going through a PBM. So by far, the majority of the estimate that Gary provided is pharmacy. And we're using the things that you said to make sure that we don't lose that customer connection and we don't lose the trip to the grocery store.  \n I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? \nGary Millerchip: I think you said it well, Rodney.  I think that John described it, but work the team has done around using our data and personalization to make sure we're protecting the customer. We think it's working. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Thanks for all the color. A question for you to start. Rodney, just kind of big picture. We're coming off of an inflationary cycle that really none of us have ever sort of seen before. And obviously, there are a lot of implications associated with that. But as you look forward into '23 and sort of thought about providing guidance, how do you think the industry is going to evolve off of the heels of that? Meaning what's the level of inflation that you've embedded within your ID guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% ex Express.\n How do you think about like the promotional backdrop and how that changes? Are you happy with your underlying tonnage for instance or volume given what's happened with pricing and what we've seen with comps at some like value players like Walmart, et cetera. Just kind of curious, is that how all of that played into the way you're thinking about guidance? \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at inflation overall, we would expect inflation to be higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year and the quarterly insights that Gary provided really reflected that. If you look at the thing that we feel really good about, and I shared specifics on the prepared comments, the higher income customer is really resonating with our value proposition, and we're having meaningful increases there in terms of that customer.  \n And one of the things I always think it's important for people to realize is the profitability of that customer is higher as well because they shop for the full mix of our stores and they would be buying more produce in Fresh departments and Deli bakery, which is driving some of that profitability shift. So when you look at overall, we feel really good on how we're connecting with our customers. We feel really good at how we're improving on Fresh. And when you look at the share that we're getting with the customer that really focuses on that, we feel good about. When you look at it overall, we're always striving to do better. And I feel good about the progress we're making. We're excited about the opportunities we have in front of us, and we still think we can continue to do better.  In terms of specifics on inflation, Gary, I'll let you share the specific inflation assumption because it's pretty -- during the year, it's obviously pretty wide range. \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Ed. From an inflation perspective, what we're seeing at the moment is that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, inflation has really sort of stabilized. And what we're starting to see is in the Fresh categories, sort of deceleration of inflation, but grocery is -- has remained pretty stubborn in terms of the levels there.  \n So we're assuming, as Rodney mentioned, in the first half of the year that a gradual decline, probably grocery remaining fairly stubborn where it is today, but some of the Fresh categories continuing to show some deceleration. And then we're expecting sort of towards the end of the year that we get to sort of between low and mid-single-digit inflation level rates about sort of 4% to 5% would be our assumption around where we think inflation starts to come down to in the way that we build our assumptions for the year. And obviously, Our Brand... \nEdward Kelly: Okay, just a quick followup... \nGary Millerchip: Go ahead, Ed. \nEdward Kelly: Got you. Just a quick follow-up, Gary. The FIFO gross margin outlook for '23. I think there is a decent -- I mean, it seems like there's a decent impact associated with Express, given there's no P&L impact of losing the comp. Just how are you thinking about FIFO gross margin ex fuel in '23? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. As you know, we generally don't get into a ton of specific guidance. But I would say, in general, we're thinking and the way we built our model is very much in balance and consistent with what we delivered in 2022 in terms of -- when you think about gross margin, we'll be continuing to invest in the customer in key areas of value whatever important to them, whether that's pricing, promotions continuing to roll out Boost, which creates a short-term headwind as you build the loyalty of the customer and get the incremental value over a longer period of time.  \n We believe that there'll be some continued meaningful tailwinds in our gross margin rate as we continue to execute on our go-to-market strategy. So thinking about alternative profit streams. The work I mentioned in my prepared remarks about continuing to see improvement in Our Brands penetration, which is helpful to gross margin. And so we overall, think it's going to be a pretty balanced year. There's an awful lot going in there as we're investing in the customer, investing in the experience. But as our model is now kind of reaching more of a rhythm and maturity of delivering on those gross margin improvements that we're able to balance those things.  \n I would say from an Express Scripts point of view and some of the other work that we've done around Kroger Specialty Pharmacy are making sure that we're really focusing on profitable growth in our health and wellness business that those probably create a call it, a sort of 10 basis point tailwind in gross margin, but a 10 basis point headwind in OG&A. It's kind of net, net neutral in terms of the operating profit impact, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, but it will change the optics a bit just because the sort of pulling those sales numbers out of our overall business model. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question, it's a little similar to Ed's question. If you look at the FIFO EBIT guided for 2023, essentially, call it, flattish. I'm just rounding relative to '22. If you divide the business up into core, I don't know alternative and maybe gas as profit pools, and I don't know if those would be the right 3, the big ones to focus on. Can you give us a sense of the movement within getting to that flat -- roughly flat for EBIT year-over-year? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think what I'd probably say, Simeon, as I think about it, the sort of 3 bigger picture moving parts that I tried to sort of tee up the overall guidance with as well. So I think about it as the 53rd week adding, call it, $0.15 of earnings per share. So that's helping with -- think of $0.01 of about $9 million to $10 million. So I think if it's like $150 million tailwind from the 53rd week. I think of gas, so fuel being a headwind of -- in the sort of $200 million to $250 million range.  \n And then I would think of the sort of core supermarket business is really sort of continuing to grow year-over-year. So the gap is more than offsetting the impact of the 53rd week.  The core supermarket business sort of executing on our value creation model, as I mentioned. So underlying sales growth in that 2.5% to 3.5% growth because the Express Scripts business really hasn't contribute to the bottom line, continuing to invest in the customer, continuing to execute on our plans around driving cost out of the business and improving mix and those things net overall getting us to a slight improvement.  And I'll probably -- we won't get into the specifics obviously of breaking down the individual pieces, but we really categorize all profit as part of the overall ecosystem because we don't have media revenue unless we're driving the digital supermarket business. So we very much look at it as a total ecosystem. \nSimeon Gutman: Right. And then as a follow-up on the backdrop regarding pricing inflation, it seems like the backdrop is maybe more oligopolistic than one would have thought, not that it's not competitive out there, but in terms of price and wondering what that's a function of and maybe what could disrupt it? Is that a fair assessment? \nW. McMullen: We would certainly describe it and look at it different than that. And we've invested in pricing -- I'm trying to remember for the last 20 years or so every single year and would expect to continue to do that. And we fund that through process change, identifying other things to get costs out. And an awful lot of our promotions are much more directed personalized to the customer. So it's not what you see when you go to a store to look on a shelf because we provide a significant higher percentage of our value to our customers through fuel rewards and personalized offers that are connected one-on-one from -- in using technology and digital so that each person is individual. \n So we would certainly not describe it that way. And we view it -- every year is incredibly competitive, and everybody is working hard to do a better job and the customer gets the benefit of that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Between the comments that you had indicated at the early start of the call, where you're working on the profitability of your digital business, along with what it sounds like a slowdown in the rollout of your Ocado shed this year, have you evolved your thinking on the long-term profitability of digital sales for Kroger because you had previously indicated that you expected the incremental margin on an incremental dollar of sales to be at or above an in-store dollar of incremental sales. \nW. McMullen: When you look at our digital business long term, we wouldn't see the profitability be any difference in this supermarket when you look at it over a longer period of time. And if you look, what we find is a customer when they move online, they actually after a year engage with us more in store than before. So what we're really focused on is having an ecosystem where the customer thinks food, they think Kroger. And what we're finding is the customer routinely moves back and forth between the different channels. \n If you look at each piece of it, every single day, you're working to figure out ways to improve processes and take costs out. And then on top of it, obviously, retail media is an important part of the driver. So when you look at it long term, we really see no change in the opportunity and potential. We're incredibly excited and everything that we see, we think it will be more important in 3 years, 5 years, 10 years to have where the customer engage with us through multiple ways. And the digital channel is a critical part of that, and we find the customer engages with us digitally, even when they don't shop digitally. So for us, we see it as exciting as we did before. We don't see the long-term profitability being different. And we're working continually in terms of both internally and with our partners on how to improve processes. \nGary Millerchip: Maybe just to add, Rodney -- Michael, to the sort of short-term answer to Rodney's long-term perspective, I would say that we are seeing the benefits flow through in the profitability that we talked about on prior investor meetings. So if you think about our existing digital business today, pick up through the store delivery, what we're seeing is the cost to serve. We had our best ever quarter for the cost to serve a digital order in the Q4 of 2022. \n Rodney mentioned media, the amount of media revenue we generate per digital transaction continues to grow. So those are 2 of the big drivers that we expect to drive digital profitability, and we continue to see improvements in '22, and we expect improvements in '23 that were actually part of the tailwind in the financial model I described earlier. So we remain on that path and we are making good progress. \nMichael Lasser: And Gary, just to clarify that, then why slow the rollout of the Ocado sheds? And my second question just at this time. To get to the slightly below the low end of the range for ID sales by the end of the year with still low to mid-single-digit inflation, do you assume that there's going to be a unit erosion by the end of the year as -- I don't need to tell you guys, groceries are expensive and in a tough economic environment that may get worse by the end of the year. The consumer may be pulling back even further, and we just want to make sure that you factored in some conservatism into your outlook. \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll try and be brief on those 2. So I think just to clarify on the first part of the question, I was describing the majority of our digital business today. So think about pickup through the stores, think about the work that we're doing in delivery to customers today. And when we share that doubling our digital profitability, that was based on those metrics. And so how do we improve the cost to serve, how do we improve digital media revenue. \n On the customer fulfillment centers, we're very much in the middle of that journey right now of sort of 18 months or so into those first 2 facilities, really kind of fully understanding the scale of demand to how the customers behave and how you optimize that model. So I'd say more to come on that as we continue to understand that sort of key phase of those first 2 facilities really seeing the progress there on profitability. But from a customer demand, the customer experience, we're seeing all the sort of things we have hoped to have seen around customer engagement. \nW. McMullen: And we are actively looking for sites for some preannounced locations too on those and finding the sites ended up being a little bit more difficult than what we would have expected. \nGary Millerchip: And I think just very brief on your second question, Michael. But for us, it's about maintaining flexibility. We believe we built our model to be able to adapt and to deliver value for our customers. We gave directional numbers just because I think it's helpful on inflation because of the LIFO calculation. But our expectation is our goal will be to continue to deliver more value for customers and over time grow our share and obviously make sure we meet the customer where they are and we expect the second half of the year to have some -- definitely some things that we don't know how to perfectly plan for. We need to make sure we're nimble and agile to be adapt to that because there's clearly going to be changed in the second half of the year. \nW. McMullen: And we feel good about our overall model being able to adapt in any situation in any market because we give a great value for the customer regardless. Thanks for the question, Michael. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. \nKenneth Goldman: You mentioned that one of the reasons why working capital was higher than usual in the fourth quarter is that you were buying a little bit ahead to protect margins, I assume as inflation rises. Two underlying questions here. First, was this mainly in the grocery department. You talked about grocery being particularly tough in terms of inflation. And then maybe more importantly, I'm just curious, is there going to be an offset to this in the first quarter, maybe as you run through that higher-than-usual inventory, I guess I'm really just trying to ascertain if you're going to buy less than usual from some of your grocery vendors next quarter or this quarter. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ken. From our perspective, the main forward buying would be in pharmacy and some in grocery, that will be the 2 key areas that we looked at and felt there was a good opportunity to protect margins, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. From our perspective on working capital, certainly, some of the year-over-year variance would be things that we would expect to maintain because we are seeing continued higher inflation on inventory. And as we called out, we're expecting as we improve in-stock levels as we have that some of that will be sticky. \n We would look at some of the payables and receivables timing impact and would expect that to be coming back. In fact, if we look at our cash at the end of the first period, the first month of the new year, it was actually up by $1 billion and back in line with the prior year, which obviously wasn't the case at the year-end. So we do think some of it was timing and will flow through. But obviously, we have strong plans for the year in terms of continuing to grow with our partners. And I would focus more on -- from our perspective, how we make sure we're continuing to drive free cash flow, and we feel good about our ability to do that. \nW. McMullen: And the forward buying is really driven by the economics at any given day in terms of what's available in the marketplace. If it's a good return, we'll invest the money there. If the return is not good, then you'll see the flow of benefiting working capital. \nGary Millerchip: We didn't give exact numbers. I would also say, Ken, the forward buying would be a smaller part of the number, the timing of payments would be a bigger part of that than the actual forward buying. \nKenneth Goldman: Got it. And then a quick follow-up.  Implied operating cash flow. It's one of the questions I'm getting from investors. You gave a CapEx number, so we can back into it, obviously. Just curious why given the strong EBIT growth this year, given some of the working capital reversals, why would it not be a little bit better than what guidance is suggesting. I know you talked a little bit about this. I just wanted to get a little bit more detail on some of the underlying factors there if possible. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think I would say we try to guide to what we think is a more normalized year in 2023, Ken. Part of it, I would say we probably are being a little bit conservative because of -- we want to see how this unwind of COVID exactly plays out. A couple of examples would be if inflation does remain at high levels, obviously, that could impact inventory but also as we kind of unwind accruals on things like incentive payments, assuming we're more going to be more like an on-target incentive payment than significantly higher than on-target payout, those things can create some 1-year adjustments, too. \n So there's a few areas that just kind of create a few wrinkles. And candidly, we're trying to be conservative to make sure we can see the flow-through of the catch-up from 2022 as well. So we feel we tried -- what we tried to do is take a conservative view of a normalized environment, but there is still some, I would say, unwinding that we wanted to make sure we understood as we reported out in 2023. \nW. McMullen: And our incentive plan is designed -- our long-term incentive plan is designed such that we are incentivized to do better than the guidance we've given. \nGary Millerchip: Yes, I think it'd be fair to say our internal goal would be higher than what we shared because we do believe it's one opportunity, but we thought it was appropriate to be conservative in the circumstances. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: Also congrats on a great quarter. So I just want to touch on market share. Just curious if you look at  Kroger's performance in Q4, I'm not even sure if you have the full year data, just curious how your market share is performing versus your expectations? Because if I recall last quarter, you were starting to see improvement in the market share. \nW. McMullen: Yes. We're continuing to see improvement and if you look at internally, if you were at one of our meetings, you'd hear us continually focus on how to even continue to improve. Our objective and expectations of ourselves is to grow market share. And if you look at the higher-income shopper, in those customer segments, we did a great job gaining share in Fresh. We're doing a good job of gaining share. And I would say we're pleased with the progress, but we still are not satisfied. \nRupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up question. Just quarter-to-date. Any color you can provide in terms of what you're seeing just throughout the quarter? \nW. McMullen: Yes. As you know, we always get it. We always provide some insight. If you look so far, we're consistent with our expectations and Gary outlined a little bit about what we would expect quarterly between quarters to be. If you look at the first period, the first 4 weeks of the year, it's trending a little bit better than [indiscernible] but both of those were lower than the fourth quarter actual. And I want to remind you that ESI -- Express Scripts, I should say, is about 1.5%. And then I always hate to talk about weather, but weather was more friendly to us a year ago than it is this year and I don't ever want to use weather as an excuse, but it is an insight if you look at the current trends,  but the key point is we are trending where we expect it to be. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Spencer Hanus from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nSpencer Hanus: On Our Brands, you saw that outperform the overall comp again this quarter. Are you seeing CPGs get more willing to offer trade spend just given the share losses that they're seeing? And do you think the trade down that we've seen over the last few quarters accelerate as we move through '23? \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at a 5-year trend or a 10-year trend, Our Brands has picked up share on almost every year. And the only exception to that was a little bit of time during COVID where people had much more money in their pocket. If you look, I would say, all short statements and economics are wrong, but we still have several CPGs that are passed or trying to pass through costs more than probably their inflation. We would still see that they're more focused on profit and tonnage. And when that is true, that's when Our Brand continues to gain share. And that's the reason why Our Brand is performing so strongly. And if you look at historical cycles, eventually, that what you outlined will happen, but it hasn't started happening yet. \nSpencer Hanus: Got it. That's helpful. And then on fuel margins, you called out $0.51 during the prepared remarks, which is up more than 50% versus what it was in 2019. So  just curious how you're thinking about the sustainability of fuel margins and where those will ultimately be baseline as it just becomes a bigger part of your overall operating profit today? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Spencer. So I think as we mentioned in our prepared comments, we do believe that fuel margins will be sustained at a higher level than the historical averages. We think there's been some structural changes in that industry as you look at the last 5 years that would cause us to think that margins will be maintained at a higher level than historical levels. All that being said though, we do think -- I think I mentioned it in one of the questions earlier that we would think that fuel profitability somewhere between $200 million to $250 million headwind in 2023, largely not because we don't think that there's a continued sort of sustainability in fuel margins. But if you remember last year, when the war in Ukraine was announced, there were some real volatility in prices. And we think some of those shocks that happened around those times generally don't get repeated and cycle. So it's really allowing some of those sort of onetime unusual spikes in pricing or changes in pricing. But fundamentally, we believe fuel will be sustained at high levels. \nW. McMullen: The other thing just to add to Gary's point. When retail fuel prices are high, customers engage in our fuel rewards a lot more and we provide significant discounts to customers through our fuel rewards. If prices come down, usually our reward costs will go down there as well. So you have to look at all the pieces together. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nLeah Jordan: This is Leah Jordan. You called out sourcing again as a tailwind this quarter. How are you managing that differently today? How much of an opportunity do you still see there? And is there anything assumed within the cost savings guidance as well? \nW. McMullen: I'll let Gary get into the details. But in sourcing, it's an area where several years ago, we really didn't have a separate department and didn't have professionals that manage that organization. And a couple of leaders and now reports to Gary, they've done a great job of finding talent that understands how to source product, understands the cost of the ingredients and all the pieces. And it's really turned it into a professional organization, and it's under the leadership of Mike Donnelly and Erin Sharp and a few people that have retired and now it's under Gary's leadership. And I just think that team has done a great job of bringing professionalism to the area. In terms of the specifics, now I'll let Gary get into the details. \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, [ Kate ]. Yes, we certainly believe that we -- it's a bit like our overall approach to taking cost out of the business. We started out saying, how do we make sure we're as efficient as we can be and then really become, I think, part of the culture and part of the capability in the organization and the team is working together, I'd say it's across merchandising, operations, supply chain and sourcing, all kind of collaborating on how do we design for value. \n So whether that be, as Rodney mentioned, continuing to make sure we understand the cost that makes the product and build the product and get the product to our stores in a way that we're able to make sure we're being dynamic in negotiating and managing those costs effectively where they change, but it's also about optimizing product design. It's looking at product end-to-end and improving, whether it's packaging or product design and optimizing with customer demand alongside how we can then really match the customer expectations with how we're actually designing the products to really drive the maximum value. And I'd say a bit like the productivity savings, one of those things where every year, we see a road map to additional savings, additional opportunities. And I think that will continue to be the case based on our experience so far. \nLeah Jordan: Great. And I have one quick follow-up on SNAP. Just giving any -- the potential changes there. How did you think about that with your guidance. And also, given you have such a diverse footprint, is there any color you could provide on the stores where states they've already had that extra allotment roll off? \nW. McMullen: If you look at SNAP, we've assumed that it's a meaningful headwind for the balance of the year. We're hopeful that everybody will work together to continue or find additional money because, as you know, because of inflation, there's a lot of people whose budget is under strain, but we have assumed that, that was a meaningful headwind both in the quarter and for the balance of the year. \n I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? \nGary Millerchip: No, I think it ties to the point about there is still uncertainty, so we're making sure that we're allowing for that in our guidance for the year. I would say historically, and you probably or say this before that it's actually very difficult to find a correlation between SNAP in the market and spend on food at home because typically, it tends to impact more discretionary spend. But I think our view was that we've never really had a point in time where we've had so much SNAP dollars in the market. So we believe most of the models that we've looked at for the last 30 years are kind of difficult to say, well, they hold true in this environment. So we felt it was important to be conservative given that we are in a unique time. \nOperator: Our final question for today comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nKelly Bania: Rodney and Gary. I wanted to ask just about what your guidance assumes regarding the broader promotional environment. And I guess particularly thinking about the back half when maybe inflation is at a little bit of a lower level, do you expect competition and promotional activity to heat up? This seems to be one of the key investor concerns as we head into next year. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Kelly. I think from our perspective, we feel that we have to be agile, and we're certainly shooting in our guidance that we'll be continuing to invest in value for the customer. I think one of the things that we believe has changed somewhat during the COVID environment is the situation of how the customer shops and engages with you is different. And what I mean by that is many more customers are engaged digitally, which gives us the ability to truly be able to personalize and bring together all the different pieces. So it's less about just what you see when you enter the store, it's about the fuel rewards that we can target for that customer. It's the personalized digital coupons. \n It's the Our Brands offers that, as Rodney mentioned earlier, can save the customer 10% on an equivalent basket if they decide to shift to some of those products. So we believe we've learned a lot through the pandemic of how do you really channel those dollars in the most effective way, and that's what gives us the confidence that as we think about the rest of the year. We'll continue to invest in value for the customer, but that we can do that even more effectively than the past to make sure that we stretch those dollars further to deliver value for our customers. \nW. McMullen: And one of the things that I think is always important to make sure a lot customers also decide where to shop based on how the freshness of product and the friendliness of associates, and that's part of the overall value equation. So when you look at how we go to market, we have personalized offers, we have promotions, we have fuel rewards. And the customer will engage in those to manage their budget and then they win by having incredibly fresh product and incredibly friendly associates. And that's how somebody decides where to shop. So I really think it's important for you to look at all those together. \nKelly Bania: Okay. Great. And just to follow up on the discussion of units and inflation. I think as we look at this year comps, 5% to 6% range with inflation, I believe, in the double-digit range. So maybe would imply units or tonnage down high single digit. And for next year, 2.5% to 3.5% maybe seems to assume a pretty meaningful acceleration in units. So just maybe correct me where I'm wrong on that math? Or just help us understand what would maybe drive a better unit or tonnage backdrop for Kroger in '23? \nW. McMullen: The unit change wouldn't be as much as you said because remember also, people are switching to Our Brands and other things, where the ring per item is less, but we sell more units. So when you look at overall, and if you look overall, we also look at share and if when you look at units in total, they're declining as well. So we would expect to continue to make progress in improving our share and the flow-through of units would come from that. I don't know, Gary, anything... \nGary Millerchip: No... \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Kelly, for the question. With that, obviously, thanks to everyone for all your questions. And as always, before we close, I'd like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in. We invite our associates to come to Kroger for a job and discover a career. And I can't think of a better example of this than an associate at our Cincinnati, Dayton division, [indiscernible] came to the United States from Togo. After a few weeks as a bagger, his store manager, Brian asked him if he'd be interested in leading the dairy department in his store. Because of the dedication, determination and great job that he's done, [indiscernible] is now the center store specialist, and I can't wait to see what's next for this amazing young man. \n I'm inspired every day by the amazing work each of you do and could not be more humbled to be part of this world-class team as we enter the next year. Thank you for making Kroger the incredible place that it is. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. That concludes today's call. \nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by sharing how incredibly optimistic I am about Kroger's future. Our performance last year demonstrates how Kroger is consistently delivering for our customers, our associates and our communities and by doing so, creating value for our shareholders. Since announcing our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy at our 2020 Investor Day, we have made tremendous progress against our commitments.  \n As you will see from the chart on Slide 6 of the presentation deck Rob mentioned, we are delivering a fresh, affordable and seamless shopping experience for our customers with 0 compromise on value, quality, selection or convenience. We are advancing our purpose to feed the human spirit by significantly increasing associate wages and uplifting our communities. And we are delivering on our financial commitments through our strong resilient value creation model. With this strategy, we exceeded our financial goals and delivered attractive total shareholder returns during the past 2 years.  \n In 2022, customer preferences shifted in response to inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers were looking for more ways to stretch their budget. The gap between food at home and food away from home spending grew in the fourth quarter as more customers gravitated toward affordable meal solutions that restaurants simply can't provide. Our research shows that cooking at home is 3 to 4x less expensive than dining out. And as Kroger was there for our customers, innovating quickly to meet their needs and wants, our nimble and customer-focused approach helped us deliver strong results in 2022, leading to total household growth and enhanced customer loyalty. We saw an especially strong response in our higher income households as this segment grew by 1.1 million households, further illustrating the resiliency in our model and strong value proposition we offer customers across all segments.  \n Gary will get into the specific details of our 2022 financial results and outlook for 2023 a little later. Before doing so, I'd like to spend some time reviewing how each pillar of our go-to-market strategy provided meaningful and measurable customer benefits last year and how we will accelerate those benefits in 2023. The foundation of our go-to-market strategy is fresh, our brands, personalization and seamless. By delivering on these 4 pillars, our customers win and Kroger attracts new and more loyal customers. At the center of our go-to-market strategy is a superior customer experience. We deliver that by consistently providing customers a full, fresh and friendly experience.  \n Kroger continued to demonstrate operational excellence in 2022 as we saw improvements in all 3 metrics. We believe our go-to-market strategy is creating a unique value -- customer value proposition designed to perform in many economic environments. We will continue to invest in our pillars and the customer experience to differentiate the value we offer.  \n First, leading with fresh. As an important influence on where customers shop, we are constantly improving how we bring even fresher food to our stores and e-commerce experience. Our end-to-end fresh initiative is changing the way our teams deliver on our commitment to freshness and we are incredibly pleased with this success. In 2022, more than 1,400 stores implemented the end-to-end produce solution, driving measurable increases in both fresh and total store sales. In 2023, we will continue innovating the fresh experience to drive customer satisfaction and improve our product mix. We continue to improve inventory management tools, strengthen our supply chain to deliver additional days of freshness and enhance our offerings to meet customer demand.  \n As a reminder, our merger with Home Chef brought significant capabilities in in-store and restaurant quality meal solutions. We will be expanding our home chef production facilities to meet this growing customer need.  \n Next, Our Brands. The Our Brands portfolio allows us to offer exciting products at great value while driving incremental sales and improving margins. Our Brand's quality and value proposition is especially important when inflation is affecting so many of our customers' lives. To meet the needs of customers on a budget, we launched a new opening price point product line called Smart Way. By consolidating and simplifying several brands into one, we are making it easier for customers while creating a point of differentiation across the full portfolio. We will continue expanding Our Brands to more categories with innovative product offerings. Our goal is to help every customer find high-quality, affordable products they love from pantry staples to fresh food to ready-to-heat restaurant quality meals.  \n Now I'll move to personalization. Our data science teams are using predictive science to serve customers the right products at the right time and at the best value. Because we know our customers so well, we were able to provide recommendations to start their baskets and deliver personalized offers on the products most important to them, saving them time and money and making their lives easier. In return, our customers reward us with their trust and loyalty, consistently ranking us among the best at being able to offer personalized savings and solutions that meet their needs.  \n In 2022, we grew loyalty as our customers more deeply engaged with personalized coupons and fuel rewards. As customers look for more ways to save, digital coupon engagement hit an all-time high during the year. Our combined paper and digital coupons helped save our customers more than $1.4 billion on products they need and want. That's on top of our everyday promotions and all the other value we offer.  \n To provide even more value, we launched Boost, the industry's most affordable membership nationwide in July. Early results are exceeding our expectations with incremental engagement and overall household spend. We are evolving Boost with new benefits to further broaden its appeal and create additional customer value. In 2023, we will make significant investments to build out our personalization capabilities, including increasing the use of real-time data to predict customer needs, which will support sales growth during the next 3 years.  \n Finally, turning to Seamless. Seamless is growing in importance among our customers, and we expect it will be a significant growth driver over the next several years. We have built a digital platform that offers a seamless shopping experience with 0 compromise, allowing customers to shift effortlessly between store, pickup and delivery solutions.  \n As you'll see on Slide 12, our combination of stores and dedicated fulfillment centers positions Kroger to serve all customer trips from in-stock shopping to rapid delivery on needed now items to large stock up orders. Despite the easing of pandemic-related shopping behaviors that led to a significant increase in online shopping, more and more customers are incorporating e-commerce into their daily permanent routines, recognizing the value and convenience online shopping offers. We expect digital sales will continue to grow at a faster pace than overall food at home sales and believe Kroger is well positioned to deliver double-digit growth in over the next 3 years.  \n As we work to become the most trusted online grocery destination, we are focused on 4 key areas that will position us to deliver that growth. We start by providing a compelling Kroger owned digital destination, where we offer customers exceptional value, personalization and freshness in a single, easy-to-use online experience. Second, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment, driving trust and loyalty by exceeding expectations for quality and freshness. Our delivery approach is unique in the fact that we have a large store network conveniently located close to our customers and large dedicated fulfillment centers designed efficiently to pick large orders. Our dedicated fulfillment centers provide the most reliable experience, the highest in-stock levels, best on-time delivery and one-of-a-kind white glove experience with industry-leading Net Promoter Scores.  \n Kroger delivery customers are more engaged across our entire ecosystem, spending more and shopping with us more often. Looking ahead, we will continue to learn through our customer fulfillment network with a focus on driving profitability and efficiencies to ensure that we are well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth while delighting our customers.  \n Next, we are focused on reaching new customers and adding more shopping occasions. Our delivery network allows us to offer enhanced service to new customers, and we will also grow our share of wallet by increasing the number of orders customers place with us. Solutions like Kroger Delivery Now enabled by our vast network of conveniently located stores can connect customers to fresh groceries and household essentials in as little as 30 minutes. This seamless ecosystem makes any shopping experience simple for our customers.  \n Finally, we are driving our profit flywheel and improving margins by reducing our digital cost to serve and growing our alternative profit streams. To accomplish this goal, we are lowering fulfillment costs, building the density of demand and last mile routing, engaging directly with our third-party vendors and growing digital retail media.  \n Now let me share how we are accelerating growth in our model through alternative profits. During the last several years, we invested heavily in technology to transform our business and enter new high-growth and high-return businesses. These businesses contribute meaningfully to our results with alternative profit businesses achieving $1.2 billion in operating profit in 2022. Kroger Precision Marketing is one of our fastest-growing businesses and is well positioned to win within the U.S. retail media landscape, which is projected to be a $55 billion industry by 2024. What makes our retail media business special is our ability to help brands achieve a greater return on their media investment.  \n For the fifth year in a row, KPM was recognized as a leader in the retail media space by the Path to Purchase Institute, which collects feedback from those closest to the retail media networks and accessing their effectiveness. KPM was recognized as a leader for many of its capabilities, including maintaining its leadership in targeting and measurement capabilities, a testament to the strength of our unique product offerings and the insights we bring to this emerging landscape. Our associates enable our success, and we are committed to investing in theirs.  \n To remain an employer of choice, we support our associates development and holistic well-being. We provide our associates with the tools they need to grow their careers that they want at all stages. In 2022, Kroger was named as a Best Place to Work in IT for the fifth consecutive year and a best place to work for disability inclusion for the third year. We also continue to support our associates through investments in wages and comprehensive benefits. In 2022, we raised our average hourly rates by more than 6% and has now invested an incremental $1.9 billion in associate wages since 2018. Our average hourly rate is now more than $18 and more than $23 when you include comprehensive benefits. We are committed to sustainably increasing associate wages and plan to invest more than $770 million in associates in 2023. We value and respect our associates and investing in their success is just one way we demonstrate that.  \n We take seriously our role in helping to create a healthier and thriving neighborhoods across the country. The centerpiece of our efforts is Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan, an industry-leading commitment to build communities free from hunger and waste. Since launching Zero Hunger | Zero Waste, we have made continual progress toward our goals. We have directed more than $1.65 billion in food and funds to help end hunger, including donating more than 2.3 billion meals. We are making progress on our carbon emissions reduction plan and our brand's sustainable packaging goal. I'm especially proud of our incredible associates who helped us reach a key milestone this year with 100% execution of our surplus food rescue programs across each and every store across the company.  \n Looking ahead, we will continue to focus our efforts on our ambitious goal of ending hunger in our communities and eliminating waste, especially food waste throughout the company.  In summary, our proven go-to-market strategy led to enhanced loyalty and household growth as we help customers manage the effect of inflation in 2022. We are well positioned to sustain our momentum into 2023.  \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our results and expectations for 2023. Gary? Thanks, Gary. Before we open up the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with Albertsons. During the past few months, we've spent time getting to know Vivek and the Albertsons leadership team. We are incredibly impressed with their talent, culture and commitment to their customers and communities. We look forward to bringing together our 2 highly complementary organizations to provide customers with lower prices and more choices while realizing the long-term value we expect this merger will deliver.  \n We are working cooperatively with regulators responding to the Federal Trade Commission's second request and in discussions about the transaction, while also working to identify potential buyers for the stores, we expect to divest to obtain clearance for the transaction. We are pleased with the level of interest received thus far, and we'll work towards finding a solution that benefits all stakeholders. We remain on track to close the transaction in early 2024.  \n During the quarter, we launched our integration planning efforts with the goal of preparing for a seamless cultural and operational integration. We expect to create customer benefits beginning day 1 post close. The integration team is developing work streams with clear objectives and milestones to deliver value for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. We are pleased with the progress we've made to date, and we'll continue to provide updates as we have them.  \n We achieved exceptional results in 2022, building on our record years in 2020 and 2021, and we exceeded our commitments in our Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital strategy. Our folks strategy is focusing on our customers, our associates and our communities is working. Our customers are telling us that we're doing a better job serving their needs. We continue to improve our associate wages and comprehensive benefits with a 34% increase in the last 5 years. And we are helping to create healthier thriving communities through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste work. We believe our momentum is sustainable and will only accelerate upon the completion of our pending merger with Albertsons.  \n With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions. And John, thanks. I love the question. And we always look at it slightly different because we look at the opportunity is all the business. And even in places where we over-index, there's still a lot of opportunity. Customers that are most loyal to us will still spend 30% to 50% of their spending somewhere other than Kroger. And that's an opportunity for us to improve our position. When you look at Fresh, we start off with a higher share of Fresh than we do in the other parts. But it's an area where we're meaningfully better than our competitors. So our ability and focus on growing our business is to really -- what we find is full Fresh and friendly resonates with all customer types, and we do it in a way where there's 0 compromise.  \n So a customer on a budget can get great value from Our Brands. They can save 7% to 10% by buying Our Brands versus national brand. If you look at our Home Chef and products related to that, a customer can get a meal for 1/3 to 1/4 of what it costs going out. So it's really all of those together. And our opportunity -- our sweet spot is always the customer that likes a good value for the money and Fresh is incredibly important and friendly is incredibly important. That's our sweet spot where we connect the best and that is a growing area across the U.S., and we operate in many markets that are growing as well. So for us, that's really our sweet spot and our opportunity and our strategy is oriented around that. And then technology just provides the support for that make it easier for the customer. If you look the numbers that Gary provided by far, the majority of that's pharmacy. Our teams are doing great work on using our discount cards to be able to help customers identify other alternatives. And in fact, in many cases, they're saving money. We're also going directly with some other companies to provide the benefit rather than going through a PBM. So by far, the majority of the estimate that Gary provided is pharmacy. And we're using the things that you said to make sure that we don't lose that customer connection and we don't lose the trip to the grocery store.  \n I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? Yes. If you look at inflation overall, we would expect inflation to be higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year and the quarterly insights that Gary provided really reflected that. If you look at the thing that we feel really good about, and I shared specifics on the prepared comments, the higher income customer is really resonating with our value proposition, and we're having meaningful increases there in terms of that customer.  \n And one of the things I always think it's important for people to realize is the profitability of that customer is higher as well because they shop for the full mix of our stores and they would be buying more produce in Fresh departments and Deli bakery, which is driving some of that profitability shift. So when you look at overall, we feel really good on how we're connecting with our customers. We feel really good at how we're improving on Fresh. And when you look at the share that we're getting with the customer that really focuses on that, we feel good about. When you look at it overall, we're always striving to do better. And I feel good about the progress we're making. We're excited about the opportunities we have in front of us, and we still think we can continue to do better.  In terms of specifics on inflation, Gary, I'll let you share the specific inflation assumption because it's pretty -- during the year, it's obviously pretty wide range. We would certainly describe it and look at it different than that. And we've invested in pricing -- I'm trying to remember for the last 20 years or so every single year and would expect to continue to do that. And we fund that through process change, identifying other things to get costs out. And an awful lot of our promotions are much more directed personalized to the customer. So it's not what you see when you go to a store to look on a shelf because we provide a significant higher percentage of our value to our customers through fuel rewards and personalized offers that are connected one-on-one from -- in using technology and digital so that each person is individual. \n So we would certainly not describe it that way. And we view it -- every year is incredibly competitive, and everybody is working hard to do a better job and the customer gets the benefit of that. When you look at our digital business long term, we wouldn't see the profitability be any difference in this supermarket when you look at it over a longer period of time. And if you look, what we find is a customer when they move online, they actually after a year engage with us more in store than before. So what we're really focused on is having an ecosystem where the customer thinks food, they think Kroger. And what we're finding is the customer routinely moves back and forth between the different channels. \n If you look at each piece of it, every single day, you're working to figure out ways to improve processes and take costs out. And then on top of it, obviously, retail media is an important part of the driver. So when you look at it long term, we really see no change in the opportunity and potential. We're incredibly excited and everything that we see, we think it will be more important in 3 years, 5 years, 10 years to have where the customer engage with us through multiple ways. And the digital channel is a critical part of that, and we find the customer engages with us digitally, even when they don't shop digitally. So for us, we see it as exciting as we did before. We don't see the long-term profitability being different. And we're working continually in terms of both internally and with our partners on how to improve processes. And we are actively looking for sites for some preannounced locations too on those and finding the sites ended up being a little bit more difficult than what we would have expected. And we feel good about our overall model being able to adapt in any situation in any market because we give a great value for the customer regardless. Thanks for the question, Michael. And the forward buying is really driven by the economics at any given day in terms of what's available in the marketplace. If it's a good return, we'll invest the money there. If the return is not good, then you'll see the flow of benefiting working capital. And our incentive plan is designed -- our long-term incentive plan is designed such that we are incentivized to do better than the guidance we've given. Yes. We're continuing to see improvement and if you look at internally, if you were at one of our meetings, you'd hear us continually focus on how to even continue to improve. Our objective and expectations of ourselves is to grow market share. And if you look at the higher-income shopper, in those customer segments, we did a great job gaining share in Fresh. We're doing a good job of gaining share. And I would say we're pleased with the progress, but we still are not satisfied. Yes. As you know, we always get it. We always provide some insight. If you look so far, we're consistent with our expectations and Gary outlined a little bit about what we would expect quarterly between quarters to be. If you look at the first period, the first 4 weeks of the year, it's trending a little bit better than [indiscernible] but both of those were lower than the fourth quarter actual. And I want to remind you that ESI -- Express Scripts, I should say, is about 1.5%. And then I always hate to talk about weather, but weather was more friendly to us a year ago than it is this year and I don't ever want to use weather as an excuse, but it is an insight if you look at the current trends,  but the key point is we are trending where we expect it to be. Yes. If you look at a 5-year trend or a 10-year trend, Our Brands has picked up share on almost every year. And the only exception to that was a little bit of time during COVID where people had much more money in their pocket. If you look, I would say, all short statements and economics are wrong, but we still have several CPGs that are passed or trying to pass through costs more than probably their inflation. We would still see that they're more focused on profit and tonnage. And when that is true, that's when Our Brand continues to gain share. And that's the reason why Our Brand is performing so strongly. And if you look at historical cycles, eventually, that what you outlined will happen, but it hasn't started happening yet. The other thing just to add to Gary's point. When retail fuel prices are high, customers engage in our fuel rewards a lot more and we provide significant discounts to customers through our fuel rewards. If prices come down, usually our reward costs will go down there as well. So you have to look at all the pieces together. I'll let Gary get into the details. But in sourcing, it's an area where several years ago, we really didn't have a separate department and didn't have professionals that manage that organization. And a couple of leaders and now reports to Gary, they've done a great job of finding talent that understands how to source product, understands the cost of the ingredients and all the pieces. And it's really turned it into a professional organization, and it's under the leadership of Mike Donnelly and Erin Sharp and a few people that have retired and now it's under Gary's leadership. And I just think that team has done a great job of bringing professionalism to the area. In terms of the specifics, now I'll let Gary get into the details. If you look at SNAP, we've assumed that it's a meaningful headwind for the balance of the year. We're hopeful that everybody will work together to continue or find additional money because, as you know, because of inflation, there's a lot of people whose budget is under strain, but we have assumed that, that was a meaningful headwind both in the quarter and for the balance of the year. \n I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? And one of the things that I think is always important to make sure a lot customers also decide where to shop based on how the freshness of product and the friendliness of associates, and that's part of the overall value equation. So when you look at how we go to market, we have personalized offers, we have promotions, we have fuel rewards. And the customer will engage in those to manage their budget and then they win by having incredibly fresh product and incredibly friendly associates. And that's how somebody decides where to shop. So I really think it's important for you to look at all those together. The unit change wouldn't be as much as you said because remember also, people are switching to Our Brands and other things, where the ring per item is less, but we sell more units. So when you look at overall, and if you look overall, we also look at share and if when you look at units in total, they're declining as well. So we would expect to continue to make progress in improving our share and the flow-through of units would come from that. I don't know, Gary, anything... Thanks, Kelly, for the question. With that, obviously, thanks to everyone for all your questions. And as always, before we close, I'd like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in. We invite our associates to come to Kroger for a job and discover a career. And I can't think of a better example of this than an associate at our Cincinnati, Dayton division, [indiscernible] came to the United States from Togo. After a few weeks as a bagger, his store manager, Brian asked him if he'd be interested in leading the dairy department in his store. Because of the dedication, determination and great job that he's done, [indiscernible] is now the center store specialist, and I can't wait to see what's next for this amazing young man. \n I'm inspired every day by the amazing work each of you do and could not be more humbled to be part of this world-class team as we enter the next year. Thank you for making Kroger the incredible place that it is. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. That concludes today's call."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into our 2022 results and sharing our outlook for 2023, I'd like to take a step back and remind you how Kroger's value creation model is enabling the company to deliver sustainable value for our shareholders. We believe our value creation model has been a key to delivering consistently strong results over the past 4 years and is positioning Kroger for growth in years to come.  \n The go-to-market strategy that Rodney outlined earlier is the foundation of our model. Over recent years, we have invested significantly in our people, our customers and technology to create a leading omnichannel position in food retail. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we win customers in our core supermarket business, including health and fuel and drive significant customer traffic and data into our ecosystem. This, in turn, allows us to deploy our investments in technology and 84.51\u00b0 to deliver even greater value for customers and create new high-growth, high-margin alternative profit businesses.  \n The value generated from these businesses enables us to reinvest back into our supermarkets and drive further store and digital traffic, creating a flywheel effect. We are evolving from a traditional food retailer into a more diverse food first business that we believe can deliver sustainable future growth and succeed in a variety of operating environments.  \n As a reminder, since introducing this model in 2019, we have achieved consistent returns for our shareholders that have significantly exceeded our TSR commitment of 8% to 11%.  As you can see in the table on Slide 19, over the past 3 years, Kroger has achieved more than 19% compounded annual growth rate in adjusted FIFO net operating profit and approximately 25% compounded annual growth rate in adjusted EPS. Over this same time period, we generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $9.7 billion and have returned a total of nearly $5.8 billion to investors via dividends and buybacks.  \n Overall, we have delivered nearly 3x the expected return from our TSR model over this 3-year period. Importantly, at the same time, we continue to invest in the business to support future growth. This included improving our price position relative to key competitors since the start of the pandemic, increasing associate wages and benefits by 34% since 2018 and increasing the amount of capital investments allocated to technology and digital capabilities to enable top line growth and margin expansion.  \n Our strong performance and progress with our model in recent years also gave us the financial flexibility and confidence to announce our proposed merger with Albertsons. Upon closing, which is anticipated to be in early 2024, we believe the merger will significantly accelerate our go-to-market strategy and deliver TSR well above our stand-alone model during the first 4 years post close.  \n I'll now walk through our full year 2022 financial results. Kroger delivered adjusted EPS of $4.23 per diluted share, an increase of 15%. We achieved identical sales, excluding fuel of 5.6%. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 9 basis points. This reflects the outstanding work of our merchandising and sourcing teams who are extremely effective in managing higher product cost inflation while maintaining competitive prices and helping customers manage their budgets. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 19 basis points, reflecting sales leverage and cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by planned investments in associates. And I'm delighted to say for the fifth consecutive year, we delivered cost savings of $1 billion in 2022. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $5.1 billion, an increase of 18% from last year. And the LIFO charge for the full year was $626 million compared to $197 million in 2021.  \n Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.99 for the quarter, an increase of almost 9%. We saw continued momentum in our identical sales without fuel of 6.2%. Underlying growth would have been 6.7% after adjusting for the effect of Express Scripts. Our Brands contributed another strong quarter with identical sales of 10.1%, reflecting the growing importance to customers of these exclusive to Kroger products. And digital sales also accelerated during the quarter, up 12%, led by 22% growth in Delivery Solutions. Kroger's FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel decreased 1 basis point and the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items decreased 56 basis points.  \n Fuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition. Our loyalty program, which can save customers up to $1.25 per gallon has been one of the many ways we have helped customers stretch their dollars over the past year and contributed to our gallon sales outpacing the industry during the quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $3.39 compared to $3.30 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.51 compared to $0.44 in the same quarter last year.  \n Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.27 billion, a year-over-year increase of 26%. And the LIFO charge was $234 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting sustained higher product cost inflation, particularly in grocery. This compares to a charge of only $20 million in Q4 last year.  \n Included in our fourth quarter results was a $164 million goodwill and fixed asset impairment charge related to Vitacost.com. The talent and capabilities gained through the merger with Vitacost in 2014 have been key to advancing Kroger's digital platform and growing our digital business to more than $10 billion in annual sales. As our digital strategy has evolved, our primary focus looking forward will be to effectively utilize Kroger store pickup and delivery capabilities, and this reprioritization resulted in the impairment charge. Vitacost.com will continue to operate as an online platform, providing great value, natural, organic and eco-friendly products for our customers.  \n Adjusted free cash flow for the year came in $800 million lower than anticipated. This was entirely due to movements in working capital towards the end of the year. The cause was a combination of factors including higher inflation affecting inventory, some forward buying to protect margins and timing of accounts payable and third-party receivable payments around the year-end. As shared last quarter, we feel comfortable with our overall level of mix of inventory, which is higher due to heightened levels of inflation and in-stocks returning to pre-pandemic levels.  \n Looking over a 5-year time horizon and smoothing the volatility in working capital experience during the pandemic, we have seen an underlying benefit from working capital over this time period, and we would expect to see further improvement going forward. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. And as shared in our guidance this morning, expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2023.  \n Turning now to financial strategy and capital allocation. We will continue to be disciplined with our capital investments, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for our shareholders. As you saw in our guidance this morning, we are anticipating capital investments of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion this year, which is consistent with our long-range TSR model. Our priorities for 2023 are aligned with our value creation model and are expected to drive future sales growth and margin expansion.  \n To drive sales, our focus is on enhancing our store and digital ecosystem. We apply a data-driven approach to make decisions on a store-by-store basis, prioritizing store formats and locations with the highest growth potential. Additionally, we are continually enhancing our seamless experience including investing in technology to improve the customer proposition and augmenting personalization, which will, in turn, create additional alternative profit opportunities. We continue to invest in areas of the business that will drive operating margin expansion, including enhancements to our supply chain capabilities. These investments help improve margins and differentiate our fresh offering.  \n And finally, an essential element of our value creation model has been our ability to take cost out of our business. We remain focused on eliminating waste in areas that did not affect the customer experience and we are making investments in technology to improve store productivity, lower digital fulfillment costs and reduce waste and shrink. These improvements will drive an incremental $1 billion of cost savings in 2023, which would mark our sixth year in a row of delivering $1 billion of savings.  \n In closing, I'd like to share some additional color on our expectations for 2023. While there is still uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, our go-to-market strategy is resonating with customers, and we believe our successful value creation model positions us well to navigate evolving market conditions.  \n Before I go into the details of our 2023 guidance, there are a couple of unusual factors that I'd like to highlight. First, Kroger's decision to terminate our agreement with Express Groups in December of 2022 is expected to have a negative impact of 150 basis points on identical sales without fuel. This decision is not expected to have a material effect on profitability.  \n Second, 2023 will include a 53rd week. We expect the effect of this extra week at approximately $0.15 to our adjusted net earnings per diluted share for the year. With that important context, we expect to achieve identical sales without fuel of 1% to 2% in 2023. Excluding the effect of Express Scripts, our underlying identical sales without fuel growth is expected to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. We expect to achieve adjusted FIFO operating profit of between $5 billion and $5.2 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of between $4.45 and $4.60, including the expected benefit of the 53rd week.  \n We expect to grow revenue by continuing to invest in our customers through competitive pricing and personalization and providing fresh products and a better shopping experience across our store and digital ecosystem. We will fund investments in gross margin in 2023 by improving our product mix as we accelerate momentum with our Fresh and Our Brands initiatives and by growing our alternative profit businesses.  \n As Rodney mentioned earlier, we will also continue to invest significantly in associate wages and this will be funded by our planned cost-saving initiatives. While we believe fuel margins will remain structurally higher than historical averages, fuel profitability is expected to be a headwind to our model in 2023 as we lap historic fuel margins from last year. Our 2023 guidance assumes a LIFO charge of between $300 million to $350 million as a result of lower product cost inflation compared to 2022. While this amount is well above historical levels, LIFO is expected to be a year-over-year tailwind and should more than offset lower fuel profitability.  \n In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect identical sales without fuel to be above the top end of our guidance range in the first half of the year as we continue to experience heightened levels of inflation. In the second half of the year, we expect identical sales without fuel to be at or slightly below the bottom end of our range as we expect inflation to taper later in the year. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share in quarter 1 will be slightly negative year-over-year as we cycle 22% growth in EPS from Q1 last year. Quarter 2 and quarter 3 are expected to be within our annual guidance range and quarter 4 is expected to be above our guidance range as we cycle the higher LIFO charge in '22 and benefit from the 53rd week.  \n As you know from Rodney and myself this morning, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and the investments that we have made in our go-to-market strategy provide exciting opportunities for future growth. Our team is energized by these opportunities and we believe Kroger is well positioned to continue to deliver attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders.  \n I'll now turn the call back over to Rodney. I think you said it well, Rodney.  I think that John described it, but work the team has done around using our data and personalization to make sure we're protecting the customer. We think it's working. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Ed. From an inflation perspective, what we're seeing at the moment is that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, inflation has really sort of stabilized. And what we're starting to see is in the Fresh categories, sort of deceleration of inflation, but grocery is -- has remained pretty stubborn in terms of the levels there.  \n So we're assuming, as Rodney mentioned, in the first half of the year that a gradual decline, probably grocery remaining fairly stubborn where it is today, but some of the Fresh categories continuing to show some deceleration. And then we're expecting sort of towards the end of the year that we get to sort of between low and mid-single-digit inflation level rates about sort of 4% to 5% would be our assumption around where we think inflation starts to come down to in the way that we build our assumptions for the year. And obviously, Our Brand... Go ahead, Ed. Yes. As you know, we generally don't get into a ton of specific guidance. But I would say, in general, we're thinking and the way we built our model is very much in balance and consistent with what we delivered in 2022 in terms of -- when you think about gross margin, we'll be continuing to invest in the customer in key areas of value whatever important to them, whether that's pricing, promotions continuing to roll out Boost, which creates a short-term headwind as you build the loyalty of the customer and get the incremental value over a longer period of time.  \n We believe that there'll be some continued meaningful tailwinds in our gross margin rate as we continue to execute on our go-to-market strategy. So thinking about alternative profit streams. The work I mentioned in my prepared remarks about continuing to see improvement in Our Brands penetration, which is helpful to gross margin. And so we overall, think it's going to be a pretty balanced year. There's an awful lot going in there as we're investing in the customer, investing in the experience. But as our model is now kind of reaching more of a rhythm and maturity of delivering on those gross margin improvements that we're able to balance those things.  \n I would say from an Express Scripts point of view and some of the other work that we've done around Kroger Specialty Pharmacy are making sure that we're really focusing on profitable growth in our health and wellness business that those probably create a call it, a sort of 10 basis point tailwind in gross margin, but a 10 basis point headwind in OG&A. It's kind of net, net neutral in terms of the operating profit impact, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, but it will change the optics a bit just because the sort of pulling those sales numbers out of our overall business model. Yes. I think what I'd probably say, Simeon, as I think about it, the sort of 3 bigger picture moving parts that I tried to sort of tee up the overall guidance with as well. So I think about it as the 53rd week adding, call it, $0.15 of earnings per share. So that's helping with -- think of $0.01 of about $9 million to $10 million. So I think if it's like $150 million tailwind from the 53rd week. I think of gas, so fuel being a headwind of -- in the sort of $200 million to $250 million range.  \n And then I would think of the sort of core supermarket business is really sort of continuing to grow year-over-year. So the gap is more than offsetting the impact of the 53rd week.  The core supermarket business sort of executing on our value creation model, as I mentioned. So underlying sales growth in that 2.5% to 3.5% growth because the Express Scripts business really hasn't contribute to the bottom line, continuing to invest in the customer, continuing to execute on our plans around driving cost out of the business and improving mix and those things net overall getting us to a slight improvement.  And I'll probably -- we won't get into the specifics obviously of breaking down the individual pieces, but we really categorize all profit as part of the overall ecosystem because we don't have media revenue unless we're driving the digital supermarket business. So we very much look at it as a total ecosystem. Maybe just to add, Rodney -- Michael, to the sort of short-term answer to Rodney's long-term perspective, I would say that we are seeing the benefits flow through in the profitability that we talked about on prior investor meetings. So if you think about our existing digital business today, pick up through the store delivery, what we're seeing is the cost to serve. We had our best ever quarter for the cost to serve a digital order in the Q4 of 2022. \n Rodney mentioned media, the amount of media revenue we generate per digital transaction continues to grow. So those are 2 of the big drivers that we expect to drive digital profitability, and we continue to see improvements in '22, and we expect improvements in '23 that were actually part of the tailwind in the financial model I described earlier. So we remain on that path and we are making good progress. Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll try and be brief on those 2. So I think just to clarify on the first part of the question, I was describing the majority of our digital business today. So think about pickup through the stores, think about the work that we're doing in delivery to customers today. And when we share that doubling our digital profitability, that was based on those metrics. And so how do we improve the cost to serve, how do we improve digital media revenue. \n On the customer fulfillment centers, we're very much in the middle of that journey right now of sort of 18 months or so into those first 2 facilities, really kind of fully understanding the scale of demand to how the customers behave and how you optimize that model. So I'd say more to come on that as we continue to understand that sort of key phase of those first 2 facilities really seeing the progress there on profitability. But from a customer demand, the customer experience, we're seeing all the sort of things we have hoped to have seen around customer engagement. And I think just very brief on your second question, Michael. But for us, it's about maintaining flexibility. We believe we built our model to be able to adapt and to deliver value for our customers. We gave directional numbers just because I think it's helpful on inflation because of the LIFO calculation. But our expectation is our goal will be to continue to deliver more value for customers and over time grow our share and obviously make sure we meet the customer where they are and we expect the second half of the year to have some -- definitely some things that we don't know how to perfectly plan for. We need to make sure we're nimble and agile to be adapt to that because there's clearly going to be changed in the second half of the year. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ken. From our perspective, the main forward buying would be in pharmacy and some in grocery, that will be the 2 key areas that we looked at and felt there was a good opportunity to protect margins, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. From our perspective on working capital, certainly, some of the year-over-year variance would be things that we would expect to maintain because we are seeing continued higher inflation on inventory. And as we called out, we're expecting as we improve in-stock levels as we have that some of that will be sticky. \n We would look at some of the payables and receivables timing impact and would expect that to be coming back. In fact, if we look at our cash at the end of the first period, the first month of the new year, it was actually up by $1 billion and back in line with the prior year, which obviously wasn't the case at the year-end. So we do think some of it was timing and will flow through. But obviously, we have strong plans for the year in terms of continuing to grow with our partners. And I would focus more on -- from our perspective, how we make sure we're continuing to drive free cash flow, and we feel good about our ability to do that. We didn't give exact numbers. I would also say, Ken, the forward buying would be a smaller part of the number, the timing of payments would be a bigger part of that than the actual forward buying. Yes. I think I would say we try to guide to what we think is a more normalized year in 2023, Ken. Part of it, I would say we probably are being a little bit conservative because of -- we want to see how this unwind of COVID exactly plays out. A couple of examples would be if inflation does remain at high levels, obviously, that could impact inventory but also as we kind of unwind accruals on things like incentive payments, assuming we're more going to be more like an on-target incentive payment than significantly higher than on-target payout, those things can create some 1-year adjustments, too. \n So there's a few areas that just kind of create a few wrinkles. And candidly, we're trying to be conservative to make sure we can see the flow-through of the catch-up from 2022 as well. So we feel we tried -- what we tried to do is take a conservative view of a normalized environment, but there is still some, I would say, unwinding that we wanted to make sure we understood as we reported out in 2023. Yes, I think it'd be fair to say our internal goal would be higher than what we shared because we do believe it's one opportunity, but we thought it was appropriate to be conservative in the circumstances. Yes. Thanks, Spencer. So I think as we mentioned in our prepared comments, we do believe that fuel margins will be sustained at a higher level than the historical averages. We think there's been some structural changes in that industry as you look at the last 5 years that would cause us to think that margins will be maintained at a higher level than historical levels. All that being said though, we do think -- I think I mentioned it in one of the questions earlier that we would think that fuel profitability somewhere between $200 million to $250 million headwind in 2023, largely not because we don't think that there's a continued sort of sustainability in fuel margins. But if you remember last year, when the war in Ukraine was announced, there were some real volatility in prices. And we think some of those shocks that happened around those times generally don't get repeated and cycle. So it's really allowing some of those sort of onetime unusual spikes in pricing or changes in pricing. But fundamentally, we believe fuel will be sustained at high levels. Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, [ Kate ]. Yes, we certainly believe that we -- it's a bit like our overall approach to taking cost out of the business. We started out saying, how do we make sure we're as efficient as we can be and then really become, I think, part of the culture and part of the capability in the organization and the team is working together, I'd say it's across merchandising, operations, supply chain and sourcing, all kind of collaborating on how do we design for value. \n So whether that be, as Rodney mentioned, continuing to make sure we understand the cost that makes the product and build the product and get the product to our stores in a way that we're able to make sure we're being dynamic in negotiating and managing those costs effectively where they change, but it's also about optimizing product design. It's looking at product end-to-end and improving, whether it's packaging or product design and optimizing with customer demand alongside how we can then really match the customer expectations with how we're actually designing the products to really drive the maximum value. And I'd say a bit like the productivity savings, one of those things where every year, we see a road map to additional savings, additional opportunities. And I think that will continue to be the case based on our experience so far. No, I think it ties to the point about there is still uncertainty, so we're making sure that we're allowing for that in our guidance for the year. I would say historically, and you probably or say this before that it's actually very difficult to find a correlation between SNAP in the market and spend on food at home because typically, it tends to impact more discretionary spend. But I think our view was that we've never really had a point in time where we've had so much SNAP dollars in the market. So we believe most of the models that we've looked at for the last 30 years are kind of difficult to say, well, they hold true in this environment. So we felt it was important to be conservative given that we are in a unique time. Yes. Thanks for the question, Kelly. I think from our perspective, we feel that we have to be agile, and we're certainly shooting in our guidance that we'll be continuing to invest in value for the customer. I think one of the things that we believe has changed somewhat during the COVID environment is the situation of how the customer shops and engages with you is different. And what I mean by that is many more customers are engaged digitally, which gives us the ability to truly be able to personalize and bring together all the different pieces. So it's less about just what you see when you enter the store, it's about the fuel rewards that we can target for that customer. It's the personalized digital coupons. \n It's the Our Brands offers that, as Rodney mentioned earlier, can save the customer 10% on an equivalent basket if they decide to shift to some of those products. So we believe we've learned a lot through the pandemic of how do you really channel those dollars in the most effective way, and that's what gives us the confidence that as we think about the rest of the year. We'll continue to invest in value for the customer, but that we can do that even more effectively than the past to make sure that we stretch those dollars further to deliver value for our customers. No..."

McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong results. powered by our strategy of leading with fresh and accelerating with digital. Our associates continue to create a seamless customer experience, delivering fresh and affordable food anytime, anywhere with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience.\n Our associates' incredible dedication means we have momentum entering the fourth quarter and we are continuing to consistently deliver a full fresh and friendly experience for our customers throughout the busy holiday season. It is clear that inflation remains top of mind for our customers and for our company. We are laser focused on helping our customers by providing fresh and affordable food.\n Research shows cooking at home is still 3x to 4x less expensive than dining out. And we are seeing more customers engage with our brands as a way to stretch their food budgets without compromising on quality. During the quarter, we continue to see many of the same shopping trends we observed throughout the year.\n In addition to higher engagement with our brands products, Customers are downloading and redeeming digital coupons and continuing to showcase their cooking at home skills learned during the pandemic. Our breadth of choices, quality of fresh products and the value of our personalized promotions are helping customers navigate the current environment, and our customer-focused approach is working.\n We continue to see overall household growth and significant loyal household growth, which drives a meaningful portion of our sales volume. We are proud to serve as America's grocer, especially during the holiday season. As friends and family come together, we look forward to providing our customers the perfect ingredients to create cherished memories. At a time when 48% of customers have told us they plan to cut back on their Thanksgiving celebration due to inflation. We took action and made sure Thanksgiving was enjoyable and memorable for everyone. To do that, we introduced an easy guide for customers to build an affordable meal of our brand's products with all of the Thanksgiving favorites that a family could enjoy for as little as $5 a person. This is just one example of how we create amazing quality at a great price when it matters most to our customers.\n We empower our customers to create lasting food memories by consistently executing against our go-to-market strategy, focused on Fresh, Our Brands, personalization and our seamless ecosystem. Fresh remains important in today's environment, and we are committed to bringing the freshest products to our customers' tables. Our Fresh for Everyone strategy is grounded in keeping products fresher, longer. Our end-to-end Fresh initiative is transforming these efforts. At the end of quarter 3, we have a total of 1,252 certified stores. At these locations, we see higher fresh sales and identical store sales. With these impressive results, we continue to roll out the initiative nationwide. As part of our end-to-end fresh initiative is our supply chain, where we continue to invest and enhance operations. We are improving productivity and maximizing our fleet by controlling more product movement across our network. Most importantly, we are using our data and science to maximize freshness for our customers.\n Beyond our end-to-end Fresh program, we are bringing more Fresh products to our customers. During the quarter, Home Chef launched new plant-based ready-to-cook meals. They also collaborated with Kroger's in-house dieticians to launch our new simple and nutritious healthy meal kits. Home Chef continues to be an exceptional example of how Kroger's history of mergers help bring new and exciting capabilities to meet our customers' changing needs across the country.\n Turning to Our Brands. We delivered another strong quarter in Our Brands with identical sales growth that outpaced overall identical sales. This was led by our Kroger and Private Selection brands. Customers continue to engage with the Our Brands portfolio, which offers high-quality products at affordable prices. Our Brands products are loved by every member of the family, including the pets. This quarter, we saw tremendous growth in our pet food brands as families continue to treat their dogs and their cats. As you know, they're like a member of the family. We continue to expand and diversify Our Brands portfolio at every price point. After launching Smart Way as our opening price point brand last quarter, we introduced several new Smart Way products this quarter and plan to roll out additional products next quarter. These products are meeting the needs of our customers on a budget, and we've already seen 2 million households to purchase Smart Way products.\n In regard to personalization, our customers are looking for opportunities to save on the products they love. Our loyalty programs and personalized promotions allow them to do just that. We continue to use our leading data science capabilities to develop unique customer insights and offer targeted promotions on the products we know they love. This strategy is driving digital engagement with digital coupon downloads, 32% higher than last year. We anticipate these interactions will continue through the holidays with customers expected to realize more than $200 million in savings from our highly personalized digital offers.\n Moving on to Seamless. We're improving our Seamless experience that brings our customers fresh products anytime, anywhere with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience. We saw back-to-back quarters of strong digital growth led by our delivery solutions. This quarter, we introduced app enhancements that make it easier for customers to engage with our savings and promotion. We launched our first in-app flash sales and enabled our customers to clip digital offers directly from their cart.\n Improving the customer experience is always top of mind for us, and Kroger Pickup now offers 3-hour pickup lead times at all stores in our network, with as little as 1 hour lead time in some areas. We're investing in digital growth initiatives, including expanding our Kroger delivery network in new and existing geographies. We are also growing Boost, our one-of-the-kind membership program. This is the industry's most affordable membership program, and it is foundational to growing our delivery service. We are incredibly pleased with our customer response to Boost as we rolled out the program nationwide earlier this year.\n We continue to invest in our associates as part of our long-term strategy. In addition to investing in average hourly rates this quarter, we enhanced the benefits available to our associates. We expanded the eligibility for our 401(k) plan participants to encourage earlier commitments to lifelong savings, and we took steps to continue supporting working parents by increasing family lead time and our company-sponsored benefit plans. We are excited to celebrate amazing associates this quarter, who were recognized for their outstanding work and commitment to our customers. We were the most recognized employer for Progressive Grocer's GenNext honorees, with 28 of our young leaders recognized for driving change and innovation, both within the organizations and communities they serve.\n Additionally, our KEPASA Hispanic and Latino Associate Resource Group was honored by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce as the Employee Resource Group of the Year.\n In summary, we are building momentum as we close out the year. We are excited to surprise and delight our customers this holiday season with high-quality fresh products at affordable prices. allowing customers to serve on the items that matter most.\n And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary to cover our financial results. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's relentless focus on delivering value for our customers was the foundation of our strong results in quarter 3. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our consistent execution of our go-to-market strategy is resonating the shoppers and driving increased customer loyalty. We were especially pleased with the balance achieved in our results this quarter as we continue to invest in our customers and associates, while also effectively managing costs to achieve solid earnings growth.\n These results provide yet another proof point of the strength of our value creation model and our ability to operate successfully in different environments.\n I'll now provide additional color on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.88 for the quarter, an increase of 13% compared to the same quarter last year. This growth was driven by top line revenue and our disciplined approach to balancing investments with effective cost management.\n Identical sales without fuel grew 6.9%. Our Brands continue to resonate deeply with customers as sales grew 10.4%. The outstanding quality and value offered by these exclusive Kroger products is an important differentiator in our go-to-market strategy, and this is especially true during periods of high inflation. As we shared at our Investor Day in March, Our Brands products are margin accretive and represent a key pillar in our strategy to grow profitability while also delivering greater value for customers.\n Digital sales grew 10% during the quarter with delivery solutions leading the way, up 34% year-over-year. Delivery solutions includes the Kroger delivery network powered by Ocado delivery from our stores via Kroger and third-party platforms and our convenience offering, Kroger Delivery Now. Our industry-leading Net Promoter Scores in Kroger Delivery are driving new customer engagement and best-in-class retention rates.\n Gross margin was 21.4% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 5 basis points compared to the same period last year. This result reflected our team's ability to effectively manage higher product cost inflation and shrink through strong sourcing practices while also helping customers manage their budgets and keeping prices competitive.\n During the quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $152 million compared to $93 million in the prior year. This was primarily driven by higher product cost inflation in grocery. We still expect to see some moderation in inflation during our fourth quarter as we cycle higher inflation from a year ago.\n Kroger's operating general and administrative rates decreased 3 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items compared to the same period last year. The decrease in OG&A rate was driven by sales leverage and execution of cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by investments in our associates. We continue to identify opportunities to remove cost from our business without affecting the customer experience and are on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings.\n Kroger Health had another successful quarter, delivering higher-than-expected sales and profitability despite cycling the impact of higher COVID vaccine revenue from a year ago. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in health care, and our Kroger Health team remains committed to ensuring our customers obtain medically necessary prescriptions.\n Recently, we announced that we are terminating our Express Scripts agreement for commercial customers as of December 31. The Express Scripts contract would have required Kroger to fill our customers' prescriptions below our cost of operation, something we could not accept as we aim to keep our prices low for customers during this inflationary period. We expect this contract termination will reduce sales by about $100 million in Kroger's fiscal fourth quarter, impacting identical sales without fuel for the quarter by approximately 35 basis points. This decision is not expected to have an impact on operating profit or EPS.\n Included in our results for the quarter is an $85 million pretax charge related to the settlement of all opioid litigation claims with the State of New Mexico. This amount was excluded from our adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS results to reflect the unique and nonrecurring nature of the charge. This settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability by Kroger, and we will continue to vigorously defend against other claims and lawsuits related to opioids.\n This settlement is based on a unique set of circumstances and facts related to New Mexico, and Kroger does not believe that the settlement amount or any other terms of our agreement with New Mexico can or should be extrapolated to any other opioid-related cases pending against Kroger. It is our view that this settlement is not a reliable proxy for the outcome of any other cases or the overall level of Kroger's exposure.\n Currently, Kroger has 2 active matters pending in West Virginia and Texas scheduled for trial in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Kroger continues to believe that the claims are without merit, and that it has strong defenses to these claims. Kroger is also differently situated from many of the other defendants in these cases. Our pharmacy operations have a much smaller footprint, both in terms of the size of the business, and market share with respect to opioids, and we are proud of the outstanding work performed by our associates in delivering critical care and services to our pharmacy customers.\n Turning now to alternative profit businesses, which are a fast-growing and key part of our value creation model. The traffic and data generated by our supermarket business continues to create a flywheel effect for alternative profits and growth this quarter was again led by retail media. CPG brands are finding significant value in our unique ability to build custom audiences that draw on our data to deliver precisely measured return on investment.\n Last month, KPM added a new channel to its suite of retail media solutions, welcoming Snapchat into the portfolio. Advertisers are now able to use Kroger's proprietary capabilities to optimize Snapchat's immersive ad formats. We are constantly innovating to expand our reach, and KPM recently increased its programmatic advertising marketplace capabilities to include video and one of the fastest-growing digital media sectors, connected TV. These new frontiers will provide exciting future growth opportunities for KPN.\n Fuel is an important part of our overall value proposition, and our fuel rewards program remains a key differentiator to help customers stretch their dollars during a period of high inflation. Fuel rewards engagement remained high during the third quarter and led to gallon sales, which outpaced the market. The average retail fuel price was $3.84 this quarter, versus $3.24 in the same quarter last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.50 compared to $0.42 in the same quarter in 2021.\n The results we reported today would not have been possible without our incredible associates who continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and delivering a full, fresh and friendly experience for our customers. We have a long track record of investing in our associates and are committed to continuing these investments to ensure Kroger remains an employer of choice. Building on $1.2 billion of incremental investments since 2018 we have raised our average hourly rates by over 5% so far in 2022.\n During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Columbus, Las Vegas, Chicago, Fort Wayne and pharmacists in Southern California, covering more than 28,000 associates. During the fourth quarter, we have also ratified new labor agreements for associates in Toledo and Nashville, as well as the Teamsters master agreement.\n Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. During the quarter, cash flow was affected by increased inventory balances. This was predominantly due to higher product cost inflation, particularly in grocery, in stocks improving to pre-pandemic levels and forward buying of inventory in pharmacy. We are comfortable that our current level and mix of inventory is appropriate to support our future sales expectations and would expect to see an improvement in working capital during the fourth quarter.\n Regarding capital expenditures, we are committed to investing in the business to support our go-to-market strategy and continue to see many opportunities to drive future growth. As shared last quarter, various initiatives have been delayed due to supply constraints, and we now expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in 2022.\n The net effect of higher inventory and lower capital expenditures for the year is that we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2022. \n In closing, I'd like to share additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. The Kroger team's consistent execution of our go-to-market strategy continues to build momentum in our business and gives us the confidence to again raise our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 5.1% to 5.3%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $4.05 to $4.15, representing growth of 10% to 13% over 2021.\n This guidance assumes a LIFO charge of approximately $500 million for the full year, which represents a $300 million headwind over the 2021 LIFO charge. Our third quarter and year-to-date results highlight the strength of Kroger's value creation model, which has proven to be resilient in different operating environments. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns, and we look forward to sharing detailed 2023 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call in March.\n And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. The results we've shared with you today are a testament to our business model strength and agility to support our customers in all economic environments. This is made possible because of the hard work and dedication of our incredible associates. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide a brief update on our pending merger with Albertsons. As you may know, I had the opportunity and Vivek did as well to testify before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights this week. I shared with the senators that our merger will lower prices for customers starting day 1, continued investments in our associates and stores and customer experience and do even more in our communities than either company can do alone. We believe this merger will allow us to fulfill these commitments to our customers, our associates and our communities well into the future.\n We are making early progress on our integration planning as expected and we continue to engage with all of our stakeholders and regulators. We are advancing our road map to close the transaction in early 2024. We look forward to working with the regulators as they review the transaction and do not have a substantial update at this time. We would ask that you focus your questions on our quarterly performance and our progress on our strategy.\n With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  And our first question today go to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. \nMichael Montani: Just wanted to follow up on 2 fronts. One was into the fourth quarter guide, it appears that ID sales could be up around 4%. I just wanted to understand the deceleration there. Was that predominantly inflation and/or the Express Scripts? Or is there anything else to note? Can you share any start to the quarter information? And then I had a follow-up. \nW. McMullen: Yes. I'll start and let Gary finish it. Part of it is just cycling inflation from a year ago. We are beginning to now cycle the higher inflation a year ago. Gary, with that, I'll let you get into a little bit more asset specific. \nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney. And maybe just to confirm, so the trend in the early part of the fourth quarter has continued consistent with how we're performing in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, is continued consistent with outperformance in the third quarter. Michael, as to one part of your question there. \n I think the other piece is, Michael, yes, I think you captured them well is, as Rodney mentioned, we do believe this recycle higher inflation in the final quarter of 2021. We expect that to have some impact on the overall year-over-year growth in food at home during the fourth quarter. And obviously, we'll all see how that plays out.\n And then secondly, we have factored in the impact of the ESI, the Express Scripts contract termination as well for January. So overall, I think if you kind of take our full year guidance, we'd be guiding between 4% and 5% IDs for the final quarter of the year. \nMichael Montani: Got it. And then just a follow-up on the margin implications. It looks like those could be flat to down slightly in the fourth quarter. So I just want to understand how do you see the competitive environment evolving? And then any cost initiatives that you could share with us there? \nW. McMullen: Relative to the competitive environment, we continue to see it pretty similar to how it's been throughout the year. all retailers are doing everything they can to minimize the impact on inflation to customers the best you can do. And we obviously would use our personalized and promotions that are directly focused on individual households because of things we know they love to try to help people stretch their budget. We're also, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, seeing customers continuing to move to our brands. And in the past, what we find is when customers move to Our Brands, that's very, very sticky because the high quality of the product and the satisfaction there. So what we find is even when things are getting normalized, Our Brands come out of that at a higher penetration level than going in, which is long term good for our business as well. With that, Gary, I'll let you get into. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Just a couple of bits of extra color, Michael, on the fourth quarter for you. As you probably gathered from the guidance, it would be a lowest quarter for year-over-year growth in what we shared for EPS. I think a few things to bear in mind there. First of all, we'll be cycling the strongest quarter from last year. Last year's EPS growth in Q4 '21 was the highest growth that we had during the year. So we're cycling higher growth from prior year. We'd assume fuel margins will be flat during the fourth quarter. So no real headwind or tailwind there, where, as you know, fuel has been a tailwind for us in the last couple of quarters.\n And of course, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, year-over-year, LIFO will be around $100 million headwind in the fourth quarter of EPS because you may recall again that LIFO was only $20 million last fourth quarter. when we finalize the calculations. So that would be factors to bear in mind when you think about our EPS guidance. The only other thing I might mention is that you've heard me talk about on this call in previous quarters that when you look at our rolling 4 quarter sort of gross margin investment, somewhere between 10 and 20 basis points and OG&A leverage of 10, 20 basis points similarly to keep the business in balance. I would say that because we're cycling Q4 last year gross margin was relatively flat, and OG&A was relatively flat. So I would say you should probably expect our gross margin investment will be a little bit north of the 10 to 20 basis points in Q4, but our OG&A leverage should also be north of that 10 to 20 basis points as well. \nOperator: And the next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. \nCharles Cerankosky: Nice quarter. If you could talk a little bit about which categories did worse than inflation in terms of unit growth in which we're stronger on managing a lot of that was in the general merchandise. And also, Gary, could you comment on why identical sales growth, ex fuel was better than total sales growth ex-fuel? \nW. McMullen: Yes. In terms of the categories, the one you identified definitely would be the weaker category in terms of general merchandise. And that would be true at the Fred Meyer division, it would also be true across the rest of the organization as well. We continue to do well in those categories relative to the market. Our teams have done a great job of making sure they've been managing inventories relative to where the expectations themselves.\n The other categories that would be weaker than the total would be categories where we continue to have supply chain disruptions. Gary and I both mentioned, overall supply chain is getting better, but we still have categories like cat food, dog food, baby formula some of those types of cold remedies, some of those areas continue to have some supply chain issues as well. With the identicals, Gary, go on. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Chuck. Yes, the biggest part of that, in fact, pretty much all of it, Chuck, would be -- you may recall at the start of the year, we shared that we've made the decision to stop dispensing certain drugs in our specialty pharmacy business because it didn't really tie to overall customer loyalty in our broader business, and it isn't profitable business for us. So we made that decision at the start of the year, and we adjust that out of our ID. So it's a like-for-like comparison, but it does create a disconnect between total sales and identical sales.\n One of those examples is actually helping gross margin as well as we're making those decisions to make sure we're optimizing the balance of the business. \nOperator: And the next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Gary, I'd like to ask you about the dynamic between the LIFO charge and the FIFO gross margin going forward. There's -- the FIFO gross margin have been good. And this year, there's probably $0.50 a share or more, I guess, in the LIFO charge in terms of the headwind. I mean assuming inflation eases, you get much of that LIFO charge back.\n Do we just add that back to earnings? Or is there a dynamic to consider when we think about the FIFO gross margin? Presumably, some of this probably still needs to be priced. I'm just kind of curious, is the FIFO gross margin performance that we've seen, can you sustain that when the LIFO charge eases next year? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. I think as you heard as mentioned on the call, we probably won't get into a lot of detail around 2023 guidance because we'd rather put it into context of the full picture for next year. As you might imagine, there'll be a lot of moving parts as we sort of bridge to share that color with you when we get to March next year.\n I think overall, though, certainly, some of the elements that you talked about are going to be key factors when you think about what will be at play as you think about 2023, if I kind of talk more in general themes. I think overall, I would say we feel good to answer your question about gross margin that we are very focused on -- and I think are proven for our model, but there are levers that we can pull to manage costs and sourcing effectively to improve mix over time with some of the momentum in our brands and the opportunities continue to accelerate fresh performance and innovation.\n So there are a number of areas when we look at the balancing gross margin that we believe we would expect there to be longer-term stability and our ability to manage that. I think when you look specifically at the moving parts for next year, I think there's going to be a lot of factors that will come into play as you think about next year.\n You're right in terms of if inflation normalizes and your numbers certainly correct around the $500 million impact this year, which would be a $300 million year-over-year headwind because last year's LIFO was also inflated as inflation started to rise in quarter 4 last year. If you remember, our LIFO charge is calculated at a very specific week of the year, even though we try and estimate it throughout the year.\n So we would believe that as we'll get into guidance next year, obviously, when we share our earnings, and we're still sort of forming views around what we think will happen with inflation, but we're probably looking at most of the external views that you are and most of the analysts' reports that we can look at in the USDA, et cetera, would be in that sort of more of that 2.5% to 3-or-so percent inflation for next year. We'll obviously provide more color on what we believe, but that's sort of where most of the data that we see tend to be pointing towards. \nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Fuel margins have been really strong. I mean there's been -- some of your peers in the industry have talked about that moderating next year? I'm just kind of curious as to whether you share that view and how we should be thinking about modeling that going forward? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think again, I'll maybe just broaden it because again, I think it's a little bit dangerous to pick on one element of the model for next year. I do think that fuel margins have had obviously a very good run. And generally, I think margins are improving over time, but there is -- there has been in the last 2 years, some major volatility in shocks in the market. I think it's hard to see those being cycled. So you look at margins earlier in this year, and I think that's likely to be a headwind next year in looking at the fuel profitability.\n But again, I think you mentioned LIFO, another example for us would be -- as you look at our incentive plan, obviously, we're having a very strong year versus our expectations, having raised our guidance every quarter. So you get to more of a normalized incentive plan next year, assuming the budgets kind of your expected payout.\n We continue to take costs out of our business and find new ways to improve leverage in the model. It has been 5 years, as you know, journey for us. We believe supply chain and alternative profits are potential tailwinds next year as we continue to improve efficiency in supply chain and all profit continues to grow.\n So I think there's a lot of moving parts. And again, rather than sort of trying to bridge you to how all those play out. I think that's going to be a balance of puts and takes. And obviously, we're looking forward to sharing a lot more color when we get to March next year. \nW. McMullen: Yes. I think when you look at Gary's points overall, it's one of the things that's so important about our overall business model because we do have a lot of moving parts, and we've invested a ton of work and effort our whole team has over the last several years to reinvent the business model and make sure the business model can be successful in every economic environment. And to me, Gary's point that he was sharing really highlight that as we look forward. \nOperator: And the next question goes to Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital. \nScott Mushkin: So the first thing I wanted to -- so the first thing I wanted to get some answers to a little bit is the market share, you guys market share. It seems to have stabilized, maybe even growing a little bit. Do you agree? And what do you think is leading to that? \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at market share, the trends continue to improve, and we feel good about where we are, but we're not satisfied with where we are. We believe the work that we're doing on Fresh is a key part of driving that.\n And obviously, just the continued personalization and making sure that we have a customer experience for its household to household type relationship. And then Our Brands always shines when an economic environment gets a little tougher. So it's really those things working together.\n And then our store teams continuing to do a good job of improving on friendliness. And I make that comment based on what customers tell us how we're doing, not just my opinion of how we're doing. \nScott Mushkin: Great. And then my second question is a little bit more short term. I mean we've heard some retailers, not necessarily in the food industry, but some retailers that the consumers behave or kind of changed somewhat abruptly as we work through the fall. I mean, is that something you guys have seen? And if yes, do you think it's started to leak into the competitive environment? \nW. McMullen: Yes. It's a great question, Scott. And when we talk to our customers, they're telling us they're changing. But so far, they're changing on purchases other than food. So it's -- they are still prioritizing food. It gets a little bit back to one of the comments I made. It's still 3x or 4x cheaper to eat at home versus going out to a restaurant and so many more people have learned how to cook.\n So if you look at the behavior changes other than the movement to our brands and being much more aggressive on downloading digital coupons and engaging with some of our promotional offers. That's really the only behavior we've seen in our business outside of the comment I made earlier on our general business, but that's a much smaller part of our business than many of our competitors. \nScott Mushkin: And the competitive environment, has it changed? \nW. McMullen: No. It's all -- as you know, it's any place you look across the country, you'll see it in different stages. And -- but overall, what we see is pretty similar to what -- how it's been. \nOperator: And the next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. \nJohn Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with a big picture here. When do you guys think about -- because you've got the data, if you think about growth in households, right? So if you're going to comp, let's say, I don't know, 3% or 4% longer term, household growth would be what of that and comp growth with comp households would be what? How do you think about that? And then when you -- is there any way for you to dive into your penetration, right, with your deciles and where the biggest opportunity is? \nW. McMullen: I will start and then Gary, please add any color you want. But if you look long term, we always build our business model around 1% to 2% inflation. And if you -- as you know, any given year will be different than that. But longer term, we've always felt that, that's kind of where fundamental inflation will be. Obviously, over the last couple of years, it's been completely different than that.\n As I shared in my prepared remarks, our oil household growth was very strong this quarter, and it's been moving in the right direction. When customers first become a loyal household, what we find is, over time, we get a higher share of that household growth. And we really are seeing that what we define as our seamless experience where a customer can engage with us where we deliver, where they pick up in store and shop in store, it's that combination together that earns us the right.\n So as our loyal household grows, we get a higher share and that should be a tailwind to our identical sales growth over time. And that was the reason that we talked about it, and it's something, internally, we spend a lot of energy on it. And I know, Gary, is there any other color that you think would be helpful for people to understand. \nGary Millerchip: I think you covered it well, Rodney. I guess the only couple of extra points, John, I would maybe add, I do think, as you know, our core strategy is to grow existing loyal customers and what was really pleasing in the quarter as we saw 2.5% growth in loyal customers. So we're seeing customers move through the loyalty curve, and that's always been carry the strategy to really deeply reward customers and grow that relationship.\n I think what we're also seeing though is that as Rodney mentioned, we're building that Seamless capability with digital, we are starting to now attract a larger number of households too and the investments we're making in digital are creating that capacity to grow households as well.\n I think the one thing on the loyal house, as I would say, too, is what we saw during the quarter have seen the last couple of quarters is that maybe that more affluent customer that has shopped maybe a larger number of retailers before that's consolidated more of their trips and total basket with Kroger as they may not need to adjust their budget because of inflation, but they feel it's the sensible and responsible thing to do, and they see Kroger as a great place to get the right quality at a great value as well, and we're seeing that consolidation happen. \nJohn Heinbockel: And just one more quick thing. Just conceptually, I know you don't want to talk about anything beyond this year, but right? You've raised the EBIT guide quite a bit right now you're up in the high 4s. When you look at '22, what was in there, maybe the good guys and the bad guys that kind of work against each other. I'm sort of wondering how sustainable is that new level of profitability? Again granted, the margin is not up as much as the dollars are. How do you think about that in terms of how representative of that performance is and what goes and comes next year off the P&L from this year? \nW. McMullen: John, as you know, we manage our business on dollars. And for us, growing dollars is what creates a sustainable business model long term. And we always view that the better offer that we can be able to afford to give to our customers the more sustainable that is, and the only way we can do that is by managing our costs and continuing to find and identify areas of waste so that we can reduce that and fund that.\n Fundamentally, as you look at Kroger, we still would have that same strategy and we'd still expect that over time because what we find is that really connects well with the customers. We -- that allows us the capacity to continue to invest in our associates and support our communities. And when we do those 3 things right, the shareholders benefit.\n So I know broad picture, that's what we would do, the way we look at things. And obviously, with everything we do, we try to make sure we're doing it in a way that's sustainable long periods of time. \nOperator: And the next question goes to Kenneth B. Goldman of JP Morgan Chase. \nKenneth Goldman: It's important to list my little initial [indiscernible] I'm just curious, the -- it's the second quarter in a row that you've lowered your CapEx guidance. I understand why you've been clear about that. And as Rob Moskow pointed out last quarter, you're not the only company to feel that pressure. I'm curious though, at what point is it reasonable for us to not be concerned, but sort of be aware of the potential impact on your growth from not being able to expand in a way that you'd like. I'm just curious how it affects anything in the near term, if at all? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Ken. For us, I don't think it's really something that we're concerned about. We obviously did have very ambitious plans for CapEx this year, playing some catch-up from last year. And we still believe the projects that we have on the horizon are going to be generating significant value for the company in the future and support our growth plans.\n But when we looked at the expectations for the rest of the year, there are a number of large projects, whether it's in supply chain or some of the stores, just where it's just taking longer to get them completed or there are some costs where it just makes sense to pause for a period of time and reintroduce when we believe that those costs will be more rational.\n So from our perspective, we don't look at it as having a major impact on our growth model. As you know, we kind of historically were at sort of that $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion of CapEx spend a year. We've moved it up to $3.5 billion, being our sort of target range. And I would still say that's probably directionally where we'd want to be long term, to be pushing to the top end of our TSR model.\n So we do believe it's important to be investing in the business, and we can still see plenty of opportunities to support that growth, but we just thought it was based on how long it's taking with certain things to get projects completed with supply availability that we think it's going to be a -- some of those projects will now blend into 2023, but we don't have a concern today about it impacting our growth algorithm. \nKenneth Goldman: Got it. And then Rodney, I very much respect your request for us not to ask about the transaction. I won't ask about it. But I am curious, is there a plan ahead to sort of have give updates to investors on a separate kind of form just because it's obviously such a big part of the story from here. I think people don't want a black hole or a vacuum of news. So I'm just curious what the plan is to kind of update investors on progress? Is it just you'll let us know during each quarter what's new and that's kind of it. And then we won't have any Q&A around that. I'm just trying to get a sense of that kind of news flow from here. \nW. McMullen: Yes, it's a great question, Ken. And it's something that we're going to obviously manage in a very transparent way. And we wanted to go ahead and include it in this quarter, just the context of what is new, and that's what we've shared.\n If there was something material, we would share it between quarters. But in all likelihood in the foreseeable future updates would be on a quarterly basis. But if it was something material -- what we try to do on disclosure is if our roles were reversed, what is it that we think it would be helpful for someone to know, and that's what we always try to do. So -- and obviously, feel free to give us feedback when that doesn't feel right to you because we appreciate the feedback. \nOperator: And the next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Rodney, why wouldn't the grocery sector being more competitive and see more price competition in 2023 given that the consumer is going to be under pressure there's going to be your competitors who are going to want to try and gain some share given the potential distraction from the uncertainty of the merger with Albertsons? Many consumable retailers will have this LIFO gross margin benefit into '23, and there's going to be disinflation where at times, it could be easier to make price investments in an environment of disinflation than it is when there is an inflation. \nW. McMullen: Yes. It really gets back to overall. I think it's incredibly important to understand that we connect with the customer in multiple ways, and Fresh is a critical component of that. We fundamentally assume over time, the market is going to get more competitive. We've done that for 25 years. We'll continue to do that. And that's the reason why we put so much investment energy on personalizing experiences, supporting our associates in ways -- any way we can, pay, continue in education, even additional support on mental health and especially in today's environment.\n And what we have found in every environment by supporting and connecting with the customer from a full fresh and friendly experience and then having good prices and very aggressive promotion and then personalizing the experience, we're able to support the customer.\n One of the things that also supports gross margin as we continue to expect larger growth in our Fresh departments, which have higher margins in center store. And then when you look at our alternative profit businesses and some of those businesses have margins better than what the center store would be. So for us, it's -- you really have to look at all of those things together and look at those things over time, and we feel really good about the business model that we continue to develop and grow at our company. \nMichael Lasser: Understood. And my follow-up question is on the outlook for inflation. What are you hearing right now from your vendor can be about their desire to raise prices into 2023. Gary, you said previously that there will be -- or some of the prognostications are for 2.5% to 3% food at home inflation next year.\n If you were to not raise another price from here, how much inflation benefit would Kroger experienced in 2023 just from the wraparound effect of what you've already raised this year? And then when you meant to 2.5% to 3%, would it be another 2.5% to 3% on top of that? \nW. McMullen: Well, I'll make a couple of comments, and Gary, you can think about some of the specifics. If you look at in our fresh departments, clearly, inflation is slowing down in many categories. Chicken would be an example. You're starting to see that in some of the other categories as well. And I always make the comment high inflation solves high inflation because farmers produce more when their margins improve.\n If you look at on CPG companies themselves, right now, it's kind of mixed. Some CPG companies are willing -- much willing to have higher prices and give up growth. And what we find is when CPGs do that, our brand is so strong, we really gained share. And that helps the customers budget and it also improves the stickiness and the loyalty of that customer as well. So it's -- what do they always say, all short statements and economics are wrong. And I really think you have to look at all the moving parts. I don't know, Gary, anything else you want to add to Michael's inflation? \nGary Millerchip: Yes, I think you covered it well, Rodney. I think Michael, as Rodney mentioned, we're seeing that Fresh is certainly starting to see some change in trajectory on inflation. So I think it is the grocery category that's the most stubborn if you like, in terms of where it's holding in inflation at the moment. And as Rodney said, I think from -- as we look forward from our perspective, if that were to continue without being sort of supported by true cost increases, then that creates an opportunity for us with our brands to improve margin and grow share over time. So I think that's the way we think about it in general. \nOperator: And the next question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. \nKelly Bania: Kelly Bania from BMO. Just a couple of simple questions. I guess, as we think about the comp here or the IDs in the back half, can you just help us understand how much inflation drove the upside there versus tonnage or -- you talked quite a bit about your fresh initiative. Is it those stores? Just helping us understand where the upside is coming from?\n And then on top of that, we often talk on the food service side of the industry about volume and tonnage, I guess, is the way you talk about it relative to 2019. And I'm just curious if you can help us understand where you are in terms of volume or tonnage, however you think about that relative to 2019 levels at this point? \nW. McMullen: Gary, I'll let you talk about the -- a little color on the IDs and then on the foodservice after you finish Health. I share some things there. \nGary Millerchip: Okay. Great. Kelly, I think overall, we mentioned it in their prepared remarks somewhat as well. We've seen inflation starting to level. It's still obviously at very heightened levels. But if you look at the trend quarter-over-quarter, it really narrowed down to less than 1% increase in inflation in our Q3 versus our Q2.\n So what we were pleased about was in that context, the continued momentum in our overall ID sales when we look at our Q3 performance versus our Q2, and I think a lot of that ties to some of the prepared remarks that Rodney also shared around household growth that we're seeing and really some of the defying more share of wallet from loyal customers and seeing lower customer growth. So that's the piece that I think we've been the most pleased around.\n And we continue to perform really well with winning that first large basket with customers. We continue to see strong momentum there. And even as customers have continued to adjust their behavior as they kind of wrestle with inflation and decide how to balance budgets, we've been really pleased with how our overall pinning that first basket has continued to maintain strong momentum. \nW. McMullen: Yes. On foodservice, volume would actually be above where we would have been in 2019. For us, when we look at foodservice or food -- we are always -- I never know quite what to call it other than it's a great meal, easy to cook, easy to heat up, easy to assemble. It was the reason why strategically we merged with Home Chef because we thought Home Chef on its own had great trends and could continue to grow.\n We also felt like their capabilities we could leverage back into Kroger to further improve our mill pit and a great restaurant quality meals would be an example. If you look at sushi, we're the largest sushi restaurant in the United States as an example. Obviously, we partner with a lot of third parties and local entrepreneurs on that, sandwiches and all those things.\n So we see food service as an important component of our growth, not so much relative to 2023. But as you start looking out at, say, 2025 and beyond, and being -- having an amazing quality meal that's easy and leveraging our delivery network or pickup network is an important part of the growth as you look longer term. \nOperator: Next question is Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: I just had one question just on OG&A leverage. So this quarter, there was minimal leverage on a very strong comp, and that appears to be driven by wage pressures. So as you look forward to next year, just any insight in terms of how you guys are thinking about wage crushers at this juncture and whether you think the OG&A leverage point could be lower? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Rupesh, thanks for the question. Maybe just a little bit more color on Q3 and Q4 as well because I think there's a little bit more to the story there as well that's worth understanding. I would say that certainly, you're right, the -- we saw a lot of benefit from sales leverage and productivity improvements during the quarter.\n The team did a great job in really managing costs, considering the inflation that we're facing in some of those cost areas. We would have also had higher incentive plan costs year-over-year in quarter higher technology costs. We're investing in a number of areas that we're seeing growth in year-over-year. And some of that is maybe flipping from capital to operating expense because as you move more to cloud-based activity.\n It just -- it does change the mix there as well. And we also invested, as we did in Q2 in some consultants and some advisory work to help build future momentum in the growth. So I would say the underlying improvement in productivity was stronger than the quarter would have suggested, and we feel good about the ability to leverage OG&A and fund the average hourly rate increases that we're seeing.\n In fact, as I mentioned earlier, the Q4 number as we're cycling a fairly flat OG&A rate in Q4, we would expect to be north of 20 basis points of leverage in the fourth quarter this year as we head into next year. \nOperator: And the next question is our final question to Robert S. Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nKendall Toscano: This is Kendall Toscano on for Robbie. I just wanted to see if you could give any more color on how traffic looked during the quarter. What kind of trends you're seeing with items in the basket and number of trips to the store? And then, I guess, as you're expecting inflation to moderate a little bit in the fourth quarter, what you would expect on those items going forward? \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the overall trends in traffic, it continues to be improving. Obviously, the overall basket itself is heavily driven by inflation. But as I mentioned earlier, our trends on market share are moving in the right direction and continue to go in the right direction. In terms of the last part, I don't know, Gary, on inflation? \nGary Millerchip: I think probably similar to what we shared earlier, I think overall, as we're looking at the way the customer is changing behavior, as Rodney mentioned, trips improving, generally fairly consistent, I would say, over the year, but we are seeing higher trips from those loyal shoppers that have traditionally shopped in many different retailers for different categories and now seeing that trip consolidate to Kroger. I think is an important trend that we've seen throughout the year and continue to accelerate in the third quarter. \nW. McMullen: Yes. Gary, I think that's a great point, and thanks for the questions. And for everyone, thank you for joining us today. As always, I always like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in because so many of our associates take the time to do that, which we appreciate. This is the time of year we truly shine.\n Our special holiday film made clear. We create the opportunity for our customers to transform today's holiday moments into tomorrow's memories. We've had the pleasure to hear from countless associates former associates and customers about just how touching this film has been. I know I can't watch it without getting a tear in my eye. And just reminding all of us how special it is to share favorite meals with those we love most.\n Thank you to our teams who put this together. Thank you for our teams who make the memories happen. It's a wonderful way to kick off the holiday season. As we all prepare together with our loved ones, I am so incredibly proud of our associates across the Kroger family of companies. We have accomplished so much this year. Thank you for the many ways you serve our communities and uplift our customers and each other. This concludes our call for today. We wish everyone a happy holiday season. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and encourage you to stay safe. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong results. powered by our strategy of leading with fresh and accelerating with digital. Our associates continue to create a seamless customer experience, delivering fresh and affordable food anytime, anywhere with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience.\n Our associates' incredible dedication means we have momentum entering the fourth quarter and we are continuing to consistently deliver a full fresh and friendly experience for our customers throughout the busy holiday season. It is clear that inflation remains top of mind for our customers and for our company. We are laser focused on helping our customers by providing fresh and affordable food.\n Research shows cooking at home is still 3x to 4x less expensive than dining out. And we are seeing more customers engage with our brands as a way to stretch their food budgets without compromising on quality. During the quarter, we continue to see many of the same shopping trends we observed throughout the year.\n In addition to higher engagement with our brands products, Customers are downloading and redeeming digital coupons and continuing to showcase their cooking at home skills learned during the pandemic. Our breadth of choices, quality of fresh products and the value of our personalized promotions are helping customers navigate the current environment, and our customer-focused approach is working.\n We continue to see overall household growth and significant loyal household growth, which drives a meaningful portion of our sales volume. We are proud to serve as America's grocer, especially during the holiday season. As friends and family come together, we look forward to providing our customers the perfect ingredients to create cherished memories. At a time when 48% of customers have told us they plan to cut back on their Thanksgiving celebration due to inflation. We took action and made sure Thanksgiving was enjoyable and memorable for everyone. To do that, we introduced an easy guide for customers to build an affordable meal of our brand's products with all of the Thanksgiving favorites that a family could enjoy for as little as $5 a person. This is just one example of how we create amazing quality at a great price when it matters most to our customers.\n We empower our customers to create lasting food memories by consistently executing against our go-to-market strategy, focused on Fresh, Our Brands, personalization and our seamless ecosystem. Fresh remains important in today's environment, and we are committed to bringing the freshest products to our customers' tables. Our Fresh for Everyone strategy is grounded in keeping products fresher, longer. Our end-to-end Fresh initiative is transforming these efforts. At the end of quarter 3, we have a total of 1,252 certified stores. At these locations, we see higher fresh sales and identical store sales. With these impressive results, we continue to roll out the initiative nationwide. As part of our end-to-end fresh initiative is our supply chain, where we continue to invest and enhance operations. We are improving productivity and maximizing our fleet by controlling more product movement across our network. Most importantly, we are using our data and science to maximize freshness for our customers.\n Beyond our end-to-end Fresh program, we are bringing more Fresh products to our customers. During the quarter, Home Chef launched new plant-based ready-to-cook meals. They also collaborated with Kroger's in-house dieticians to launch our new simple and nutritious healthy meal kits. Home Chef continues to be an exceptional example of how Kroger's history of mergers help bring new and exciting capabilities to meet our customers' changing needs across the country.\n Turning to Our Brands. We delivered another strong quarter in Our Brands with identical sales growth that outpaced overall identical sales. This was led by our Kroger and Private Selection brands. Customers continue to engage with the Our Brands portfolio, which offers high-quality products at affordable prices. Our Brands products are loved by every member of the family, including the pets. This quarter, we saw tremendous growth in our pet food brands as families continue to treat their dogs and their cats. As you know, they're like a member of the family. We continue to expand and diversify Our Brands portfolio at every price point. After launching Smart Way as our opening price point brand last quarter, we introduced several new Smart Way products this quarter and plan to roll out additional products next quarter. These products are meeting the needs of our customers on a budget, and we've already seen 2 million households to purchase Smart Way products.\n In regard to personalization, our customers are looking for opportunities to save on the products they love. Our loyalty programs and personalized promotions allow them to do just that. We continue to use our leading data science capabilities to develop unique customer insights and offer targeted promotions on the products we know they love. This strategy is driving digital engagement with digital coupon downloads, 32% higher than last year. We anticipate these interactions will continue through the holidays with customers expected to realize more than $200 million in savings from our highly personalized digital offers.\n Moving on to Seamless. We're improving our Seamless experience that brings our customers fresh products anytime, anywhere with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience. We saw back-to-back quarters of strong digital growth led by our delivery solutions. This quarter, we introduced app enhancements that make it easier for customers to engage with our savings and promotion. We launched our first in-app flash sales and enabled our customers to clip digital offers directly from their cart.\n Improving the customer experience is always top of mind for us, and Kroger Pickup now offers 3-hour pickup lead times at all stores in our network, with as little as 1 hour lead time in some areas. We're investing in digital growth initiatives, including expanding our Kroger delivery network in new and existing geographies. We are also growing Boost, our one-of-the-kind membership program. This is the industry's most affordable membership program, and it is foundational to growing our delivery service. We are incredibly pleased with our customer response to Boost as we rolled out the program nationwide earlier this year.\n We continue to invest in our associates as part of our long-term strategy. In addition to investing in average hourly rates this quarter, we enhanced the benefits available to our associates. We expanded the eligibility for our 401(k) plan participants to encourage earlier commitments to lifelong savings, and we took steps to continue supporting working parents by increasing family lead time and our company-sponsored benefit plans. We are excited to celebrate amazing associates this quarter, who were recognized for their outstanding work and commitment to our customers. We were the most recognized employer for Progressive Grocer's GenNext honorees, with 28 of our young leaders recognized for driving change and innovation, both within the organizations and communities they serve.\n Additionally, our KEPASA Hispanic and Latino Associate Resource Group was honored by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce as the Employee Resource Group of the Year.\n In summary, we are building momentum as we close out the year. We are excited to surprise and delight our customers this holiday season with high-quality fresh products at affordable prices. allowing customers to serve on the items that matter most.\n And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary to cover our financial results. Gary? Thanks, Gary. The results we've shared with you today are a testament to our business model strength and agility to support our customers in all economic environments. This is made possible because of the hard work and dedication of our incredible associates. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide a brief update on our pending merger with Albertsons. As you may know, I had the opportunity and Vivek did as well to testify before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights this week. I shared with the senators that our merger will lower prices for customers starting day 1, continued investments in our associates and stores and customer experience and do even more in our communities than either company can do alone. We believe this merger will allow us to fulfill these commitments to our customers, our associates and our communities well into the future.\n We are making early progress on our integration planning as expected and we continue to engage with all of our stakeholders and regulators. We are advancing our road map to close the transaction in early 2024. We look forward to working with the regulators as they review the transaction and do not have a substantial update at this time. We would ask that you focus your questions on our quarterly performance and our progress on our strategy.\n With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions. Yes. I'll start and let Gary finish it. Part of it is just cycling inflation from a year ago. We are beginning to now cycle the higher inflation a year ago. Gary, with that, I'll let you get into a little bit more asset specific. Relative to the competitive environment, we continue to see it pretty similar to how it's been throughout the year. all retailers are doing everything they can to minimize the impact on inflation to customers the best you can do. And we obviously would use our personalized and promotions that are directly focused on individual households because of things we know they love to try to help people stretch their budget. We're also, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, seeing customers continuing to move to our brands. And in the past, what we find is when customers move to Our Brands, that's very, very sticky because the high quality of the product and the satisfaction there. So what we find is even when things are getting normalized, Our Brands come out of that at a higher penetration level than going in, which is long term good for our business as well. With that, Gary, I'll let you get into. Yes. In terms of the categories, the one you identified definitely would be the weaker category in terms of general merchandise. And that would be true at the Fred Meyer division, it would also be true across the rest of the organization as well. We continue to do well in those categories relative to the market. Our teams have done a great job of making sure they've been managing inventories relative to where the expectations themselves.\n The other categories that would be weaker than the total would be categories where we continue to have supply chain disruptions. Gary and I both mentioned, overall supply chain is getting better, but we still have categories like cat food, dog food, baby formula some of those types of cold remedies, some of those areas continue to have some supply chain issues as well. With the identicals, Gary, go on. Yes. I think when you look at Gary's points overall, it's one of the things that's so important about our overall business model because we do have a lot of moving parts, and we've invested a ton of work and effort our whole team has over the last several years to reinvent the business model and make sure the business model can be successful in every economic environment. And to me, Gary's point that he was sharing really highlight that as we look forward. Yes. If you look at market share, the trends continue to improve, and we feel good about where we are, but we're not satisfied with where we are. We believe the work that we're doing on Fresh is a key part of driving that.\n And obviously, just the continued personalization and making sure that we have a customer experience for its household to household type relationship. And then Our Brands always shines when an economic environment gets a little tougher. So it's really those things working together.\n And then our store teams continuing to do a good job of improving on friendliness. And I make that comment based on what customers tell us how we're doing, not just my opinion of how we're doing. Yes. It's a great question, Scott. And when we talk to our customers, they're telling us they're changing. But so far, they're changing on purchases other than food. So it's -- they are still prioritizing food. It gets a little bit back to one of the comments I made. It's still 3x or 4x cheaper to eat at home versus going out to a restaurant and so many more people have learned how to cook.\n So if you look at the behavior changes other than the movement to our brands and being much more aggressive on downloading digital coupons and engaging with some of our promotional offers. That's really the only behavior we've seen in our business outside of the comment I made earlier on our general business, but that's a much smaller part of our business than many of our competitors. No. It's all -- as you know, it's any place you look across the country, you'll see it in different stages. And -- but overall, what we see is pretty similar to what -- how it's been. I will start and then Gary, please add any color you want. But if you look long term, we always build our business model around 1% to 2% inflation. And if you -- as you know, any given year will be different than that. But longer term, we've always felt that, that's kind of where fundamental inflation will be. Obviously, over the last couple of years, it's been completely different than that.\n As I shared in my prepared remarks, our oil household growth was very strong this quarter, and it's been moving in the right direction. When customers first become a loyal household, what we find is, over time, we get a higher share of that household growth. And we really are seeing that what we define as our seamless experience where a customer can engage with us where we deliver, where they pick up in store and shop in store, it's that combination together that earns us the right.\n So as our loyal household grows, we get a higher share and that should be a tailwind to our identical sales growth over time. And that was the reason that we talked about it, and it's something, internally, we spend a lot of energy on it. And I know, Gary, is there any other color that you think would be helpful for people to understand. John, as you know, we manage our business on dollars. And for us, growing dollars is what creates a sustainable business model long term. And we always view that the better offer that we can be able to afford to give to our customers the more sustainable that is, and the only way we can do that is by managing our costs and continuing to find and identify areas of waste so that we can reduce that and fund that.\n Fundamentally, as you look at Kroger, we still would have that same strategy and we'd still expect that over time because what we find is that really connects well with the customers. We -- that allows us the capacity to continue to invest in our associates and support our communities. And when we do those 3 things right, the shareholders benefit.\n So I know broad picture, that's what we would do, the way we look at things. And obviously, with everything we do, we try to make sure we're doing it in a way that's sustainable long periods of time. Yes, it's a great question, Ken. And it's something that we're going to obviously manage in a very transparent way. And we wanted to go ahead and include it in this quarter, just the context of what is new, and that's what we've shared.\n If there was something material, we would share it between quarters. But in all likelihood in the foreseeable future updates would be on a quarterly basis. But if it was something material -- what we try to do on disclosure is if our roles were reversed, what is it that we think it would be helpful for someone to know, and that's what we always try to do. So -- and obviously, feel free to give us feedback when that doesn't feel right to you because we appreciate the feedback. Yes. It really gets back to overall. I think it's incredibly important to understand that we connect with the customer in multiple ways, and Fresh is a critical component of that. We fundamentally assume over time, the market is going to get more competitive. We've done that for 25 years. We'll continue to do that. And that's the reason why we put so much investment energy on personalizing experiences, supporting our associates in ways -- any way we can, pay, continue in education, even additional support on mental health and especially in today's environment.\n And what we have found in every environment by supporting and connecting with the customer from a full fresh and friendly experience and then having good prices and very aggressive promotion and then personalizing the experience, we're able to support the customer.\n One of the things that also supports gross margin as we continue to expect larger growth in our Fresh departments, which have higher margins in center store. And then when you look at our alternative profit businesses and some of those businesses have margins better than what the center store would be. So for us, it's -- you really have to look at all of those things together and look at those things over time, and we feel really good about the business model that we continue to develop and grow at our company. Well, I'll make a couple of comments, and Gary, you can think about some of the specifics. If you look at in our fresh departments, clearly, inflation is slowing down in many categories. Chicken would be an example. You're starting to see that in some of the other categories as well. And I always make the comment high inflation solves high inflation because farmers produce more when their margins improve.\n If you look at on CPG companies themselves, right now, it's kind of mixed. Some CPG companies are willing -- much willing to have higher prices and give up growth. And what we find is when CPGs do that, our brand is so strong, we really gained share. And that helps the customers budget and it also improves the stickiness and the loyalty of that customer as well. So it's -- what do they always say, all short statements and economics are wrong. And I really think you have to look at all the moving parts. I don't know, Gary, anything else you want to add to Michael's inflation? Gary, I'll let you talk about the -- a little color on the IDs and then on the foodservice after you finish Health. I share some things there. Yes. On foodservice, volume would actually be above where we would have been in 2019. For us, when we look at foodservice or food -- we are always -- I never know quite what to call it other than it's a great meal, easy to cook, easy to heat up, easy to assemble. It was the reason why strategically we merged with Home Chef because we thought Home Chef on its own had great trends and could continue to grow.\n We also felt like their capabilities we could leverage back into Kroger to further improve our mill pit and a great restaurant quality meals would be an example. If you look at sushi, we're the largest sushi restaurant in the United States as an example. Obviously, we partner with a lot of third parties and local entrepreneurs on that, sandwiches and all those things.\n So we see food service as an important component of our growth, not so much relative to 2023. But as you start looking out at, say, 2025 and beyond, and being -- having an amazing quality meal that's easy and leveraging our delivery network or pickup network is an important part of the growth as you look longer term. Yes. If you look at the overall trends in traffic, it continues to be improving. Obviously, the overall basket itself is heavily driven by inflation. But as I mentioned earlier, our trends on market share are moving in the right direction and continue to go in the right direction. In terms of the last part, I don't know, Gary, on inflation? Yes. Gary, I think that's a great point, and thanks for the questions. And for everyone, thank you for joining us today. As always, I always like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in because so many of our associates take the time to do that, which we appreciate. This is the time of year we truly shine.\n Our special holiday film made clear. We create the opportunity for our customers to transform today's holiday moments into tomorrow's memories. We've had the pleasure to hear from countless associates former associates and customers about just how touching this film has been. I know I can't watch it without getting a tear in my eye. And just reminding all of us how special it is to share favorite meals with those we love most.\n Thank you to our teams who put this together. Thank you for our teams who make the memories happen. It's a wonderful way to kick off the holiday season. As we all prepare together with our loved ones, I am so incredibly proud of our associates across the Kroger family of companies. We have accomplished so much this year. Thank you for the many ways you serve our communities and uplift our customers and each other. This concludes our call for today. We wish everyone a happy holiday season. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and encourage you to stay safe. Thank you."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's relentless focus on delivering value for our customers was the foundation of our strong results in quarter 3. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our consistent execution of our go-to-market strategy is resonating the shoppers and driving increased customer loyalty. We were especially pleased with the balance achieved in our results this quarter as we continue to invest in our customers and associates, while also effectively managing costs to achieve solid earnings growth.\n These results provide yet another proof point of the strength of our value creation model and our ability to operate successfully in different environments.\n I'll now provide additional color on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.88 for the quarter, an increase of 13% compared to the same quarter last year. This growth was driven by top line revenue and our disciplined approach to balancing investments with effective cost management.\n Identical sales without fuel grew 6.9%. Our Brands continue to resonate deeply with customers as sales grew 10.4%. The outstanding quality and value offered by these exclusive Kroger products is an important differentiator in our go-to-market strategy, and this is especially true during periods of high inflation. As we shared at our Investor Day in March, Our Brands products are margin accretive and represent a key pillar in our strategy to grow profitability while also delivering greater value for customers.\n Digital sales grew 10% during the quarter with delivery solutions leading the way, up 34% year-over-year. Delivery solutions includes the Kroger delivery network powered by Ocado delivery from our stores via Kroger and third-party platforms and our convenience offering, Kroger Delivery Now. Our industry-leading Net Promoter Scores in Kroger Delivery are driving new customer engagement and best-in-class retention rates.\n Gross margin was 21.4% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 5 basis points compared to the same period last year. This result reflected our team's ability to effectively manage higher product cost inflation and shrink through strong sourcing practices while also helping customers manage their budgets and keeping prices competitive.\n During the quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $152 million compared to $93 million in the prior year. This was primarily driven by higher product cost inflation in grocery. We still expect to see some moderation in inflation during our fourth quarter as we cycle higher inflation from a year ago.\n Kroger's operating general and administrative rates decreased 3 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items compared to the same period last year. The decrease in OG&A rate was driven by sales leverage and execution of cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by investments in our associates. We continue to identify opportunities to remove cost from our business without affecting the customer experience and are on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings.\n Kroger Health had another successful quarter, delivering higher-than-expected sales and profitability despite cycling the impact of higher COVID vaccine revenue from a year ago. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in health care, and our Kroger Health team remains committed to ensuring our customers obtain medically necessary prescriptions.\n Recently, we announced that we are terminating our Express Scripts agreement for commercial customers as of December 31. The Express Scripts contract would have required Kroger to fill our customers' prescriptions below our cost of operation, something we could not accept as we aim to keep our prices low for customers during this inflationary period. We expect this contract termination will reduce sales by about $100 million in Kroger's fiscal fourth quarter, impacting identical sales without fuel for the quarter by approximately 35 basis points. This decision is not expected to have an impact on operating profit or EPS.\n Included in our results for the quarter is an $85 million pretax charge related to the settlement of all opioid litigation claims with the State of New Mexico. This amount was excluded from our adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS results to reflect the unique and nonrecurring nature of the charge. This settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability by Kroger, and we will continue to vigorously defend against other claims and lawsuits related to opioids.\n This settlement is based on a unique set of circumstances and facts related to New Mexico, and Kroger does not believe that the settlement amount or any other terms of our agreement with New Mexico can or should be extrapolated to any other opioid-related cases pending against Kroger. It is our view that this settlement is not a reliable proxy for the outcome of any other cases or the overall level of Kroger's exposure.\n Currently, Kroger has 2 active matters pending in West Virginia and Texas scheduled for trial in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Kroger continues to believe that the claims are without merit, and that it has strong defenses to these claims. Kroger is also differently situated from many of the other defendants in these cases. Our pharmacy operations have a much smaller footprint, both in terms of the size of the business, and market share with respect to opioids, and we are proud of the outstanding work performed by our associates in delivering critical care and services to our pharmacy customers.\n Turning now to alternative profit businesses, which are a fast-growing and key part of our value creation model. The traffic and data generated by our supermarket business continues to create a flywheel effect for alternative profits and growth this quarter was again led by retail media. CPG brands are finding significant value in our unique ability to build custom audiences that draw on our data to deliver precisely measured return on investment.\n Last month, KPM added a new channel to its suite of retail media solutions, welcoming Snapchat into the portfolio. Advertisers are now able to use Kroger's proprietary capabilities to optimize Snapchat's immersive ad formats. We are constantly innovating to expand our reach, and KPM recently increased its programmatic advertising marketplace capabilities to include video and one of the fastest-growing digital media sectors, connected TV. These new frontiers will provide exciting future growth opportunities for KPN.\n Fuel is an important part of our overall value proposition, and our fuel rewards program remains a key differentiator to help customers stretch their dollars during a period of high inflation. Fuel rewards engagement remained high during the third quarter and led to gallon sales, which outpaced the market. The average retail fuel price was $3.84 this quarter, versus $3.24 in the same quarter last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.50 compared to $0.42 in the same quarter in 2021.\n The results we reported today would not have been possible without our incredible associates who continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and delivering a full, fresh and friendly experience for our customers. We have a long track record of investing in our associates and are committed to continuing these investments to ensure Kroger remains an employer of choice. Building on $1.2 billion of incremental investments since 2018 we have raised our average hourly rates by over 5% so far in 2022.\n During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Columbus, Las Vegas, Chicago, Fort Wayne and pharmacists in Southern California, covering more than 28,000 associates. During the fourth quarter, we have also ratified new labor agreements for associates in Toledo and Nashville, as well as the Teamsters master agreement.\n Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. During the quarter, cash flow was affected by increased inventory balances. This was predominantly due to higher product cost inflation, particularly in grocery, in stocks improving to pre-pandemic levels and forward buying of inventory in pharmacy. We are comfortable that our current level and mix of inventory is appropriate to support our future sales expectations and would expect to see an improvement in working capital during the fourth quarter.\n Regarding capital expenditures, we are committed to investing in the business to support our go-to-market strategy and continue to see many opportunities to drive future growth. As shared last quarter, various initiatives have been delayed due to supply constraints, and we now expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in 2022.\n The net effect of higher inventory and lower capital expenditures for the year is that we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2022. \n In closing, I'd like to share additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. The Kroger team's consistent execution of our go-to-market strategy continues to build momentum in our business and gives us the confidence to again raise our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 5.1% to 5.3%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $4.05 to $4.15, representing growth of 10% to 13% over 2021.\n This guidance assumes a LIFO charge of approximately $500 million for the full year, which represents a $300 million headwind over the 2021 LIFO charge. Our third quarter and year-to-date results highlight the strength of Kroger's value creation model, which has proven to be resilient in different operating environments. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns, and we look forward to sharing detailed 2023 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call in March.\n And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. Thanks, Rodney. And maybe just to confirm, so the trend in the early part of the fourth quarter has continued consistent with how we're performing in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, is continued consistent with outperformance in the third quarter. Michael, as to one part of your question there. \n I think the other piece is, Michael, yes, I think you captured them well is, as Rodney mentioned, we do believe this recycle higher inflation in the final quarter of 2021. We expect that to have some impact on the overall year-over-year growth in food at home during the fourth quarter. And obviously, we'll all see how that plays out.\n And then secondly, we have factored in the impact of the ESI, the Express Scripts contract termination as well for January. So overall, I think if you kind of take our full year guidance, we'd be guiding between 4% and 5% IDs for the final quarter of the year. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Just a couple of bits of extra color, Michael, on the fourth quarter for you. As you probably gathered from the guidance, it would be a lowest quarter for year-over-year growth in what we shared for EPS. I think a few things to bear in mind there. First of all, we'll be cycling the strongest quarter from last year. Last year's EPS growth in Q4 '21 was the highest growth that we had during the year. So we're cycling higher growth from prior year. We'd assume fuel margins will be flat during the fourth quarter. So no real headwind or tailwind there, where, as you know, fuel has been a tailwind for us in the last couple of quarters.\n And of course, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, year-over-year, LIFO will be around $100 million headwind in the fourth quarter of EPS because you may recall again that LIFO was only $20 million last fourth quarter. when we finalize the calculations. So that would be factors to bear in mind when you think about our EPS guidance. The only other thing I might mention is that you've heard me talk about on this call in previous quarters that when you look at our rolling 4 quarter sort of gross margin investment, somewhere between 10 and 20 basis points and OG&A leverage of 10, 20 basis points similarly to keep the business in balance. I would say that because we're cycling Q4 last year gross margin was relatively flat, and OG&A was relatively flat. So I would say you should probably expect our gross margin investment will be a little bit north of the 10 to 20 basis points in Q4, but our OG&A leverage should also be north of that 10 to 20 basis points as well. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Chuck. Yes, the biggest part of that, in fact, pretty much all of it, Chuck, would be -- you may recall at the start of the year, we shared that we've made the decision to stop dispensing certain drugs in our specialty pharmacy business because it didn't really tie to overall customer loyalty in our broader business, and it isn't profitable business for us. So we made that decision at the start of the year, and we adjust that out of our ID. So it's a like-for-like comparison, but it does create a disconnect between total sales and identical sales.\n One of those examples is actually helping gross margin as well as we're making those decisions to make sure we're optimizing the balance of the business. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. I think as you heard as mentioned on the call, we probably won't get into a lot of detail around 2023 guidance because we'd rather put it into context of the full picture for next year. As you might imagine, there'll be a lot of moving parts as we sort of bridge to share that color with you when we get to March next year.\n I think overall, though, certainly, some of the elements that you talked about are going to be key factors when you think about what will be at play as you think about 2023, if I kind of talk more in general themes. I think overall, I would say we feel good to answer your question about gross margin that we are very focused on -- and I think are proven for our model, but there are levers that we can pull to manage costs and sourcing effectively to improve mix over time with some of the momentum in our brands and the opportunities continue to accelerate fresh performance and innovation.\n So there are a number of areas when we look at the balancing gross margin that we believe we would expect there to be longer-term stability and our ability to manage that. I think when you look specifically at the moving parts for next year, I think there's going to be a lot of factors that will come into play as you think about next year.\n You're right in terms of if inflation normalizes and your numbers certainly correct around the $500 million impact this year, which would be a $300 million year-over-year headwind because last year's LIFO was also inflated as inflation started to rise in quarter 4 last year. If you remember, our LIFO charge is calculated at a very specific week of the year, even though we try and estimate it throughout the year.\n So we would believe that as we'll get into guidance next year, obviously, when we share our earnings, and we're still sort of forming views around what we think will happen with inflation, but we're probably looking at most of the external views that you are and most of the analysts' reports that we can look at in the USDA, et cetera, would be in that sort of more of that 2.5% to 3-or-so percent inflation for next year. We'll obviously provide more color on what we believe, but that's sort of where most of the data that we see tend to be pointing towards. Yes. I think again, I'll maybe just broaden it because again, I think it's a little bit dangerous to pick on one element of the model for next year. I do think that fuel margins have had obviously a very good run. And generally, I think margins are improving over time, but there is -- there has been in the last 2 years, some major volatility in shocks in the market. I think it's hard to see those being cycled. So you look at margins earlier in this year, and I think that's likely to be a headwind next year in looking at the fuel profitability.\n But again, I think you mentioned LIFO, another example for us would be -- as you look at our incentive plan, obviously, we're having a very strong year versus our expectations, having raised our guidance every quarter. So you get to more of a normalized incentive plan next year, assuming the budgets kind of your expected payout.\n We continue to take costs out of our business and find new ways to improve leverage in the model. It has been 5 years, as you know, journey for us. We believe supply chain and alternative profits are potential tailwinds next year as we continue to improve efficiency in supply chain and all profit continues to grow.\n So I think there's a lot of moving parts. And again, rather than sort of trying to bridge you to how all those play out. I think that's going to be a balance of puts and takes. And obviously, we're looking forward to sharing a lot more color when we get to March next year. I think you covered it well, Rodney. I guess the only couple of extra points, John, I would maybe add, I do think, as you know, our core strategy is to grow existing loyal customers and what was really pleasing in the quarter as we saw 2.5% growth in loyal customers. So we're seeing customers move through the loyalty curve, and that's always been carry the strategy to really deeply reward customers and grow that relationship.\n I think what we're also seeing though is that as Rodney mentioned, we're building that Seamless capability with digital, we are starting to now attract a larger number of households too and the investments we're making in digital are creating that capacity to grow households as well.\n I think the one thing on the loyal house, as I would say, too, is what we saw during the quarter have seen the last couple of quarters is that maybe that more affluent customer that has shopped maybe a larger number of retailers before that's consolidated more of their trips and total basket with Kroger as they may not need to adjust their budget because of inflation, but they feel it's the sensible and responsible thing to do, and they see Kroger as a great place to get the right quality at a great value as well, and we're seeing that consolidation happen. Yes. Thanks, Ken. For us, I don't think it's really something that we're concerned about. We obviously did have very ambitious plans for CapEx this year, playing some catch-up from last year. And we still believe the projects that we have on the horizon are going to be generating significant value for the company in the future and support our growth plans.\n But when we looked at the expectations for the rest of the year, there are a number of large projects, whether it's in supply chain or some of the stores, just where it's just taking longer to get them completed or there are some costs where it just makes sense to pause for a period of time and reintroduce when we believe that those costs will be more rational.\n So from our perspective, we don't look at it as having a major impact on our growth model. As you know, we kind of historically were at sort of that $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion of CapEx spend a year. We've moved it up to $3.5 billion, being our sort of target range. And I would still say that's probably directionally where we'd want to be long term, to be pushing to the top end of our TSR model.\n So we do believe it's important to be investing in the business, and we can still see plenty of opportunities to support that growth, but we just thought it was based on how long it's taking with certain things to get projects completed with supply availability that we think it's going to be a -- some of those projects will now blend into 2023, but we don't have a concern today about it impacting our growth algorithm. Yes, I think you covered it well, Rodney. I think Michael, as Rodney mentioned, we're seeing that Fresh is certainly starting to see some change in trajectory on inflation. So I think it is the grocery category that's the most stubborn if you like, in terms of where it's holding in inflation at the moment. And as Rodney said, I think from -- as we look forward from our perspective, if that were to continue without being sort of supported by true cost increases, then that creates an opportunity for us with our brands to improve margin and grow share over time. So I think that's the way we think about it in general. Okay. Great. Kelly, I think overall, we mentioned it in their prepared remarks somewhat as well. We've seen inflation starting to level. It's still obviously at very heightened levels. But if you look at the trend quarter-over-quarter, it really narrowed down to less than 1% increase in inflation in our Q3 versus our Q2.\n So what we were pleased about was in that context, the continued momentum in our overall ID sales when we look at our Q3 performance versus our Q2, and I think a lot of that ties to some of the prepared remarks that Rodney also shared around household growth that we're seeing and really some of the defying more share of wallet from loyal customers and seeing lower customer growth. So that's the piece that I think we've been the most pleased around.\n And we continue to perform really well with winning that first large basket with customers. We continue to see strong momentum there. And even as customers have continued to adjust their behavior as they kind of wrestle with inflation and decide how to balance budgets, we've been really pleased with how our overall pinning that first basket has continued to maintain strong momentum. Yes. Rupesh, thanks for the question. Maybe just a little bit more color on Q3 and Q4 as well because I think there's a little bit more to the story there as well that's worth understanding. I would say that certainly, you're right, the -- we saw a lot of benefit from sales leverage and productivity improvements during the quarter.\n The team did a great job in really managing costs, considering the inflation that we're facing in some of those cost areas. We would have also had higher incentive plan costs year-over-year in quarter higher technology costs. We're investing in a number of areas that we're seeing growth in year-over-year. And some of that is maybe flipping from capital to operating expense because as you move more to cloud-based activity.\n It just -- it does change the mix there as well. And we also invested, as we did in Q2 in some consultants and some advisory work to help build future momentum in the growth. So I would say the underlying improvement in productivity was stronger than the quarter would have suggested, and we feel good about the ability to leverage OG&A and fund the average hourly rate increases that we're seeing.\n In fact, as I mentioned earlier, the Q4 number as we're cycling a fairly flat OG&A rate in Q4, we would expect to be north of 20 basis points of leverage in the fourth quarter this year as we head into next year. I think probably similar to what we shared earlier, I think overall, as we're looking at the way the customer is changing behavior, as Rodney mentioned, trips improving, generally fairly consistent, I would say, over the year, but we are seeing higher trips from those loyal shoppers that have traditionally shopped in many different retailers for different categories and now seeing that trip consolidate to Kroger. I think is an important trend that we've seen throughout the year and continue to accelerate in the third quarter."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference call over to Rob Quast, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's second quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.  \n Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. [Operator Instructions] \n I will now turn the call over to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. \n The Kroger team delivered another strong performance during the quarter, fueled by our strategy Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. These consistent results underscore the resiliency and flexibility of our business model, along with our associates' passion to deliver a fresh, convenient customer experience with 0 compromise on quality, selection and affordability.  \n Customers continue to adjust their shopping habits in response to ongoing inflation. We are doing everything we can to help our customers stretch their dollars with high-quality fresh products at everyday low prices and industry-leading fuel rewards program and personalized savings on the items that matter most to them. Our customers are looking for ways to save and we are there for them.  \n During the quarter, digital coupon engagement hit an all-time high with 750 million digital offers downloaded, totaling almost $1 billion in savings. Our fuel rewards program continues to resonate with customers as more than 600,000 incremental households engaged with our fuel rewards program this quarter compared to last year. And our fuel reward redemption rates were also up significantly.  \n We continue to see more customers cooking from scratch and eating out less often. Our broad assortment of products is meeting the need for customers to buy what they want on their terms. For example, some customers are continuing to buy more of their favorite fresh products like apples, tomatoes and grapes. While other customers are choosing products like frozen fruit and vegetables, allowing products to last longer in their homes. Overall, customers are looking to save money and make healthier choices by cooking more meals at home rather than eating out. Kroger's strong value proposition drove positive household growth and meaningful [indiscernible] household growth both online and in-store.  \n Digital sales also returned to positive growth, driven by our one-of-a-kind boost membership program and expansion of our Kroger delivery network. It's clear our go-to-market strategy is connecting with customers, and we continue to build long-term customer loyalty through Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and our Seamless ecosystem.  \n Leading with Fresh, we are dedicated to serving our customers the freshest products so when they think food, they think Kroger. To achieve this goal, we are utilizing technology and deploying fresh innovation to deliver products faster, which stay fresher longer for our customers to enjoy. And it's working. In our 864 fresh certified stores, customers are purchasing more fresh products and overall store sales are growing faster than the rest of the business. Supply chain remains an important part of our fresh strategy as well. In order to maximize freshness, we are utilizing our data science and collaborating with our partners to minimize [ dwell ] time in our distribution network and maintain the integrity of the cold chain. We are also improving productivity in our supply chain. \n During the quarter, we reduced fuel cost headwinds through technology and process efficiencies, such as controlling more product movement across the value chain and maximizing our trucking capacity. While some categories remain challenging, supplier in-stocks are improving, and we are cautiously optimistic this will continue in the back half of the year.  \n Turning to Our Brands. We saw incredible engagement in Our Brands during the quarter with identical sales growth of 10.2% compared to last year. This increase was led by our Kroger and Home Chef brands. Convenience remains a priority and Home Chef is meeting that need by providing high-quality family meals as a budget-friendly alternative to eating out at restaurants.  \n For other customers who are enjoying cooking from scratch, Our Brands are delivering innovative products at a great value. So Our Brands' product strategy is rooted in quality, providing customers with memorable meal experiences they crave. And these products continue to earn world-class recognition. Most recently, Murray's Cheese varieties won five awards at the highly regarded 2022 American Cheese Society Competition. We were also recognized by Store Brands Magazine with 12 Editors' Picks awards for best new products, the most of any retailer. This recognition focused specifically on food that met customer needs for healthier products.  \n As we continue to look for ways to help our customers stretch their budgets, this quarter, we launched a new portfolio strategy for our opening price point brands. We consolidated 17 legacy brands into 2. Heritage Farm for our fresh and dairy product lines; and our newest brand, Smart Way for our nonperishable items. These brands are competitively priced and meet the needs of customers on a [indiscernible] budget. We launched with 150 SKUs and expect to roll out additional products by the end of the year.  \n Now moving to digital. We achieved positive sales growth, as I mentioned before, led by our strong delivery results. Early in the second quarter, we introduced our Boost membership nationwide, and it's already showing promising results including an increase in overall household spend among members. We remain focused on adding new members and are encouraged that enrollment is in line with our internal expectations and projections.  \n During the quarter, we opened a new Customer Fulfillment Center powered by Ocado's automated Smart Platform in Romulus, Michigan. Additionally, we are excited to expand the Kroger delivery network to more customers in four new geographies during the quarter through spoke facilities in Austin, Birmingham, Oklahoma City and San Antonio. This brings our total CFC and spoke count to 18.  \n We also continue to invest in our pickup business, where demand remains strong. During the quarter, we increased capacity and shortened wait times to improve our customer experience. We also invested in technology and implemented process efficiencies, which helped lower our cost to serve.  \n Our customers are telling us they love our Seamless experience. We continue to see customers effortlessly shift between store, pickup and delivery, which is building loyalty. We continue to improve the experience. And we'll always encourage our customers to shop with us how they want to and with 0 compromises.  \n Our associate dedication and passion continue to fuel Kroger's consistently strong results, and we are proud to invest in our teams and improve the associate experience. We saw more people apply to work at Kroger this quarter as we continue to attract talented associates.  \n Our current associates, we are making progress on retention. We've rolled out improved onboarding guidelines and implemented career planning tools. In addition, as part of our commitment to associate wellness, we recently introduced a new financial coaching service tool for hourly associates. This unique benefit offers free financial planning assistance to our associates. We are launching the tool in three pilot divisions and look forward to expanding the service across the company by January of 2023.  \n It is always exciting to see our associates' commitment to creating an outstanding work environment recognized. For the third consecutive year, Kroger was named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, earning a perfect score on the 2022 Disability Equity Index. Additionally, the Brandon Hall Group, a leading human capital management firm, honored Kroger for our training programs and the ways in which our teams promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Each team member is involved in creating our culture where associates come for a job and discover a career.  \n Our Purpose: to Feed the Human Spirit inspires our team every day. One important way we bring our purpose to life is through Kroger's comprehensive ESG strategy. Our aim is to achieve lasting positive change for people and our planet. Our newly published 2022 ESG report called Nurturing Shared Values, outlines the entire Kroger family strong progress against dozens of environmental sustainability, social impact and governance goals and commitments.  \n We continued working to operationalize and integrate ESG within our business. Nowhere is this more evident than through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. This month marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste. And while we still have much -- so much more work to do to achieve our moonshot goal of achieving a world free from hunger and food waste, we also have so much to celebrate. Over the past 5 years, our team donated 2.3 billion meals to our neighbors in need, which included $1 billion in giving to fight food and security, 500 million pounds of surplus food donated to our food bank partners and nearly $45 million in grants to support food recovery and system change from our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation. And I'm very proud to share for the first time ever, our store teams achieved 100% execution of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste food rescue, which is the strongest proof point yet of the value of operationalizing ESG. It took all of our teams working cross-functionally to achieve this important milestone. A huge congratulations and thank you to all involved.  \n In summary, Kroger delivered another strong second quarter. We continue to delight our customers, strengthen our business model and execute on our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. We remain focused on delivering for our associates, customers and communities. And when we do that well, deliver value for our shareholders.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our second quarter financials. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. \n The Kroger team is laser-focused on executing our go-to-market strategy, which we outlined at our Investor Day in March. Our balanced business model has proven to be resilient in a variety of operating and economic environments, and our second quarter performance provided another proof point of this as we delivered significant year-over-year growth.\n I'll now provide additional color on our second quarter results. We achieved strong identical sales growth without fuel of 5.8% and saw momentum build throughout the quarter. Our Brands led the way with identical sales growing 10.2%. We believe the unmatched combination of innovation, quality and value provided by Our Brands is a clear competitive advantage as inflation remains front of mind for many of our customers.  \n Adjusted EPS was $0.90 for the quarter, an increase of 13% compared to the same quarter last year and ahead of our internal expectations. These results were driven by increased sales of our fuel, disciplined margin management and strong fuel profitability.  \n Our seamless digital ecosystem is critical to building deeper customer loyalty and accelerating market share growth. During the quarter, digital sales grew 8%, led by strength in delivery solutions, which grew by 34%. We continue to invest in digital growth initiatives, including the expansion of our Kroger Delivery network in new and existing geographies, investments in the customer value proposition via Kroger Boost membership and the expansion of customer trip missions, including meal solutions and Kroger Delivery Now. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our positive momentum in digital sales will continue in the second half of the year.  \n Kroger Health also contributed meaningfully to our second quarter results as we grew the profitability of our core pharmacy business. This allowed us to cycle the impact of higher COVID-19 vaccine revenue from a year ago, which is especially impressive given the number of [ vaccinations ] administered last year.  \n Gross margin was 20.9% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. This result reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost inflation through strong sourcing practices while helping customers manage their budgets and keeping prices competitive.  \n Our team is doing an outstanding job navigating the current inflationary environment. We are experiencing the benefits of a multiyear journey in enterprise sourcing that is delivering significant and sustainable savings for Kroger and our customers. Our personalized pricing strategy is enabling us to maximize the reach and effectiveness of our promotional investments to drive loyalty and deliver value for our customers in ways they value most. Together, this has enabled Kroger to improve our price position relative to our key competitors.  \n Due to continued heightened levels of product cost inflation, we recorded a LIFO charge for the quarter of $148 million compared to $47 million in the prior year. We expect inflation will remain at heightened levels in the second half of the year but moderate on a year-over-year basis as we start to cycle the higher inflation, which began in the third quarter last year.  \n Kroger's OG&A rate increased 36 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven by investments in associates, higher incentive plan costs and strategic investments in various margin expansion initiatives, partly offset by sales leverage and continued execution of cost savings.  \n We continue to identify opportunities to remove costs from our business without affecting the customer experience and they're on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings.  \n As I mentioned a moment ago, the increase in our OG&A rate during the quarter was unusual as it included an accrual catch-up for higher projected incentive costs covering the first half of the year, as well as strategic investments in a number of margin expansion initiatives that will drive future growth. We would expect to achieve year-over-year improvements in our OG&A rate in the second half of the year and for the full year.  \n Turning now to alternative profits. Kroger Precision Marketing continues to increase its relevance with our CPG partners. During the quarter, we saw an increase in brand reinvestment rates as CPGs experienced strong returns on their marketing spend with KPM. Kroger Personal Finance products and services are also connecting well with customers in the current environment, providing even more ways to save. This includes our KPF credit card featuring an introductory $0.55 off per gallon of fuel and our gift card program, which promotionally offers 4x fuel rewards.  \n Fuel remains an important part of our business model and delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our fuel rewards program is a key differentiator to help customers stretch their dollars, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers engage with our fuel rewards program at the highest rate since the start of the pandemic during the second quarter, and this helped to ensure our gallon sales outpace the market.  \n The average retail fuel price was $4.62 this quarter compared to $3.13 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.62 compared to $0.39 in the same quarter in 2021. The strength of our fuel results is a great example of the flexibility that exists within our business model as higher fuel profit fully offset the higher LIFO charge in the quarter and allowed us to reinvest strategically in a number of margin expansion initiatives.  \n Our associates continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and serving our customers, and we are investing in hourly wages to ensure Kroger remains an employee of choice. We're also committed to continuing to invest in our associates and sustainably growing hourly wages. These investments are fully contemplated in our long-term financial model.  \n During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Houston, Memphis, Lake Charles, Shreveport, Las Vegas Clarkson and Meat, Southern California [ Clarkson Meats ] and Indianapolis, covering more than 40,000 associates. In the second half, we plan to complete contract negotiations for Chicago, Columbus, Fort Wayne, Toledo, South Bend and Southern California pharmacists.  \n Turning now to our financial strategy and liquidity. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. As a result of our operating performance and working capital improvements over recent years, our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.63 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Underlying initiatives to improve working capital also helped offset higher inventory balances during the quarter, which were a function of higher product cost inflation and in-stocks returning to pre-pandemic levels.  \n We continue to prioritize capital investments that support our go-to-market strategy and see many opportunities to drive future growth. As we updated in our guidance today, we now expect our range for capital investments for 2022 to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion as various initiatives have been delayed due to supply constraints. \n Earlier this quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend by 24%, reflecting our confidence in our long-range plans and our ability to continue to generate strong free cash flow. The quarterly dividend has grown at a 14% compounded annual growth rate since being reinstated in 2006. And this marks the 16th consecutive year of dividend increases.  \n During the quarter, we also repurchased $309 million of shares and year-to-date, have repurchased $975 million of shares. Earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program.  \n I'd now like to share additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. The Kroger team's consistent execution in our go-to-market strategy is building momentum in our business, which combined with sustained food-at-home trends gives us the confidence to again raise our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 4% to 4.5%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $3.95 to $4.05, representing growth of 7% to 10% over 2021. This outlook includes a year-over-year headwind from LIFO of approximately $100 million in the second half of 2022.  \n In closing, we have the right go-to-market strategy and are operating from a position of strength. Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time.  \n And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. \n The Kroger team successfully navigated another quarter in a dynamic operating environment with strong results. As our customers continue to deal with high inflation, our value proposition is resonating with them. And this reflects the balance we've built into our model. We have demonstrated the ability to offer customers fresh, affordable food and the value they need to help them manage their budgets while we continue to invest in our associates, reinvest in our business and consistently generate strong results. Our performance gives us the confidence that we have the right plan in place to build on our momentum and continue delivering value for all stakeholders.  \n So with that, Alex, we'll turn it over for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim. \nJohn Heinbockel: I want to start a little quick with the improvement you saw in IDs, can you break that out into traffic and ticket? And then maybe within ticket, right, AUR versus items per basket? And is -- I know nonfood has been a big drag. Is that still a drag? Did that get better at all? \nW. McMullen: I'll start on that and let Gary add some more of the details. The biggest part of the drive in improving trends is continued improvement in our loyal household growth and total household of people coming to our stores. We continue to see average transaction size smaller as people come into the store more often and more frequent. We would continue with some headwinds from the nonfood products as well. \n Gary, any additional insights you want to provide? \nGary Millerchip: I think you covered most of it, Rodney. As Rodney mentioned, John, we're certainly seeing for our most low shoppers continuing to win that first basket, and we're definitely seeing, as we look at our trends, that's holding up very well compared to what we're seeing overall within the market. And for our most loyal customers, as Rodney mentioned, we're seeing that number grow overall and trips also growing with our customer that most loyal shoppers starting to increase the number of trips into the store as well. So I think they are the key points that I would call out. \nW. McMullen: Yes. The only other thing that might be helpful insight, John, is it's pretty consistent across the country as well. \nJohn Heinbockel: Real quick follow-up then, right? Your nonfuel gross is the best we've seen, or one of the best we've seen in a while despite the inflation. So maybe is that mix -- role of mix versus -- I'm curious if there's a lot of forward bought product that you're benefiting from? Or is that still hard to get? \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look, one of the things that our teams have done a nice job is on procurement. The other piece would be, as you mentioned, mix. The fresh departments continue to help on mix. And we continue to see a lot of customers continue to add value-added products as well. \n I don't know Gary, any additional comments? \nGary Millerchip: Yes, I think you picked up the biggest drivers with sourcing and the benefits. It's not so much forward buying but continuing to be really disciplined, John, with how we look at the designer product and how we're managing relationships with our supply partners as well. \n One of the areas I would say, specifically in that, that was a tailwind this quarter versus last quarter is the sourcing team and supply chains working really well together to offset the pressure on fuel costs and making sure that we're improving efficiency in the supply chain and operating at optimum levels to really offset that. And naturally, whereas in the last couple of quarters, supply chain would have been a headwind to gross margin, it was essentially flat this quarter. And that wasn't because fuel costs were not a headwind year-over-year. It was really how we applied our approach to the challenge across sourcing the supply chain to make our operation more efficient. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO. \nKelly Bania: Just wanted -- if you could help us understand how fuel is impacting that. I think your prior plan was for a $50 million headwind. I think you just talked about LIFO, which sounds like is going to be about $150 million higher for the year. Just trying to think about those puts and takes as it relates to kind of the core flow-through of the higher [ IEs ] and how that impacts the back half? \nW. McMullen: Gary, go ahead. \nGary Millerchip: Yes, absolutely. Kelly, thanks for the question. Yes, I think you've actually picked on many of the key points. We would be expecting many of the levers that we've been pulling in managing to grow sales and grow customer loyalty and manage the margin performance in the business will be consistent in the back half of the year. The key elements that we called out are what would optically make our EPS growth look less meaningful in the second half. \n First of all, as you mentioned, our total LIFO charge for the year is about a $250 million headwind for the whole year, which translates to about $100 million, so about $0.10 of EPS impact in the back half of the year. \n On fuel, we haven't changed our view. [ Fuel's ] been very difficult to predict, and we don't want to kind of rely on potential upside in fuel when it really isn't something that we -- while the team does a great job of managing the best in the conditions, we don't lead, obviously, on fuel pricing. Our reward program, which really what drives our strategy in fuel. So we're assuming, as we cycle $0.43 to $0.44 of CPG profit from the back half of last year, but if fuel rates more sort of return to normalized levels, then that would be a $50 million to $60 million headwind in the back half of the year. \n So there's about $0.16 of EPS headwinds that we have built in today for LIFO. Were it not for those two, then essentially our EPS would be sort of in the 6% to 8% growth range very much in line with our TSR. So we do still expect the underlying profitability of our supermarket business to improve in the back half of the year as we exclude LIFO and fuel. \nW. McMullen: Yes. Just a couple of additional things. And Gary mentioned one of these in his prepared remarks, but the organization still has incredibly strong cost control, and this will be the fifth year in a row that we've been able to get over $1 billion of cost out. Obviously, that's an important part of that. And we do expect alternative profit to continue to be a little strong, a little bit stronger in the second half of the year as the first half of the year as well. \nKelly Bania: Okay. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up with digital. So growth of 8%. I think that brings it about flat in the first half. Just wondering if you could help us understand how that compares to your expectation and how -- really, how Ocado is ramping within that? I see here this 34% growth in delivery sales. But just are you on pace with the ramp of Ocado? And just about your goal in terms of doubling digital sales, how do you feel about that today? \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look, the thing that I think is always important is Ocado is one part of our overall digital strategy. And the thing that we're wanting to make sure that we have is a seamless ecosystem where customers can easily go between delivery, pickup and shopping in stores. And what we find is, by far, the majority of the people that -- customers that stop engaging with us on pickup come back into store and we capture that in-store versus delivery. So when you look at the overall seamless system, we're really focused on how do we -- and that's one of the reasons we introduced Boost, is how do we have that total loyalty across all the engagements with the customer. \n If you look at -- the thing that I'm super proud of our teams on the sheds that as we open them in the spokes is our Net Promoter Score from those continue to be world-class and incredibly strong. And that business -- and the customer continues to engage more frequently with us there. And overall, I'm pleased with the results, but we still obviously have plenty of work to do. \n I don't know, Gary, anything else you want to add to the question? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Just a couple of things. Overall, I would say, Kelly, we're pleased with the progress that we saw in the quarter. As you heard me mention in my prepared comments, we're certainly starting to see some traction on some of the key initiatives that we've been investing in, whether it's the Customer Fulfillment Centers that are powered by Ocado in both new and existing markets, the launch of Boost and as Boost continues to ramp up and we see about 25% of customers that sign up for Boost are completely new to digital. So that's a really good driver of the digital business as well. \n And then we're still in the early infancy stages of some of those convenience trip missions that I mentioned, whether it's Kroger Delivery Now with our partnership with Instacart, where products can be delivered, smaller baskets, within 30 minutes, and also the meal solutions, things like sushi and [indiscernible]. So a lot of really exciting developments and activities that we're focused on, and we saw some good momentum in those areas coming through, which is why we also shared in my prepared comments that we'd expect the momentum to continue in the back half of the year. \n I think the only other comment I would make is that we are taking a step back certainly to figure out what is the overall market digital growth is likely to look like this year because Rodney mentioned during his prepared comments that we're building a seamless ecosystem for the customer and what we're seeing and customers are moving between the channels and making the decisions of where they shop. And ultimately, we want to make sure the customer will go to Kroger and they're choosing to shop through the store or pickup or delivery, whatever works for them. And we certainly have certain assumptions around how we thought the digital market will grow this year, and we've sort of taken a step back as we look at the back half of the year and really sort of assess how we think the market overall is growing. But our focus is really on making sure that seamless ecosystem is winning the customers' loyalty overall, whichever channel they choose to shop through. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Spencer Hanus from Wolfe Research. \nSpencer Hanus: I just wanted to talk about the price gaps for a minute. Could you talk about how comfortable you are with where you're trending today? And have you noticed any change in your ability to pass through price increases as some of your peers have been a bit more rational on that front? \nW. McMullen: Yes, if you look overall, we continue to be satisfied with inflation and the pass-through. As Gary and I both mentioned, we're doing everything we can to minimize those increases and do it in a way that helps the customer in any way we can. And when you look at the total value proposition, we feel very good. When you look at fuel rewards, as I mentioned, we had 600,000 incremental households engaging in fuel rewards and record redemption from customers as well. \n So overall, we're doing -- I feel very good about the ability to balance all the pieces and minimize the impact on the customer as much as we can. We feel very comfortable with our price gaps. And price gaps is with a multiple of different competitors is something that we track on an ongoing basis. And we feel good about the everyday price gap. And as you know, we get great feedback from customers on our promotional approach and customers really appreciate the promotional values that we offer as well to allow customers to stock up on items they use the most. \n And we are very focused on using our data to make sure our offers are personalized for each household individually and discounts that just apply to them. And that's probably part of what's driving the fact that we had 750 million coupons downloaded as well. \nSpencer Hanus: Got it. That's helpful. And then just to go back to Ocado for a minute. What are you seeing from the facilities that are located in the new geographies versus your existing markets? And as we think about the profitability of these sheds, any updated view on when we'll get to breakeven EBITDA there? \nW. McMullen: Yes, I'll answer the first part of that and let Gary answer the second part of your question, Spencer. We continue to ramp up and the ramp in new markets would be among some of the best [indiscernible] sheds across the Ocado network. And as I mentioned before, the NPS scores are outstanding, a world-class or whatever positive you want to assign to them. And as customers engage with us with our Boost membership or our membership programs, that's causing them to even be more loyal as well. \n In terms of the financial side, Gary, I'll let... \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. I wouldn't say, Spencer, if there's anything dramatically changed in our view that we shared previously around how we think about the CFCs powered by Ocado maturing over time. I think, as Rodney mentioned, we've certainly been pleased with what we're seeing with customer connection and sales trends. And when we think about the Net Promoter Scores and the value that we're offering, we're seeing that the gross margin profile, if you like, of that customer and also the growth that we have expected is very much in line with what we have originally envisaged. \n As you know, I think one of the key things for us with the big facilities is it is a 4 to 5-year journey as you're building to maturity and building to scale. And so there are some elements of that, that until you kind of understand what the customer density looks like at scale, we're still figuring out some of that operational efficiency in the model. So there's nothing really new I would call out, but we continue to work on building that full picture. And as you know, in the first two facilities, we're only 18 months really in that journey of a 4-year journey overall to get to capacity. But generally, I'd say still consistent with what we shared previously. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. \nMichael Lasser: There was about a 50-basis point acceleration in your 3-year geometric stack. Was that all driven by an acceleration in inflation from the first to the second quarter? And it looks like your guidance implies that you're expecting your IDs to go back to that kind of high 5% run rate in the second half of the year on the same 3-year geometric stack basis. So would that also imply that you're expecting the lower contribution from inflation in the back half of the year? \nW. McMullen: Part of it, Michael, is we're starting to cycle higher inflation a year ago. So it's really -- we do not expect inflation on inflation to be as high. So it's really driven by the cycling of where we were a year ago. And as you would recall, as we get later in the year, inflation ramped up very aggressively in the back half of last year. We expect the business to continue to stay strong and continue to make strong progress. We just don't expect the inflation to be quite as high as it was. \n The first part of your question, Gary, you may have been able to just -- yes, you're kind of working in and out. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Michael, I think we tend not to look at it specifically in the way that you're describing at that 3-year view. But I would say that overall, we think about our progress in the second quarter, we believe we were able to accelerate our growth relative to Q1 compared to the market. So we felt that from everything you could see, we were able to win customers and to change trajectory versus how the market was moving from Q1 to Q2. So we feel very positive about the momentum that we saw in the business in Q2. \n And as Rodney mentioned, we believe that momentum will continue in the back half of the year, but we are expecting while inflation will remain at heightened levels, we think it will start to taper out because with the cycling, call it, 4% higher inflation in the back half of last year compared to the first half of last year. So even if inflation does continue to grow, you're cycling about 4% higher inflation rate from the prior year. \n And we are starting to see a little bit of data that would say it's really hard to predict, and none of us had our perfect crystal ball. But if you look at the growth in cost inflation from Q1 to Q2, it would be less than the growth that we saw in Q4 last year to Q1 this year. And some of the forward-looking futures data on some of the key commodities are starting to show a little bit of signs that things may be leveling off somewhat. So obviously, there's been plenty of shocks in the last 12 months that can change that very quickly. But the data points that we can see right now, we think it's appropriate to forecast and provide guidance that it seems slightly tapering to the inflation rate in the back half of the year. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is Kroger's been pretty nimble in managing its FIFO gross margin, as was evidenced by this quarter. Was some of that due to the ability to pass along price increases a little faster than you're getting the price increases passed along to you from your vendor community? And it does seem like some consumable retailers are announcing that they're going to make sizable price investments in the back half of the year. So how does that influence your view of the ability to sustain this FIFO gross margin performance over the next couple of quarters? \nW. McMullen: Well, obviously, all -- everything that you asked would have been reflected in our guidance for the balance of the year. We would -- most CPGs, you know well in advance of cost increases. So you're balancing the actual getting the cost increase along with what you pass through to customers. Obviously, you are -- on a weekly basis, you're looking at what pricing, where you are on spreads, better or worse than your competitors. \n And the other thing that I think it's always important to remember for a customer that shops at Kroger, there's personalized rewards that are individualized for each household that the market would never see. And that's something that's incredibly valuable for our customers in addition to our fuel rewards and other pieces. So I think you really have to look at the total value proposition. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Maybe just to add, Rodney, I think, Michael, from the perspective of how we manage gross margin, I think of it much more of a -- we're not trying to manage to a number every quarter. Obviously, we're managing it more long term and there's lots of moving parts that we manage. The tailwinds would be the work we do in sourcing, the mix improvements through fresh growing and Our Brands growing and new innovation products. And of course, things like alternative profit streams adding to that model as well. So we're still investing in the customer. And from our perspective, we feel very good about our ability to manage the model through the evolving environment. \n And overall, again, if you look at our rolling 12 months of gross margin, it's probably in that sort of 10 to 20 basis points of investment. And I think that's what we shared at the beginning of the year where we expect it to be. So we are delivering, we believe, on the plan that we shared. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My question is on the consumer to diagnose some of the changes we're seeing. It looks like there was some trade down brewing across all of consumer. And you mentioned that your business picked up from June throughout the quarter. So can you talk about if you're seeing a level of either trading down or movement to private brands you heard, is the level, is it stabilizing? Did it [indiscernible] inside with gasoline prices leveling off and [indiscernible] getting stronger now? Or would this [indiscernible]? \nW. McMullen: If you look at customer behavior, they're telling us they're modifying behavior more so outside of the grocery store than with us. Now the movement to Our Brands, what we always find is customers do it initially to save a little bit of money, but they fall in love with the product. So part of the continued acceleration of growth in Our Brands is driven by the value, but part of it is just the quality of the product. And that's been something that's been a long-term trend, not just a current trend. \n The customers -- it's one of the reasons why we're so proud of our overall offering is customers can move between different types of product. But we still see customers engaging in things that are fresh, and are healthy, those aspects as well. So we're going to be there forever how the customer wants and needs us to be, and we're going to be very agile as well. \nSimeon Gutman: Abbreviated follow-up is inflation. It sounds like we're not quantifying what the absolute level is. You all know we're going to see a moderation in the second half. Let's just say you're running in line with CPI for food and home. Could that actually get cut in half in the back half of the year? Is it going to be more moderate? And then in terms of elasticity, does it actually behave that quickly where you're seeing units for volume actually respond and go back up, so we're in the same place anyway? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I mean I think from what we see, we wouldn't expect it to be that dramatic a change. As I mentioned, I think we would expect there to be some flattening out of inflation in the back half of the year, but there's nothing that we see right now that would cause us to believe there's going to be a dramatic change in the level of inflation in the back half of the year. \n And from our perspective, I think it probably ties back to Rodney's earlier comment, we feel that we're monitoring and using our data very closely to adapt as to how customers change behavior. And we believe through the combination of fuel rewards, through the Our Brands portfolio of products that we offer and through the pricing and promotional offers that we have, we've got a very strong sort of portfolio of plans to be able to adapt to the customer with us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan Chase. \nKenneth Goldman: I was curious, you mentioned Home Chef. Were there any other categories or broader departments where your brands were maybe surprisingly strong this quarter? I would assume the usual suspect milk and soy were healthy. But were there others where the -- I guess the share shift was bigger than you might typically see in this kind of environment? \nW. McMullen: Yes, it's a great question, Ken. And it's really broad-based. And the banner brand, I wouldn't say it's a surprise, but the banner brand continues to gain solid share. But even if you look at like private selection, which has a lot of unique and new products, the growth there continued to be strong as well. So it was very broad-based across really the whole store. \nKenneth Goldman: Got it. And then on the higher OG&A this quarter, you called out a few reasons for -- and thank you for that. One of them was a onetime accrual catch-up. Can you give us a sense -- I don't think I heard how big that catch-up was? And then on the margin expansion initiatives, I recognize it's an ongoing process. But just in light of where the OG&A came in, were there any new initiatives launched? Is there anything that we should think about that may be unique that we haven't necessarily heard about yet? Or just is more of the ongoing process that you have? \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Ken. I think what I would say is overall, if you think about there's probably three pieces that impacted OG&A materially during the quarter. The one you mentioned, which was the true-up for the first half of the year on our incentive calculation based on our improved performance, we calculate what the [indiscernible] would be for the year. And so we have to catch up for the first 2 quarters in the year. \n Secondly, as you mentioned, we invested in some strategic initiatives that we believe will accelerate growth as we look into '23 and beyond in particular, and I'll come back to that in a second. The third would be, we were cycling 1 or 2 items that were -- as of the timing were particularly strong in Q2 last year. So when you add those three things together and sort of remove them from the number, we would have achieved an improvement in the OG&A rate during the quarter, which is why we kind of guided you to when we take out those three factors, which wouldn't repeat in our view for the rest of the year, but we would expect overall for the rest of the year to see OG&A rate improvement. It's probably fairly flat in Q3, but likely to be meaningfully better than that in Q4 is how we would think about it. And I wouldn't want to get into maybe breaking down the digital because we typically don't do that. But I would just say that all three of those together will really what caused the increase in the rates. \n As regards to the new initiatives, I think it is more of what you've seen before. It's more just that as we look at how the customer is changing and our business model continues to evolve. We identified 2 or 3 areas where we think there are opportunity to accelerate. And an example would be in shrink and investing in some new capabilities to be able to continue to improve shrink performance as we look out for the forecast for our model on shrink and that, of course, helps gross margin as well. \n And then I mentioned earlier, but we're really pleased with the progress that we made in health and wellness during the quarter, and we made some strategic investments in the health and wellness space where we believe there's an opportunity for us to continue to drive profitable growth, not only in the second half of this year as we cycle the vaccines for last year but also beyond in 2022 and 2024. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. \nRobert Moskow: I wonder if you could give a little more color on the Smart brands initiative. Is it providing anything new to the consumer in terms of opening price points, like lower price points than before? Or you're really just consolidating several of your sub-brands to make it a little easier to shop? And then I just had a quick follow-up. \nW. McMullen: The majority is consolidating the sub-brands, just making it easier to shop. Those items are always great value for the money. The other thing that there would be incremental items introduced under the Smart Way brand in terms of just the absolute number of SKUs. So it's really a combination of introducing some new items and consolidating several sub-brands and making it easier for customers to shop. \nRobert Moskow: Okay. And then a follow-up on CapEx. You're not the first to lower CapEx guidance among consumer goods companies. And it all -- it usually seems to be because of project delays. But I imagine volume is less than what you had expected this year because the pricing is so high. So is there any correlation here between like a lower volume environment in an inflationary cycle and what your CapEx plans might be for the next couple of years? \nGary Millerchip: I wouldn't say, Robert, really changes our view of the opportunity ahead of us. As you know, we've laid out a clear plan at our Investor Day in March, and we still feel really confident in both the growth model that we outlined and where we believe the strategic investments will make sense across the supply chain, across our store portfolio and obviously continue to invest in digital. So I wouldn't read into it that we're any less excited or have less confidence in those plans. It's far more the former point that you made. But when we look at some of the short-term supply challenges, when we look at some of the costs in the market in the short term, it just made more sense in our view to balance that plan and to adjust the schedule. So it would be far more in that camp than the other. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [ Brandon Cheatham ] on for Paul. I was wondering if you could help us a little bit on the fuel margin cents per gallon were very strong in the quarter, but it sounds like you expect fuel to be a headwind in the second half. So can you help us, how much of the fuel margin was driven kind of by internal initiatives or external market forces that I guess you're not expecting to repeat in the second half? \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. Overall, our team did a fantastic job in managing fuel margins. And as I think you probably know, we -- our goal is to make sure we're very competitive on price, and then we give significant value back to our customers via our fuel rewards program that flows through our supermarket gross margin, not through that fuel P&L that we share -- the metrics that we shared on the call. So overall, last quarter would certainly have been some great work by our team in capturing value wherever they go through sourcing of fuel and how we promoted and drove engagement with customers. But a lot of it is also just to do with the volatility in the market and as prices were changing in the fuel market, which I think has been seen across the industry. \n So as we look forward, we believe we have a clear strategy around delivering great value for the customer, making sure we're sourcing the product really effectively, optimizing the reward program. Our view at some point is that fuel margins sort of normalize, and we don't think it's prudent for us to predict these extremely high unusual levels of profitability. So I wouldn't say we have perfect insight into what will happen to fuel margins in the back half of the year. We think it's prudent to bring them back to more of what we thought would be a normal rate at the beginning of the year. If it turns out that there is significantly greater margins on fuel then, of course, that would impact our outcome for the rest of the year, but we think it would be not prudent for us to be forecasting that. That's really how we think about the rest of the year. \nUnknown Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And a quick follow-up. I was just wondering if you could break out price inflation, how much that drove ID sales in the quarter? And how much of that was offset by units? I assume, declined slightly in the quarter. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think just a bit of color maybe to the last comment, we mentioned on this one would be that our sales growth was higher than the increase that we saw from Q1 to Q2, was higher than the increase we saw in cost inflation. So overall, we're pleased with the trajectory in our growth. And we believe compared to the market, we were able to improve our trajectory, Q2 versus Q1 compared to how the market overall performed. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, [ Brandon ], for the question. The other thing I think is important that I mentioned earlier is that we had household growth overall and loyal household growth as well, which is always important for the future. \nRob Quast: Alex, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So maybe just a follow-up to the prior question. Just any perspective just on market share? It sounds like your GAAP versus [ peers ] may have narrowed this quarter, but just any thoughts on the performance this quarter and then how you're looking at that for the balance of the year? \nW. McMullen: Yes. The gap has continued to narrow and it's narrowed during the quarter as well. And if you look at it for the balance of the year, our teams would expect to continue to make progress and really proud of where we are. And we think the overall value for the customer and the overall seamless experience and focus on fresh continues to accelerate, and the customer continues to reward us for that as well. \nRupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And one follow-up question, just on CapEx as well. So this year, CapEx is pretty significantly below your prior plan. Do you believe we could be in a period of just lower sustained CapEx spend just given some of the headwinds out there? \nGary Millerchip: I think, Rupesh, like I mentioned earlier, we feel very good about the plans we have to achieve our long-term -- or our overall TSR model around the growth that we've shared around growing earnings at 3% to 5% and our TSR at 8% to 11%. And we've got, I think, some very clear capital expenditure plans that we believe will allow us to drive that sustained growth. \n So I think we are being deliberate in the short term about making sure the -- if the pricing of certain supplies and products just would change their return materially then we're adjusting our timing there, and there are some challenges just around labor and raw materials and getting the plans executed in the time scale that we'd originally envisaged. But I don't think for us, we look at the announcements that we made this morning on our latest forecast of CapEx as being less excited about the prospects of investing in the business for growth. I think it's more of a function of just some of the short-term headwinds for us. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. \n And as you know, I always like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in as well. We are so proud of everything that everyone's achieved in this half of the year. Our outstanding associates continue to provide a world-class customer experience. And thank you directly on behalf of everyone for everything that you do for our community, our customers and each other every day. \n I'd also like to take a moment to recognize our Louisville and Delta divisions and our manufacturing and distribution teams who responded immediately to help in the aftermath of a devastating flood in Eastern Kentucky and a water shortage in Jackson, Mississippi. Our store, manufacturing and distribution teams went to work to offer company and customer donations of supplies and funds and delivered more than 55,000 gallons of freshwater to both communities when they needed it. A huge thank you for stepping up to support our neighbors when they needed it the most. \n I also want to congratulate our stores once again on achieving 100% execution of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste food rescue. Your efforts provide healthy food directly to our neighbors who need it the most. Thank you for your commitment to creating and supporting communities free from hunger and waste. \n And thanks to everyone again for joining us today. That concludes our second quarter earnings call. \nOperator: Thank you for joining us today. This concludes the Q2 earnings call. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. \n The Kroger team delivered another strong performance during the quarter, fueled by our strategy Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. These consistent results underscore the resiliency and flexibility of our business model, along with our associates' passion to deliver a fresh, convenient customer experience with 0 compromise on quality, selection and affordability.  \n Customers continue to adjust their shopping habits in response to ongoing inflation. We are doing everything we can to help our customers stretch their dollars with high-quality fresh products at everyday low prices and industry-leading fuel rewards program and personalized savings on the items that matter most to them. Our customers are looking for ways to save and we are there for them.  \n During the quarter, digital coupon engagement hit an all-time high with 750 million digital offers downloaded, totaling almost $1 billion in savings. Our fuel rewards program continues to resonate with customers as more than 600,000 incremental households engaged with our fuel rewards program this quarter compared to last year. And our fuel reward redemption rates were also up significantly.  \n We continue to see more customers cooking from scratch and eating out less often. Our broad assortment of products is meeting the need for customers to buy what they want on their terms. For example, some customers are continuing to buy more of their favorite fresh products like apples, tomatoes and grapes. While other customers are choosing products like frozen fruit and vegetables, allowing products to last longer in their homes. Overall, customers are looking to save money and make healthier choices by cooking more meals at home rather than eating out. Kroger's strong value proposition drove positive household growth and meaningful [indiscernible] household growth both online and in-store.  \n Digital sales also returned to positive growth, driven by our one-of-a-kind boost membership program and expansion of our Kroger delivery network. It's clear our go-to-market strategy is connecting with customers, and we continue to build long-term customer loyalty through Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and our Seamless ecosystem.  \n Leading with Fresh, we are dedicated to serving our customers the freshest products so when they think food, they think Kroger. To achieve this goal, we are utilizing technology and deploying fresh innovation to deliver products faster, which stay fresher longer for our customers to enjoy. And it's working. In our 864 fresh certified stores, customers are purchasing more fresh products and overall store sales are growing faster than the rest of the business. Supply chain remains an important part of our fresh strategy as well. In order to maximize freshness, we are utilizing our data science and collaborating with our partners to minimize [ dwell ] time in our distribution network and maintain the integrity of the cold chain. We are also improving productivity in our supply chain. \n During the quarter, we reduced fuel cost headwinds through technology and process efficiencies, such as controlling more product movement across the value chain and maximizing our trucking capacity. While some categories remain challenging, supplier in-stocks are improving, and we are cautiously optimistic this will continue in the back half of the year.  \n Turning to Our Brands. We saw incredible engagement in Our Brands during the quarter with identical sales growth of 10.2% compared to last year. This increase was led by our Kroger and Home Chef brands. Convenience remains a priority and Home Chef is meeting that need by providing high-quality family meals as a budget-friendly alternative to eating out at restaurants.  \n For other customers who are enjoying cooking from scratch, Our Brands are delivering innovative products at a great value. So Our Brands' product strategy is rooted in quality, providing customers with memorable meal experiences they crave. And these products continue to earn world-class recognition. Most recently, Murray's Cheese varieties won five awards at the highly regarded 2022 American Cheese Society Competition. We were also recognized by Store Brands Magazine with 12 Editors' Picks awards for best new products, the most of any retailer. This recognition focused specifically on food that met customer needs for healthier products.  \n As we continue to look for ways to help our customers stretch their budgets, this quarter, we launched a new portfolio strategy for our opening price point brands. We consolidated 17 legacy brands into 2. Heritage Farm for our fresh and dairy product lines; and our newest brand, Smart Way for our nonperishable items. These brands are competitively priced and meet the needs of customers on a [indiscernible] budget. We launched with 150 SKUs and expect to roll out additional products by the end of the year.  \n Now moving to digital. We achieved positive sales growth, as I mentioned before, led by our strong delivery results. Early in the second quarter, we introduced our Boost membership nationwide, and it's already showing promising results including an increase in overall household spend among members. We remain focused on adding new members and are encouraged that enrollment is in line with our internal expectations and projections.  \n During the quarter, we opened a new Customer Fulfillment Center powered by Ocado's automated Smart Platform in Romulus, Michigan. Additionally, we are excited to expand the Kroger delivery network to more customers in four new geographies during the quarter through spoke facilities in Austin, Birmingham, Oklahoma City and San Antonio. This brings our total CFC and spoke count to 18.  \n We also continue to invest in our pickup business, where demand remains strong. During the quarter, we increased capacity and shortened wait times to improve our customer experience. We also invested in technology and implemented process efficiencies, which helped lower our cost to serve.  \n Our customers are telling us they love our Seamless experience. We continue to see customers effortlessly shift between store, pickup and delivery, which is building loyalty. We continue to improve the experience. And we'll always encourage our customers to shop with us how they want to and with 0 compromises.  \n Our associate dedication and passion continue to fuel Kroger's consistently strong results, and we are proud to invest in our teams and improve the associate experience. We saw more people apply to work at Kroger this quarter as we continue to attract talented associates.  \n Our current associates, we are making progress on retention. We've rolled out improved onboarding guidelines and implemented career planning tools. In addition, as part of our commitment to associate wellness, we recently introduced a new financial coaching service tool for hourly associates. This unique benefit offers free financial planning assistance to our associates. We are launching the tool in three pilot divisions and look forward to expanding the service across the company by January of 2023.  \n It is always exciting to see our associates' commitment to creating an outstanding work environment recognized. For the third consecutive year, Kroger was named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, earning a perfect score on the 2022 Disability Equity Index. Additionally, the Brandon Hall Group, a leading human capital management firm, honored Kroger for our training programs and the ways in which our teams promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Each team member is involved in creating our culture where associates come for a job and discover a career.  \n Our Purpose: to Feed the Human Spirit inspires our team every day. One important way we bring our purpose to life is through Kroger's comprehensive ESG strategy. Our aim is to achieve lasting positive change for people and our planet. Our newly published 2022 ESG report called Nurturing Shared Values, outlines the entire Kroger family strong progress against dozens of environmental sustainability, social impact and governance goals and commitments.  \n We continued working to operationalize and integrate ESG within our business. Nowhere is this more evident than through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. This month marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste. And while we still have much -- so much more work to do to achieve our moonshot goal of achieving a world free from hunger and food waste, we also have so much to celebrate. Over the past 5 years, our team donated 2.3 billion meals to our neighbors in need, which included $1 billion in giving to fight food and security, 500 million pounds of surplus food donated to our food bank partners and nearly $45 million in grants to support food recovery and system change from our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation. And I'm very proud to share for the first time ever, our store teams achieved 100% execution of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste food rescue, which is the strongest proof point yet of the value of operationalizing ESG. It took all of our teams working cross-functionally to achieve this important milestone. A huge congratulations and thank you to all involved.  \n In summary, Kroger delivered another strong second quarter. We continue to delight our customers, strengthen our business model and execute on our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. We remain focused on delivering for our associates, customers and communities. And when we do that well, deliver value for our shareholders.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our second quarter financials. Gary? Thanks, Gary. \n The Kroger team successfully navigated another quarter in a dynamic operating environment with strong results. As our customers continue to deal with high inflation, our value proposition is resonating with them. And this reflects the balance we've built into our model. We have demonstrated the ability to offer customers fresh, affordable food and the value they need to help them manage their budgets while we continue to invest in our associates, reinvest in our business and consistently generate strong results. Our performance gives us the confidence that we have the right plan in place to build on our momentum and continue delivering value for all stakeholders.  \n So with that, Alex, we'll turn it over for questions. I'll start on that and let Gary add some more of the details. The biggest part of the drive in improving trends is continued improvement in our loyal household growth and total household of people coming to our stores. We continue to see average transaction size smaller as people come into the store more often and more frequent. We would continue with some headwinds from the nonfood products as well. \n Gary, any additional insights you want to provide? Yes. The only other thing that might be helpful insight, John, is it's pretty consistent across the country as well. Yes. If you look, one of the things that our teams have done a nice job is on procurement. The other piece would be, as you mentioned, mix. The fresh departments continue to help on mix. And we continue to see a lot of customers continue to add value-added products as well. \n I don't know Gary, any additional comments? Gary, go ahead. Yes. Just a couple of additional things. And Gary mentioned one of these in his prepared remarks, but the organization still has incredibly strong cost control, and this will be the fifth year in a row that we've been able to get over $1 billion of cost out. Obviously, that's an important part of that. And we do expect alternative profit to continue to be a little strong, a little bit stronger in the second half of the year as the first half of the year as well. Yes. If you look, the thing that I think is always important is Ocado is one part of our overall digital strategy. And the thing that we're wanting to make sure that we have is a seamless ecosystem where customers can easily go between delivery, pickup and shopping in stores. And what we find is, by far, the majority of the people that -- customers that stop engaging with us on pickup come back into store and we capture that in-store versus delivery. So when you look at the overall seamless system, we're really focused on how do we -- and that's one of the reasons we introduced Boost, is how do we have that total loyalty across all the engagements with the customer. \n If you look at -- the thing that I'm super proud of our teams on the sheds that as we open them in the spokes is our Net Promoter Score from those continue to be world-class and incredibly strong. And that business -- and the customer continues to engage more frequently with us there. And overall, I'm pleased with the results, but we still obviously have plenty of work to do. \n I don't know, Gary, anything else you want to add to the question? Yes, if you look overall, we continue to be satisfied with inflation and the pass-through. As Gary and I both mentioned, we're doing everything we can to minimize those increases and do it in a way that helps the customer in any way we can. And when you look at the total value proposition, we feel very good. When you look at fuel rewards, as I mentioned, we had 600,000 incremental households engaging in fuel rewards and record redemption from customers as well. \n So overall, we're doing -- I feel very good about the ability to balance all the pieces and minimize the impact on the customer as much as we can. We feel very comfortable with our price gaps. And price gaps is with a multiple of different competitors is something that we track on an ongoing basis. And we feel good about the everyday price gap. And as you know, we get great feedback from customers on our promotional approach and customers really appreciate the promotional values that we offer as well to allow customers to stock up on items they use the most. \n And we are very focused on using our data to make sure our offers are personalized for each household individually and discounts that just apply to them. And that's probably part of what's driving the fact that we had 750 million coupons downloaded as well. Yes, I'll answer the first part of that and let Gary answer the second part of your question, Spencer. We continue to ramp up and the ramp in new markets would be among some of the best [indiscernible] sheds across the Ocado network. And as I mentioned before, the NPS scores are outstanding, a world-class or whatever positive you want to assign to them. And as customers engage with us with our Boost membership or our membership programs, that's causing them to even be more loyal as well. \n In terms of the financial side, Gary, I'll let... Part of it, Michael, is we're starting to cycle higher inflation a year ago. So it's really -- we do not expect inflation on inflation to be as high. So it's really driven by the cycling of where we were a year ago. And as you would recall, as we get later in the year, inflation ramped up very aggressively in the back half of last year. We expect the business to continue to stay strong and continue to make strong progress. We just don't expect the inflation to be quite as high as it was. \n The first part of your question, Gary, you may have been able to just -- yes, you're kind of working in and out. Well, obviously, all -- everything that you asked would have been reflected in our guidance for the balance of the year. We would -- most CPGs, you know well in advance of cost increases. So you're balancing the actual getting the cost increase along with what you pass through to customers. Obviously, you are -- on a weekly basis, you're looking at what pricing, where you are on spreads, better or worse than your competitors. \n And the other thing that I think it's always important to remember for a customer that shops at Kroger, there's personalized rewards that are individualized for each household that the market would never see. And that's something that's incredibly valuable for our customers in addition to our fuel rewards and other pieces. So I think you really have to look at the total value proposition. If you look at customer behavior, they're telling us they're modifying behavior more so outside of the grocery store than with us. Now the movement to Our Brands, what we always find is customers do it initially to save a little bit of money, but they fall in love with the product. So part of the continued acceleration of growth in Our Brands is driven by the value, but part of it is just the quality of the product. And that's been something that's been a long-term trend, not just a current trend. \n The customers -- it's one of the reasons why we're so proud of our overall offering is customers can move between different types of product. But we still see customers engaging in things that are fresh, and are healthy, those aspects as well. So we're going to be there forever how the customer wants and needs us to be, and we're going to be very agile as well. Yes, it's a great question, Ken. And it's really broad-based. And the banner brand, I wouldn't say it's a surprise, but the banner brand continues to gain solid share. But even if you look at like private selection, which has a lot of unique and new products, the growth there continued to be strong as well. So it was very broad-based across really the whole store. The majority is consolidating the sub-brands, just making it easier to shop. Those items are always great value for the money. The other thing that there would be incremental items introduced under the Smart Way brand in terms of just the absolute number of SKUs. So it's really a combination of introducing some new items and consolidating several sub-brands and making it easier for customers to shop. Thanks, [ Brandon ], for the question. The other thing I think is important that I mentioned earlier is that we had household growth overall and loyal household growth as well, which is always important for the future. Yes. The gap has continued to narrow and it's narrowed during the quarter as well. And if you look at it for the balance of the year, our teams would expect to continue to make progress and really proud of where we are. And we think the overall value for the customer and the overall seamless experience and focus on fresh continues to accelerate, and the customer continues to reward us for that as well. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. \n And as you know, I always like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in as well. We are so proud of everything that everyone's achieved in this half of the year. Our outstanding associates continue to provide a world-class customer experience. And thank you directly on behalf of everyone for everything that you do for our community, our customers and each other every day. \n I'd also like to take a moment to recognize our Louisville and Delta divisions and our manufacturing and distribution teams who responded immediately to help in the aftermath of a devastating flood in Eastern Kentucky and a water shortage in Jackson, Mississippi. Our store, manufacturing and distribution teams went to work to offer company and customer donations of supplies and funds and delivered more than 55,000 gallons of freshwater to both communities when they needed it. A huge thank you for stepping up to support our neighbors when they needed it the most. \n I also want to congratulate our stores once again on achieving 100% execution of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste food rescue. Your efforts provide healthy food directly to our neighbors who need it the most. Thank you for your commitment to creating and supporting communities free from hunger and waste. \n And thanks to everyone again for joining us today. That concludes our second quarter earnings call."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. \n The Kroger team is laser-focused on executing our go-to-market strategy, which we outlined at our Investor Day in March. Our balanced business model has proven to be resilient in a variety of operating and economic environments, and our second quarter performance provided another proof point of this as we delivered significant year-over-year growth.\n I'll now provide additional color on our second quarter results. We achieved strong identical sales growth without fuel of 5.8% and saw momentum build throughout the quarter. Our Brands led the way with identical sales growing 10.2%. We believe the unmatched combination of innovation, quality and value provided by Our Brands is a clear competitive advantage as inflation remains front of mind for many of our customers.  \n Adjusted EPS was $0.90 for the quarter, an increase of 13% compared to the same quarter last year and ahead of our internal expectations. These results were driven by increased sales of our fuel, disciplined margin management and strong fuel profitability.  \n Our seamless digital ecosystem is critical to building deeper customer loyalty and accelerating market share growth. During the quarter, digital sales grew 8%, led by strength in delivery solutions, which grew by 34%. We continue to invest in digital growth initiatives, including the expansion of our Kroger Delivery network in new and existing geographies, investments in the customer value proposition via Kroger Boost membership and the expansion of customer trip missions, including meal solutions and Kroger Delivery Now. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our positive momentum in digital sales will continue in the second half of the year.  \n Kroger Health also contributed meaningfully to our second quarter results as we grew the profitability of our core pharmacy business. This allowed us to cycle the impact of higher COVID-19 vaccine revenue from a year ago, which is especially impressive given the number of [ vaccinations ] administered last year.  \n Gross margin was 20.9% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. This result reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost inflation through strong sourcing practices while helping customers manage their budgets and keeping prices competitive.  \n Our team is doing an outstanding job navigating the current inflationary environment. We are experiencing the benefits of a multiyear journey in enterprise sourcing that is delivering significant and sustainable savings for Kroger and our customers. Our personalized pricing strategy is enabling us to maximize the reach and effectiveness of our promotional investments to drive loyalty and deliver value for our customers in ways they value most. Together, this has enabled Kroger to improve our price position relative to our key competitors.  \n Due to continued heightened levels of product cost inflation, we recorded a LIFO charge for the quarter of $148 million compared to $47 million in the prior year. We expect inflation will remain at heightened levels in the second half of the year but moderate on a year-over-year basis as we start to cycle the higher inflation, which began in the third quarter last year.  \n Kroger's OG&A rate increased 36 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven by investments in associates, higher incentive plan costs and strategic investments in various margin expansion initiatives, partly offset by sales leverage and continued execution of cost savings.  \n We continue to identify opportunities to remove costs from our business without affecting the customer experience and they're on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings.  \n As I mentioned a moment ago, the increase in our OG&A rate during the quarter was unusual as it included an accrual catch-up for higher projected incentive costs covering the first half of the year, as well as strategic investments in a number of margin expansion initiatives that will drive future growth. We would expect to achieve year-over-year improvements in our OG&A rate in the second half of the year and for the full year.  \n Turning now to alternative profits. Kroger Precision Marketing continues to increase its relevance with our CPG partners. During the quarter, we saw an increase in brand reinvestment rates as CPGs experienced strong returns on their marketing spend with KPM. Kroger Personal Finance products and services are also connecting well with customers in the current environment, providing even more ways to save. This includes our KPF credit card featuring an introductory $0.55 off per gallon of fuel and our gift card program, which promotionally offers 4x fuel rewards.  \n Fuel remains an important part of our business model and delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our fuel rewards program is a key differentiator to help customers stretch their dollars, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers engage with our fuel rewards program at the highest rate since the start of the pandemic during the second quarter, and this helped to ensure our gallon sales outpace the market.  \n The average retail fuel price was $4.62 this quarter compared to $3.13 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.62 compared to $0.39 in the same quarter in 2021. The strength of our fuel results is a great example of the flexibility that exists within our business model as higher fuel profit fully offset the higher LIFO charge in the quarter and allowed us to reinvest strategically in a number of margin expansion initiatives.  \n Our associates continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and serving our customers, and we are investing in hourly wages to ensure Kroger remains an employee of choice. We're also committed to continuing to invest in our associates and sustainably growing hourly wages. These investments are fully contemplated in our long-term financial model.  \n During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Houston, Memphis, Lake Charles, Shreveport, Las Vegas Clarkson and Meat, Southern California [ Clarkson Meats ] and Indianapolis, covering more than 40,000 associates. In the second half, we plan to complete contract negotiations for Chicago, Columbus, Fort Wayne, Toledo, South Bend and Southern California pharmacists.  \n Turning now to our financial strategy and liquidity. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. As a result of our operating performance and working capital improvements over recent years, our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.63 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Underlying initiatives to improve working capital also helped offset higher inventory balances during the quarter, which were a function of higher product cost inflation and in-stocks returning to pre-pandemic levels.  \n We continue to prioritize capital investments that support our go-to-market strategy and see many opportunities to drive future growth. As we updated in our guidance today, we now expect our range for capital investments for 2022 to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion as various initiatives have been delayed due to supply constraints. \n Earlier this quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend by 24%, reflecting our confidence in our long-range plans and our ability to continue to generate strong free cash flow. The quarterly dividend has grown at a 14% compounded annual growth rate since being reinstated in 2006. And this marks the 16th consecutive year of dividend increases.  \n During the quarter, we also repurchased $309 million of shares and year-to-date, have repurchased $975 million of shares. Earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program.  \n I'd now like to share additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. The Kroger team's consistent execution in our go-to-market strategy is building momentum in our business, which combined with sustained food-at-home trends gives us the confidence to again raise our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 4% to 4.5%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $3.95 to $4.05, representing growth of 7% to 10% over 2021. This outlook includes a year-over-year headwind from LIFO of approximately $100 million in the second half of 2022.  \n In closing, we have the right go-to-market strategy and are operating from a position of strength. Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time.  \n And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. I think you covered most of it, Rodney. As Rodney mentioned, John, we're certainly seeing for our most low shoppers continuing to win that first basket, and we're definitely seeing, as we look at our trends, that's holding up very well compared to what we're seeing overall within the market. And for our most loyal customers, as Rodney mentioned, we're seeing that number grow overall and trips also growing with our customer that most loyal shoppers starting to increase the number of trips into the store as well. So I think they are the key points that I would call out. Yes, I think you picked up the biggest drivers with sourcing and the benefits. It's not so much forward buying but continuing to be really disciplined, John, with how we look at the designer product and how we're managing relationships with our supply partners as well. \n One of the areas I would say, specifically in that, that was a tailwind this quarter versus last quarter is the sourcing team and supply chains working really well together to offset the pressure on fuel costs and making sure that we're improving efficiency in the supply chain and operating at optimum levels to really offset that. And naturally, whereas in the last couple of quarters, supply chain would have been a headwind to gross margin, it was essentially flat this quarter. And that wasn't because fuel costs were not a headwind year-over-year. It was really how we applied our approach to the challenge across sourcing the supply chain to make our operation more efficient. Yes, absolutely. Kelly, thanks for the question. Yes, I think you've actually picked on many of the key points. We would be expecting many of the levers that we've been pulling in managing to grow sales and grow customer loyalty and manage the margin performance in the business will be consistent in the back half of the year. The key elements that we called out are what would optically make our EPS growth look less meaningful in the second half. \n First of all, as you mentioned, our total LIFO charge for the year is about a $250 million headwind for the whole year, which translates to about $100 million, so about $0.10 of EPS impact in the back half of the year. \n On fuel, we haven't changed our view. [ Fuel's ] been very difficult to predict, and we don't want to kind of rely on potential upside in fuel when it really isn't something that we -- while the team does a great job of managing the best in the conditions, we don't lead, obviously, on fuel pricing. Our reward program, which really what drives our strategy in fuel. So we're assuming, as we cycle $0.43 to $0.44 of CPG profit from the back half of last year, but if fuel rates more sort of return to normalized levels, then that would be a $50 million to $60 million headwind in the back half of the year. \n So there's about $0.16 of EPS headwinds that we have built in today for LIFO. Were it not for those two, then essentially our EPS would be sort of in the 6% to 8% growth range very much in line with our TSR. So we do still expect the underlying profitability of our supermarket business to improve in the back half of the year as we exclude LIFO and fuel. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Just a couple of things. Overall, I would say, Kelly, we're pleased with the progress that we saw in the quarter. As you heard me mention in my prepared comments, we're certainly starting to see some traction on some of the key initiatives that we've been investing in, whether it's the Customer Fulfillment Centers that are powered by Ocado in both new and existing markets, the launch of Boost and as Boost continues to ramp up and we see about 25% of customers that sign up for Boost are completely new to digital. So that's a really good driver of the digital business as well. \n And then we're still in the early infancy stages of some of those convenience trip missions that I mentioned, whether it's Kroger Delivery Now with our partnership with Instacart, where products can be delivered, smaller baskets, within 30 minutes, and also the meal solutions, things like sushi and [indiscernible]. So a lot of really exciting developments and activities that we're focused on, and we saw some good momentum in those areas coming through, which is why we also shared in my prepared comments that we'd expect the momentum to continue in the back half of the year. \n I think the only other comment I would make is that we are taking a step back certainly to figure out what is the overall market digital growth is likely to look like this year because Rodney mentioned during his prepared comments that we're building a seamless ecosystem for the customer and what we're seeing and customers are moving between the channels and making the decisions of where they shop. And ultimately, we want to make sure the customer will go to Kroger and they're choosing to shop through the store or pickup or delivery, whatever works for them. And we certainly have certain assumptions around how we thought the digital market will grow this year, and we've sort of taken a step back as we look at the back half of the year and really sort of assess how we think the market overall is growing. But our focus is really on making sure that seamless ecosystem is winning the customers' loyalty overall, whichever channel they choose to shop through. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. I wouldn't say, Spencer, if there's anything dramatically changed in our view that we shared previously around how we think about the CFCs powered by Ocado maturing over time. I think, as Rodney mentioned, we've certainly been pleased with what we're seeing with customer connection and sales trends. And when we think about the Net Promoter Scores and the value that we're offering, we're seeing that the gross margin profile, if you like, of that customer and also the growth that we have expected is very much in line with what we have originally envisaged. \n As you know, I think one of the key things for us with the big facilities is it is a 4 to 5-year journey as you're building to maturity and building to scale. And so there are some elements of that, that until you kind of understand what the customer density looks like at scale, we're still figuring out some of that operational efficiency in the model. So there's nothing really new I would call out, but we continue to work on building that full picture. And as you know, in the first two facilities, we're only 18 months really in that journey of a 4-year journey overall to get to capacity. But generally, I'd say still consistent with what we shared previously. Yes. Michael, I think we tend not to look at it specifically in the way that you're describing at that 3-year view. But I would say that overall, we think about our progress in the second quarter, we believe we were able to accelerate our growth relative to Q1 compared to the market. So we felt that from everything you could see, we were able to win customers and to change trajectory versus how the market was moving from Q1 to Q2. So we feel very positive about the momentum that we saw in the business in Q2. \n And as Rodney mentioned, we believe that momentum will continue in the back half of the year, but we are expecting while inflation will remain at heightened levels, we think it will start to taper out because with the cycling, call it, 4% higher inflation in the back half of last year compared to the first half of last year. So even if inflation does continue to grow, you're cycling about 4% higher inflation rate from the prior year. \n And we are starting to see a little bit of data that would say it's really hard to predict, and none of us had our perfect crystal ball. But if you look at the growth in cost inflation from Q1 to Q2, it would be less than the growth that we saw in Q4 last year to Q1 this year. And some of the forward-looking futures data on some of the key commodities are starting to show a little bit of signs that things may be leveling off somewhat. So obviously, there's been plenty of shocks in the last 12 months that can change that very quickly. But the data points that we can see right now, we think it's appropriate to forecast and provide guidance that it seems slightly tapering to the inflation rate in the back half of the year. Yes. Maybe just to add, Rodney, I think, Michael, from the perspective of how we manage gross margin, I think of it much more of a -- we're not trying to manage to a number every quarter. Obviously, we're managing it more long term and there's lots of moving parts that we manage. The tailwinds would be the work we do in sourcing, the mix improvements through fresh growing and Our Brands growing and new innovation products. And of course, things like alternative profit streams adding to that model as well. So we're still investing in the customer. And from our perspective, we feel very good about our ability to manage the model through the evolving environment. \n And overall, again, if you look at our rolling 12 months of gross margin, it's probably in that sort of 10 to 20 basis points of investment. And I think that's what we shared at the beginning of the year where we expect it to be. So we are delivering, we believe, on the plan that we shared. Yes. I mean I think from what we see, we wouldn't expect it to be that dramatic a change. As I mentioned, I think we would expect there to be some flattening out of inflation in the back half of the year, but there's nothing that we see right now that would cause us to believe there's going to be a dramatic change in the level of inflation in the back half of the year. \n And from our perspective, I think it probably ties back to Rodney's earlier comment, we feel that we're monitoring and using our data very closely to adapt as to how customers change behavior. And we believe through the combination of fuel rewards, through the Our Brands portfolio of products that we offer and through the pricing and promotional offers that we have, we've got a very strong sort of portfolio of plans to be able to adapt to the customer with us. Yes. Thanks, Ken. I think what I would say is overall, if you think about there's probably three pieces that impacted OG&A materially during the quarter. The one you mentioned, which was the true-up for the first half of the year on our incentive calculation based on our improved performance, we calculate what the [indiscernible] would be for the year. And so we have to catch up for the first 2 quarters in the year. \n Secondly, as you mentioned, we invested in some strategic initiatives that we believe will accelerate growth as we look into '23 and beyond in particular, and I'll come back to that in a second. The third would be, we were cycling 1 or 2 items that were -- as of the timing were particularly strong in Q2 last year. So when you add those three things together and sort of remove them from the number, we would have achieved an improvement in the OG&A rate during the quarter, which is why we kind of guided you to when we take out those three factors, which wouldn't repeat in our view for the rest of the year, but we would expect overall for the rest of the year to see OG&A rate improvement. It's probably fairly flat in Q3, but likely to be meaningfully better than that in Q4 is how we would think about it. And I wouldn't want to get into maybe breaking down the digital because we typically don't do that. But I would just say that all three of those together will really what caused the increase in the rates. \n As regards to the new initiatives, I think it is more of what you've seen before. It's more just that as we look at how the customer is changing and our business model continues to evolve. We identified 2 or 3 areas where we think there are opportunity to accelerate. And an example would be in shrink and investing in some new capabilities to be able to continue to improve shrink performance as we look out for the forecast for our model on shrink and that, of course, helps gross margin as well. \n And then I mentioned earlier, but we're really pleased with the progress that we made in health and wellness during the quarter, and we made some strategic investments in the health and wellness space where we believe there's an opportunity for us to continue to drive profitable growth, not only in the second half of this year as we cycle the vaccines for last year but also beyond in 2022 and 2024. I wouldn't say, Robert, really changes our view of the opportunity ahead of us. As you know, we've laid out a clear plan at our Investor Day in March, and we still feel really confident in both the growth model that we outlined and where we believe the strategic investments will make sense across the supply chain, across our store portfolio and obviously continue to invest in digital. So I wouldn't read into it that we're any less excited or have less confidence in those plans. It's far more the former point that you made. But when we look at some of the short-term supply challenges, when we look at some of the costs in the market in the short term, it just made more sense in our view to balance that plan and to adjust the schedule. So it would be far more in that camp than the other. Sure. Yes. Overall, our team did a fantastic job in managing fuel margins. And as I think you probably know, we -- our goal is to make sure we're very competitive on price, and then we give significant value back to our customers via our fuel rewards program that flows through our supermarket gross margin, not through that fuel P&L that we share -- the metrics that we shared on the call. So overall, last quarter would certainly have been some great work by our team in capturing value wherever they go through sourcing of fuel and how we promoted and drove engagement with customers. But a lot of it is also just to do with the volatility in the market and as prices were changing in the fuel market, which I think has been seen across the industry. \n So as we look forward, we believe we have a clear strategy around delivering great value for the customer, making sure we're sourcing the product really effectively, optimizing the reward program. Our view at some point is that fuel margins sort of normalize, and we don't think it's prudent for us to predict these extremely high unusual levels of profitability. So I wouldn't say we have perfect insight into what will happen to fuel margins in the back half of the year. We think it's prudent to bring them back to more of what we thought would be a normal rate at the beginning of the year. If it turns out that there is significantly greater margins on fuel then, of course, that would impact our outcome for the rest of the year, but we think it would be not prudent for us to be forecasting that. That's really how we think about the rest of the year. Yes. I think just a bit of color maybe to the last comment, we mentioned on this one would be that our sales growth was higher than the increase that we saw from Q1 to Q2, was higher than the increase we saw in cost inflation. So overall, we're pleased with the trajectory in our growth. And we believe compared to the market, we were able to improve our trajectory, Q2 versus Q1 compared to how the market overall performed. I think, Rupesh, like I mentioned earlier, we feel very good about the plans we have to achieve our long-term -- or our overall TSR model around the growth that we've shared around growing earnings at 3% to 5% and our TSR at 8% to 11%. And we've got, I think, some very clear capital expenditure plans that we believe will allow us to drive that sustained growth. \n So I think we are being deliberate in the short term about making sure the -- if the pricing of certain supplies and products just would change their return materially then we're adjusting our timing there, and there are some challenges just around labor and raw materials and getting the plans executed in the time scale that we'd originally envisaged. But I don't think for us, we look at the announcements that we made this morning on our latest forecast of CapEx as being less excited about the prospects of investing in the business for growth. I think it's more of a function of just some of the short-term headwinds for us."

[Operator Instructions]  \n I will now hand over to your host, Rob Quast, Director of Investor Relations. Over to you, Rob. \nRob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rodney McMullen; and our Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.  \n Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information.  \n After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] In response to your feedback on allowing more participants during Q&A, we may provide abbreviated responses to your follow-up questions to hear from as many of you as we can.  \n I will now turn the call over to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're off to a great start in 2022, delivering strong performance by successfully executing our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. Our associates' relentless focus on providing fresh, affordable food to our customers is driving our strong results.  \n During the quarter, we demonstrated the resilience of our business model led by strong top line sales ahead of internal expectations. In addition, our team navigated a challenging operating environment characterized by continued inflationary cost pressures and supply chain headwinds, which included higher diesel fuel costs. Through our strategic cost savings execution and sustained food-at-home trends, our team delivered 16% growth in adjusted FIFO operating profit, providing once again the strength of our financial model in a variety of operating environments.  \n Our teams are focused on delivering a great customer experience with 0 compromise. Rising inflation, as consumers rethinking their shopping and eating habits, while customers continue to cook more, we are seeing different shopping behaviors based on how individual customers are experiencing the current inflationary environment.  \n Many customers continue to shop premium products throughout the store, including Private Selection, Murray's Cheese and deluxe meal solutions. For other customers whose budget are more directly impacted by food and fuel inflation, they are actively looking for ways to save. We're doing everything we can to help this customer stretch their budgets.  \n I'd like to share more about the work we're doing for our customers and how our competitive moats uniquely position us to meet these challenging and changing customer needs.  \n First, we are leading with fresh. Our customers continue to prioritize fresh as the #1 determinant of where to shop. We are meeting their needs with operational efficiencies and new technologies that extend days of freshness and grow our selection of quality fresh products.  \n In the first quarter, we achieved 5.2% identical sales growth in our fresh categories. These gains were led by the expansion of our End-to-End Fresh Produce program, which elevates standards and improves our ability to maintain freshness throughout the supply chain.  \n We certified 355 stores this quarter, and the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We also continue to increase our use of forecasting and analytical tools, specifically leveraging 84.51\u00b0 to improve our ability to maintain fresh products in stock, both in store and online.  \n Our recent floral results are a great example of how we are leading with fresh. As the nation's largest florist, the first quarter was our time to shine for holiday celebrations and our floral team stepped up, achieving record sales. In fact, we set an overall single-day floral sales record on Valentine's Day and a Mother's Day sales record with strong double-digit growth.  \n Second is Our Brands. During the quarter, we saw tremendous growth in Our Brands, which had identical sales of 6.3% and outpaced all national brands. With 92% of households purchasing at least one of these products, we launched 239 new and innovative products during the quarter, reflecting many of the top food trend predictions we made at the beginning of the year. All of our new products continue to be tested and validated to ensure that they are as good or better than the comparable national brand. We continue to invest heavily in the quality of Our Brands, which preserves our strong price position and drives higher profitability.  \n Next area is personalization. Our data science platform provides unique insights that creates personalized customer experiences. In this dynamic environment where customer behaviors are changing rapidly, we use our data and insights to be nimble and react quickly to ever-changing needs. Our broad-based data science approach helps us determine how to best implement price, promotion and display.  \n We are focused on delivering incredible value to our customers through relevant personalized offers and fuel rewards. Our loyal customers are using our fuel rewards program now more than ever and, in fact, more than 600,000 incremental households engaged for the first time this quarter.  \n Finally, our seamless ecosystem continues to deliver fresh products to our customers anytime, anywhere and with 0 compromise.  \n During the first quarter, more customers returned to in-store shopping. And as a result, we made strides to enhance that experience while introducing new tools that help our associates better serve customers. In pickup, we unveiled new technology that improved wait times 20% and expanded capacity based on customer needs. In delivery, we continue to introduce key initiatives that expand our reach and shorten delivery times. We strive to provide more customers access to high-quality, affordable food regardless of whether they have a physical store in their community.  \n During the quarter, we opened 2 new customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado's automated Smart Platform, one in Dallas, Texas and one in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, bringing our total CFC count to 5.  We also opened 3 new spoke locations for a total of 6 spokes.  \n As we head into summer, our end-to-end cold solutions, including the custom-built refrigerated van, will ensure customers get the freshest product delivered directly to their doorstep.  \n Finally, our Boost membership is delivering promising results. Our one-of-a-kind membership program offers incredible value where customers can get unlimited free delivery on orders of $35 or more, double the fuel points on every dollar spent at Kroger and other exclusive member benefits.  \n We are encouraged by the number of new members in the 4 current pilot divisions. Importantly, delivery sales increased significantly compared to non-Boost divisions and delivery retention improved approximately 600 basis points.  \n Because of this early success, we are proud to announce today that Kroger Boost is launching nationwide beginning in the next few weeks. This next-generation loyalty program is deepening our relationships with customers as they continue to look for value and convenience.  \n Turning to supply chain. Our 2022 business plan anticipated ongoing supply chain challenges. By planning ahead and focusing on staffing, technology and process efficiencies, we manage our costs effectively. By owning and operating a portion of our fleet, we better control and manage transportation costs  despite diesel fuel cost headwinds. \n We were also proactive about forward buying and securing capacity for goods, resulting in better vendor rates. Through our supplier relationships, we saw sequential improvement in product availability. We are well positioned to adapt to the evolving environment, and we are cautiously optimistic in a broader supply chain recovery throughout the year.  \n We also continue to invest in our associates and an associate experience that facilitates an amazing customer experience. We firmly believe that exceptional financial and operating performance connects directly to the ways we support and invest in our associates.  \n During the quarter, we took numerous steps to meet our associates' needs while they delivered for our customers. We continue to invest in associate wages and we expect hourly wages to grow throughout the year.  \n We launched new initiatives to simplify day-to-day work, including the modernized scheduling tool, MyTime. We took steps to improve communication across all of our teams and bring meaningful training to all of our associates no matter where they work. One example of this commitment is the addition of Microsoft Teams Rooms across most of our store locations. This technology improvement will facilitate deeper connections and improve the associate experiences.  \n As an employer of choice, more people are applying to work for Kroger and more associates are choosing to stay with us. While we still have work to do, we experienced a meaningful improvement in both hiring and retention in the months after the Omicron surge. We are also seeing more boomerangs. These are associates who left to work elsewhere and ultimately came back to us. Kroger's strong culture invites associates to come for a job and discover a career. And we're glad that so many value and appreciate our work environment, our culture and the people they work with every day.  \n Our winning culture is rooted in living our purpose to feed the human spirit. During the past last year, our teams took significant steps to support our customers and communities through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan. We introduced a new Kroger and USO co-branded mobile unit to nourish active duty military service members and their families at military bases and USO centers across the country as well as provide community disaster relief. The first of 4 units hit the road in May.  \n In summary, we're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2022. We are widening our competitive moats, creating a shopping experience with 0 compromise, investing where it matters most to our customers and associates and strengthening our purpose in large and small ways every day. When we do all of this well, our teams, our customers and our shareholders all win.  \n Now I'd like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our first quarter results. Gary? \nGary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger delivered another quarter of strong results as our team did an outstanding job executing our go-to-market strategy while navigating a dynamic operating environment. Our results again highlight the strength and resilience of Kroger's financial model, which allowed us to continue to invest in our associates, deliver fresh, affordable food for our customers and create value for our shareholders.  \n I'll now provide more detail on our results in the quarter. Led by our competitive moats, we achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 4.1%. Fresh categories and Our Brands identical sales both outpaced overall company results.  \n Adjusted EPS was $1.45, up 22% compared to the same quarter last year, driven by increased sales and exceptional cost management during the quarter.  \n Digital sales declined 6% in the first quarter, broadly in line with our expectations. We continue to ramp the digital growth initiatives shared at our Investor Day, including enhanced personalization capabilities, Boost membership, customer fulfillment centers and Kroger Delivery Now. As a result of these initiatives, we grew digitally engaged households during the quarter, and we would expect digital sales to accelerate as the year progresses.  \n Gross margin was 21.6% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 26 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily attributable to continued strategic price investments and higher supply chain costs, offset by sourcing benefits and the cycling of a write-down related to a donation of personal protective equipment inventory in the prior year.  \n Our team continues to do an excellent job managing higher product cost inflation. We are leveraging our data and sourcing expertise and working closely with our suppliers to help minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model. We are investing where it matters most to our customers and are using our proprietary data to deliver additional value through personalization.  \n Our Brands are also proving to be an important differentiator for our customers in this environment, providing an unmatched combination of great quality and great value.  \n We will continue to leverage these proven and unique capabilities to help our customers manage their grocery budgets more effectively and maintain a strong value proposition relative to our competitors as we believe inflation will remain front of mind for many of our customers for the remainder of 2022.  \n In recognition of current product cost inflation and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million compared to $37 million in the prior year. This increase represents a $0.06 headwind to EPS in the quarter versus 2021.  \n Our OG&A rate decreased 46 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We were successful in offsetting inflation headwinds in many parts of our business and continued investments in our associate wages by reducing costs in areas that do not impact the customer experience. As an example, this quarter, we introduced a new bakery forecasting tool, which is improving product freshness, reducing waste and, at the same time, simplifying the associate ordering process. We have a strong pipeline of process improvement initiatives and innovative technology-driven solutions that will lower digital fulfillment costs, increase store productivity and reduce waste and shrink.  \n For the fifth consecutive year, we remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings in 2022. The traffic and data generated by our supermarket business continue to create a strong flywheel effect for alternative profits. Led by retail media and Kroger Personal Finance, alternative profits are on track to contribute meaningful growth in 2022.  \n During the quarter, Kroger Precision Marketing added more than 100 new brand partners. We continue to enhance our market-leading capabilities and have entered into new agreements with 3 leading advertising management platforms, allowing our CPG partners to manage their on-site ad campaigns more effectively.  \n Fuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars, especially when fuel prices are high. We continue to deliver significant value through our loyalty program, which saves customers up to $1.25 per gallon. As Rodney shared earlier, more customers engaged with fuel rewards this quarter, and our gallons grew at a faster rate than the market.  \n The average retail price of fuel was $4 this quarter versus $2.79 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.42 compared to $0.35 in the same quarter last year.  \n Our associates continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and serving our customers. we introduced a number of new initiatives to support associates this quarter as well as continuing to invest in hourly wages. These investments are fully contemplated in our guidance and long-term financial model.  \n During the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW in Denver, Southern California, Houston, Little Rock, Memphis and Seattle, covering more than 67,000 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW in Las Vegas, Southern California for Ralphs pharmacies, Indianapolis, Roanoke, Chicago and Columbus.  \n Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.68 compared to 1.79 a year ago. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5.  \n Consistent with our financial strategy, we are investing in the business to drive sustainable future earnings growth and continue to expect capital expenditures of between $3.8 billion and $4 billion in 2022.  \n During quarter 1, we were disciplined in returning cash to shareholders. In total, Kroger returned $819 million via a combination of share repurchases and dividends.  \n We are operating from a position of financial strength and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy excess cash to accelerate our growth model and deliver sustainable total shareholder returns.  \n In closing, let me share additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. While there are a number of uncertainties in the macroeconomic and inflation outlook for the remainder of 2022, Kroger is laser-focused on executing the plans outlined at our Investor Day, and we believe our go-to-market strategy will serve us well in navigating the current environment.  \n Based on the strength of our quarter 1 results and sustained food-at-home trends, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 2.5% to 3.5%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $3.85 to $3.95, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7%.  \n Our updated guidance assumes inflation will remain at tightened levels for the remainder of the year, although we would expect the year-over-year rate to moderate in the second half of the year as we cycle higher inflation from quarter 3 and quarter 4 2021.  \n Due to this higher outlook for inflation, we now expect our LIFO full year charge will be in the range of $300 million compared to $197 million last year. As a reminder, while the actual LIFO charge is calculated at a point in time at the end of our fourth quarter, we recognize the projected charge evenly throughout the year.  \n Our guidance also assumes retail fuel profitability will be a headwind for the remainder of 2022 as we cycle higher CPG margins from 2021.  \n Our full year projected tax rate has been lowered from 23% to 22%, primarily due to higher-than-expected tax deductions related to employee stock option exercises.  \n Overall, we are extremely pleased with our start to the year, which provides another proof point of the strength of our financial model. And looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained earnings growth and total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time.  \n And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. I would like to once again acknowledge and thank our outstanding associates. Their hard work and dedication fuel our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy and our obsession for our customers. We continue finding new ways to help customers stretch their dollars through everyday prices, data-driven promotions, personalized experiences, trusted Our Brand products and a seamless e-commerce platform. We believe this relentless focus on delivering for customers will help us maintain robust sales and drive growth.  \n Moving ahead, we remain confident that we have the right strategy to deliver value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.  \n Now we'll turn to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Robby Ohmes of BofA Global Research. \nRobert Ohmes: Guys, great quarter. My question is, I was wondering if we could get a little more color on the ID sales. So maybe thoughts on what your -- the traffic component of that, what you're seeing in traffic, the ticket component and maybe specifically the inflation component in the ID sales.  \n And then sort of along with that, some of your competitors that sell groceries and food and beverage are seeing very strong sort of double-digit same-store sales. Is the price spread versus your competitors widening because of the price investments you're making? \nW. McMullen: Thanks, Robby, and good morning. If you look at -- in terms of traffic, the 2 areas that we felt really good about is if you look at the number of loyal shoppers we have and our household count, both improved. Now a typical basket size for a customer coming in continues to decline. Part of that is just driven because of the economic environment some customers are having.  \n If you look at identicals during the quarter, toward the end of the quarter, they finished a little stronger than where we were during the quarter, and that's continued so far early in the second quarter. Obviously, we're extremely early in the quarter.  \n Obviously, we do have a reasonable-sized general merchandise business that affect it as well. And the comment that I made in the prepared comments, if you look at our fresh departments, they were up over 5%.  \n So overall, we think the customers are doing a lot of work on balancing their total budget, and we continue to balance it as well with promotions. And then customers are aggressively starting to buy our brands and what they're finding is the quality of that product, and there's no compromise with that versus some of the other products. And if you look at our price spreads, we check pricing, obviously, every week. We look at pricing spreads for different types of customers. And those spreads continue to be where they've been or improving slightly has been the case over the last couple of years.  \n I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? \nGary Millerchip: I think you covered it well, Rodney. The only other point you mentioned around total households and loyal households growing, we also saw visits improving during the quarter as well, Robby, which was -- we were really pleased with that trend as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. \nJohn Heinbockel: Yes. So let me start with our own brand, right? So it looks like own brand is probably growing 2x the rate of national brand. I'm curious, price spreads there, so maybe, Rodney, talk about that. Where you think own brand momentum goes from here? And I know historically, right, you guys have always said that own brand strength leads to increased CPG promotions. Do you think that will be true this time? \nW. McMullen: Yes. I love the question, John. And as you know, we're super proud of our brands and super proud of Private Selection, the banner brand and Simple Truth and then Home Chef is our most recent owned brand. \n The -- that growth has been strong across all components. The only exception of that is Simple Truth was a little soft earlier in the quarter because we did have supply issues with one of the chicken suppliers. But other than that, growth is nice as well. \n As you know, what we've always found is over time, our brands gain share, and that's been true for over 25 years. And when the economy is tight, our brands always gain share. And then once the economy is good, we may lose a little or maintain, but that's been the case all throughout. Because what customers find is once they try it, they love it. \n We -- if you look at our leadership team, our -- we've gone and really upgraded our leadership team in terms of our focus on our brands. And for us, it really is -- we look at it the same as a national brand. Our customers do. And as I mentioned, over 90% of our customers include it in their basket. So feel really good. \n Your second part of your question about the national brand change. I think there's still a lot of capacity constraints among some of the national brands. So I would expect if it's a national brand with capacity, you'll see a typical trend where they get more aggressive in promoting as their tonnage goes down. But if they're supply constrained, I would be surprised. And part of that is just because all of us are exiting COVID at a level of volume higher than what we had going in, which has put different people at different points on supply constraints. \nJohn Heinbockel: A quick follow-up to that. Forward buying, right? Normally, a big P&L benefit in inflationary times. It sounds like today, it's limited, right, because of their capacity constraints? \nW. McMullen: Yes. We do -- the excess warehouse space that we took on as part of COVID, a lot of that space, we've continued to keep. And I would say we're using that space to be able to get product when we can get it. So I think a lot of the CPGs are using it to level out production. So when they have excess production, we're taking that. And it, in essence, becomes forward buy, but I don't think it will be as big as it's been in past situations. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I'll ask my question and follow-up, one shot here. \n First, Rodney, I want to ask about the competitive environment. It feels like it's pretty rational out there, and it seems like the consumer has been price taking for the last, call it, number of months. And even Walmart mentioned 1.5 weeks ago they're not getting in too aggressive on price. I want to ask you, now that the consumer basket or consumer behavior is starting to change, might this environment change? Do we think -- do you think we're at a new normal in terms of promotional activity? Or do you think this is -- yes, I don't want to put it like a house of cards, but it feels like everyone's kind of playing nice and something can break. \nW. McMullen: Yes. Well, it's a good question. And obviously, we always spend a lot of time focused on it. \n Your first comment, we are seeing the competitive environment pretty similar to what it's been. As you know, our go-to-market strategy really is Leading With Fresh. And what we find is it's the most important reason why somebody decides where to shop. And our teams are really working hard to take our fresh experience to the next level, and our customers are telling us they appreciate what they're doing and they're seeing that improvement. \n So when you look at it, we think price is just one component. We're going to make sure that we always maintain a reasonable spread in the things that we're good at with our rewards program, our fuel rewards and our fresh go-to-market strategy. Those things matter, and that's where we're going to win in the marketplace. And we expect that to continue to be important in every imaginable environment going forward. \n So to me, it's one of those things where it's important, we continually check. But we always think it's important to remember it's the total customer experience that we're focused on rather than price alone. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Spencer Hanus of Wolfe Research. \nSpencer Hanus: Can you provide some more color on the FIFO adjusted gross margins in the quarter? Because it looks like that slowed sequentially. And then you said your price gaps are well positioned, but do you think you're going to need to invest further in price in the second half as we just see sort of inflation pick up and that consumer gets under more pressure? \nGary Millerchip: Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, I'll cover that, and Rodney can add any additional color he'd like to. \n Generally, our gross margin rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter. As you heard us share, we had 2 major investments during the quarter, which was investing in value for the customer and also the supply chain headwinds that we -- as Rodney mentioned in his prepared comments, we fully expected during the year. \n Overall, we feel like we were right in line with what we expect it to be. I know we called out in our comments around the PPE inventory write-off, that really wasn't material enough to sort of be something that I think investors should be thinking about is going to be a factor in our expectations for the rest of the year. I think we shared in our original guidance for the year that we believe gross margin would be a headwind during the year as we made the investments in price and supply chain. The first quarter played out largely as we expected. \n We don't call out all the puts and takes in the quarter. And things like COVID vaccines would have been a tailwind last year, that wouldn't have been a tailwind this year. \n So I think there's a lot of extra moving parts in there. And what we try and do is call out the pieces that we've communicated previously so we're consistent and also give you a flavor for the major moving parts. But overall, we felt the quarter was very much in line with strategy, and we wouldn't be pointing to a change in that for the rest of the year. \n I'll maybe just add one piece of additional color because I know it's kind of something I've seen as a sort of question floating around before the call started was, certainly, the gross margin outlook hasn't changed. That's not a factor in how we think our guidance looks for the rest of the year. We're very confident with how we think about the outlook for the rest of the year. \n I think that some of the factors to bear in mind when you think about the second half, I mentioned it in my prepared comments, but LIFO for the year is going to be about $150 million higher than budget and about $100 million higher than prior year spread across the 4 quarters. We do expect fuel margins will be a headwind for the rest of the year and directionally think of that as maybe a $50 million or so headwind as well. \n So I think about it more of the underlying trends that we shared during the quarter is something that we feel is right on track with our plan. But there are some unique factors that will influence the second half of the year. And from our perspective, those are generally going to be things that you won't have to cycle in 2023, but there are obviously headwinds in the rest of this year in terms of our overall financial outlook. \nW. McMullen: The other thing I think it's always important to remember is we always look at gross margin in light of our OG&A cost as well. And obviously, our teams did an incredible job of managing OG&A costs. And we always will invest some of those OG&A savings in trying to extend the customer's budget, especially in an environment like this where it's important. And I think some of those reasons are the reasons why our customer counts have improved as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. \nKaren Short: I have a couple of questions. I just -- and they can all kind of tie into one. But the first is on your actual volume versus your comp. So as you look at your guidance, we know where CPI is and we know what your implied 2Q to 4Q guidance is. So it certainly implies demand destruction from a volume and tonnage perspective. So wondering if you could talk about that. \n And then specifically on your full guide, obviously, we came back into the FIFO guide for operating profit for 2Q to 4Q. It looks like you'll be down about 6% on that operating profit number versus where you were at this quarter which is up around 16%. So wondering if you could triangulate those 2. \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Karen. Yes, I think the first part of the question would be, as I mentioned it a moment ago, around we look at the guidance for the rest of the year. Our overall outlook for inflation is that we do expect inflation is going to be higher for the rest of the year than we originally expected when we sort of entered 2022 and provided our original guidance. \n Having said that, it's important, I think, to remember that we don't have a perfect crystal ball, of course, like all of us are trying to figure out there are multiple scenarios that could play out. I think our central scenario though is that we think inflation will remain higher. But as we cycle about a 4% increase in inflation in the second half of last year compared to the first half of last year, absolute annual inflation, we may well actually start to see a more moderated number in the second half of the year. So we're currently assuming inflation in the second half as a headline rate maybe a couple of percentage points or so lower than the first half of the year. \n So we're actually -- if you think about our sales guidance, we are assuming that we see some momentum in our units because of the way we're thinking about inflation. Now of course, that outcome could be different and that will impact the outcome of the results that we report, but our overall assumption is based on that kind of high-level view, which we think takes into account all the different data points that we've been able to look at both internally and externally. \n And then from an operating profit perspective, as I mentioned a few moments ago, from really the way we think about the rest of the year, our overall EPS guidance, if you kind of look at the midpoint of our new range for the rest of the year, it would be flat to slightly down. I think the really key messages in that would be think about the, as I mentioned a moment ago, the LIFO charge will be having a major impact on that, both versus budget and versus prior year. And as I mentioned, whereas fuel would have been a tailwind in the first quarter, it will actually be a headwind for the rest of the year. So we think of the sort of supermarket business as being robust and relatively on track in terms of what we would have expected and continuing to build momentum. It's really around those other factors that are driving the lack of sort of carryforward of the momentum on year-over-year growth in the first quarter when you look at that relative to the rest of the year. \nKaren Short: As well as the vaccine headwind, correct? \nGary Millerchip: Vaccine headwind would have been in the first quarter probably a factor, and then it would also be a factor in Q2 and Q3. But again, I wouldn't think of that as being a major headwind on what -- so that was probably a bigger factor in Q1 as any quarter. So I wouldn't think of the gross margin performance that we saw in the first quarter of the year as being dramatically different expectation in the remaining quarters based on the impact of vaccine and other factors. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer & Co. \nRupesh Parikh: So I just want to go back to grocery market share. Just want to get a sense of how your markets are held up in the grocery category. And I guess related to that, it sounds like the general merchandise category had some headwinds. So just wondering if that contributed maybe to the weaker ID performance. \nW. McMullen: If you look at grocery market share for the -- overall, it's pretty much close to where we thought it would be. We would expect continued improvement throughout the year, which was reflected in the original guidance. \n Your comment on general merchandise is correct. Our general -- if you look at our identicals in total, without general merchandise, it would be pretty similar to where the fresh IDs were. \n And the general merchandise, obviously, households are starting to change their behavior on shopping and it shows up there. And obviously, some of the savings and things that customers had from not being able to spend money on service as well is showing up there. \n So we are making progress on market share overall and would expect to continue to make marked improvements as we go along in the year. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one quick housekeeping question. I know last quarter, you gave quarterly cadence guidance. Is that still intact on the comp and EPS line? Or I don't know if there's any updated views there. \nGary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. Just briefly, I would say, on the EPS side of things, I mentioned a moment ago, Rupesh, that I think if you look at the guidance for the back -- the last 3 quarters of the year, it would sort of predominantly be around the sort of flat to slightly down. I would think of that, if you look at the cadence last year, it would be relatively consistent if you think about the next 3 quarters. So I wouldn't call out any dramatic year-over-year variance to that overall. \n And then I think on a sales perspective, as we mentioned, we would expect the first half to be a little bit better than the second half in terms of sales. That's predicated on this belief though that inflation continues at heightened levels. But on a year-over-year basis, the back half would be potentially a few basis points lower because we're cycling 4% higher inflation in the second half of last year than the first half of last year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: I wanted to go back to the question on -- I want to go back to the question just on tonnage and underlying unit volume. Rodney, I think when we were sort of all looking at this quarter, I think we would all, on the investor side, agree that we probably thought your ID would be better given the trends that we saw in inflation. And I'm kind of curious as to what you are seeing in underlying tonnage. And then you talked about, I think I heard you right when you said that basket is down despite that backdrop. So I'm just kind of curious as to what you're seeing on like that side. And do you think any -- are you seeing anything that is being caused by changes in consumer behavior, right, whether that's sort of like channel shifting, seeking value, that type of stuff? \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look on the basket size, that's driven by units per basket. And what we're finding is customers are coming in more frequently before but they're not buying as many items on each shop. And that's what we're seeing. \n We're also seeing customers, especially customers that aren't as sensitive to their budget, upscaling with or buying bigger packs, especially earlier in the month when -- depending on when people were getting money. So we continue to see both of those dynamics. If you look at the fresh departments, the trends there would be better than the overall. \n The -- if you look at overall units, we -- for most of the CPG partners, we would be tracking pretty similar to where their unit changes are overall in the marketplace in -- if you look at our top 25. \n I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? And I know you're pulling up some... \nGary Millerchip: Yes. Well, I think just to clarify maybe the comment we made, the total basket size is actually up. It's the number of units in the basket that are down. So if we look at our overall metrics, households are up, loyal households are up, visits have turned positive, basket size is up. But the number of items in the basket, as Rodney mentioned, is the item that I think customers are adapting behavior as they start to manage the inflationary environment. And that's obviously a focus area for us to use data personalization and different tools around rewards to really aim to continue to drive that up. \n And as I mentioned, if you look at our second half guidance as we expect in our current assumption, inflation would be, on a year-over-year basis, maybe not as quite as high even though remaining at sustained levels, then our guidance reflects the expectation that we continue to make progress on that front. \nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I think that you said that you sort of expected the gross margin trend for the rest of the year to be similar to Q1. Did you mean the year-over-year decline? Or did you mean multiyear? Just kind of curious as to what you were talking about there. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. I wouldn't want to get into specific guidance because of the comment that Rodney mentioned around we do try and manage the business dynamically. I think what I was really saying, Ed, was it was specific to the current year. I'm really saying that when you think about Q1, I think there was some concern that the PPE write-down was somehow need to be reversed out and that would be the trend that we're seeing in terms of gross margin rate. So I think the guidance that we shared at the beginning of the year was we expected gross margin to be a headwind. We didn't expect the volatility to be as significant as we've seen in the past. And as I mentioned, the PPE is really one of a number of puts and takes. But because we called it out last year in the first quarter, we didn't want to not clearly mention it again in the current quarter, but I wouldn't see it as a major factor. And so it was related to Q1 was the -- that's the kind of directional shape of gross margin, which is, I think, consistent with what we shared when we gave our guidance for the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore. \nMichael Montani: Just wanted to ask, first off, looking at food-at-home inflation, it looks like it was up just about double digits for your quarter calendarized. And if we adjusted that, given your gen merch mix a little bit, maybe it's a point or 2 below. But just wanted to see, is that kind of the right way to think about what you might have been able to pass through to the consumer given that PPI is so much ahead of those levels? \nW. McMullen: Yes. I always think it's important to look at CPI and PPI together. And it's also the reason why we shared a little bit more details about Our Brands than normal because you have -- customers are doing their own behavior in terms of changing the way they shop. \n So if you think about, in some cases, a national brand item may cost $3 and Our Brand might be $1 or $2. So that would show up and would cause our inflation rate not to be as high as what's in the marketplace. \n I also think it's important to remind people that on -- when you look at Our Brands overall, our gross margin's about 600 basis points better than the national brand. And if you look at profit per item, it's similar or, in many cases, actually higher. \n So to me, I would look at those numbers as general directional things but not specifics to be able to compare directly just because customers' behavior is changing.  And if you look at like in pork, as an example, customers aggressively moved to pork during the quarter. And some of that movement was at the expense of people not buying as much beef because it's a great value for the money, as an example. \n So you have -- within all the data, you have a lot of customer behavior changes. But I think it's helpful directionally, but not exactly. \nMichael Montani: Okay. And then for a follow-up, if I could, was just around the $1 billion plus of gross cost savings. I was just wondering if that would be kind of metered out evenly throughout the course of the year and how it might compare to kind of inflationary pressures you might be seeing in wages and/or transportation with diesel at record highs. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. The $1 billion of savings would certainly be sort of an ongoing flow of initiatives. So certainly think about it as being consistently sort of building from -- so we've got a certain number of benefits from last year that flow through, and then we're introducing new initiatives this year. So because we're on this 5-year journey, $1 billion of savings, it's very much a continual flow of new initiatives that are being implemented in the business to drive those efficiencies and savings. \n So I'd certainly think of it in general terms as being fairly consistently throughout the year. Now of course, there are a number of puts and takes in lines and we continue to invest in average hourly rates. I think we mentioned in the first quarter, there was a benefit from lower pension contributions during the first quarter. So I wouldn't think of the OG&A rate improvement that we saw in Q1 as being typical for the year. But we do expect to continue to see OG&A rate in the year being an improvement and a tailwind for the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. \nMichael Lasser: In light of the perception that your food categories were up, call it, 5% in the quarter and Nielsen was up 6%, the mass merchants were comping and improving leverage up high single, double digits. There's a perception out there, Rodney, that Kroger lost market share during the period. Why would that have been the case? And you made a comment that you expect your market share trends to improve in the next couple of quarters. What do you expect will drive that improvement? \nW. McMullen: If you look, all of us, our quarters end at a little different time. So it's always difficult to be exactly comparison. And I know some of the competitors don't break out specific by category. And I know for us, obviously, general merchandise is a bigger part of our business than some of our traditional competitors, not as much as some of the big-box competitors. \n If you look at during the quarter, our trends improved as we went along during the quarter. As Gary mentioned, our household count went up, increased. Our loyal household count went up. And our visits in total also increased. And our trends improved as well. So those are the things that give us confidence in terms of the things that we're doing and the direction we're headed is continuing to move in the right direction. \nGary Millerchip: Yes. The only other thing maybe I would add, Rodney, is that the comments we made, Michael, about digital growth and the expectation that with the investments we're making in customer fulfillment centers, the announcement -- the exciting announcement that Rodney shared this morning around Boost membership launching across the whole of the company, we feel that the momentum that we're seeing starting to build in digital will also be an important component of that growth in the future as well. \nMichael Lasser: And if I could add a quick clarifying question on that. The perception is also that over the next couple of quarters, economic pressure across a broader swath of consumers, not just those at the lowest income demographic, that pressure is going to increase. And that might push people to shop more at the dollar stores, might push them to shop more at the warehouse clubs, where the perception is that they may be able to stretch their budget a little further. So in response to that, what is Kroger going to need to do, invest more in price, change pack sizes and other actions that could impact its profitability to prevent customers from going elsewhere? \nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Michael. Yes, I think briefly, we see that as an opportunity actually for Kroger because what we tend to see in those more economically challenged times is that the customer that's less stressed, as you described them, actually views Kroger as a high-quality place to get more value compared to maybe shopping a larger number of stores, and we even see it with some of our own brand performance. Rodney mentioned the strong value and ingredients for cooking at home, but we also saw strength during the quarter in Private Selection and Meal Solutions. So we see that as an opportunity for us to really connect with that customer as they start to maybe determine the best place to shop for quality and value combined. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how conversations are going with your vendor partners currently, especially in light of the ongoing inflation to the second half. Have you been able to push back with regards to some of the cost inflation? And will you be getting more aggressive in those conversations like some of your competitors have suggested? \nW. McMullen: It's an ongoing dialogue. And obviously, overall, we try to make sure that we have a partnership relationship. It's also one of the values in having Our Brands so it's such a strong component. So we understand true cost increases versus somebody just wanting to raise margins. \n In many cases, with the CPG partners, we're identifying areas where we can work together to take costs out so that we can reduce it. And like on backhauls is an area that we're making great progress on by using technology, both of our technologies and databases, to understand how to change. \n I would say that we're going to always push back on any type of cost increase that's not justified. And we're going to also try to work together to figure out a way to reduce our combined costs whenever we can. \n I think it's a difficult answer to say how are we doing versus competition or competitors. I'm super proud of our procurement team. As Gary mentioned earlier, one of the big component on the cost saves is renegotiating both things not for resell and resell [ both ]. So we feel good about where we are, but it's an ongoing dialogue. And obviously, it's a little more difficult dialogue when you have such high inflation. \nKatharine McShane: And if I could just ask an unrelated follow-up. Just with regards to the Boost rollout, are there any more details with regards to the timing of that? And I know there was higher retention and other metrics you cited, but was there also a comp lift impact from Boost during the quarter in those 3 test regions? \nW. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the test regions, it would positively affect our identicals. And the thing that's most important to us is it causes that customer to be stickier to our overall ecosystem, not just on delivery. So -- and our strategy is that if a customer thinks food, we want them to think Kroger. So we feel good about where we are and it's continued in the right direction. \nOperator: Our final question for today comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. \nCharles Cerankosky: Rodney, if you talk about your e-commerce sales, they were down 6% overall. Can you shed some light on the components of that because I don't think it reflects what's going on with the new CFCs and spokes. So where is the negative numbers coming from? And how are the -- how is the Ocado-based facilities performing? \nW. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Chuck. If you look at -- pickup would be the area where we would have the biggest decline. And what -- as I mentioned, what we're finding is that customer, as they get comfortable, they move back into stores. And the retention rate is better than the overall retention rate. \n If you look at the sheds, the NPS scores continue to be outstanding. The retention rate and repeat purchase rate on the sheds is very strong. And they're continuing to move in the right direction. \n And if you look toward the end of the quarter in the recent few weeks, our performance on year-on-year for online has actually turned to positive. \n So the first quarter was pretty similar to where we thought it would be because we were cycling some strong numbers early in the quarter, and the trend has moved back into the positive neighborhood. So thanks, Chuck. \nCharles Cerankosky: And then on the increase in working capital dollars spent during the quarter, does a lot of that simply reflect inflation? Or are you -- is Kroger, in fact, getting more aggressive on forward buying or just trying to grab stuff when it's available? \nGary Millerchip: Chuck, yes, I think there's a couple of different factors just briefly in there. Overall, we've been on a plan for a number of years to continue to optimize working capital. So I wouldn't say it's a dramatic change in strategy. We're very focused on continuing to drive improvements there and have seen good tailwinds in our cash flow because of that. \n This quarter, we would have seen an increase in inventory. Part of that would be to do with sort of starting to get back towards pre-COVID levels as the in-stock and supply chain improves. Nothing that would be concerning to us from a sell-through perspective, but we do think it's important to make sure we continue to improve the supply chain. And of course, inflation would have also impacted that number as well, but nothing out of the ordinary. \nW. McMullen: Thank you for -- to everyone for joining us today. I am incredibly proud of the way we are beginning in 2022, with a continued focus on our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy. \n As always, I'd like to share a few comments with our associates listening in. First, obviously, thank you. The past several years have been challenging and weighed on all of us differently. While each of us react in a unique way, no one should have to struggle alone. That's why we offer a variety of resources, from in-person and virtual counseling sessions through our well-being assistant, to tools to help leaders of others foster a supportive environment. I would encourage each of us to take time to ensure we have the support systems we need in place. And if we don't, please ask for help. We are all our best advocates and know what truly we need. Thank you for everything you do for each other. Thank you for what you do for our customers every day. And thank you for what you do for our communities every day. I'm inspired every single day of the week by your amazing work that you do. \n Thanks again for joining us today, and that concludes our first quarter earnings call. \nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "W. McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're off to a great start in 2022, delivering strong performance by successfully executing our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. Our associates' relentless focus on providing fresh, affordable food to our customers is driving our strong results.  \n During the quarter, we demonstrated the resilience of our business model led by strong top line sales ahead of internal expectations. In addition, our team navigated a challenging operating environment characterized by continued inflationary cost pressures and supply chain headwinds, which included higher diesel fuel costs. Through our strategic cost savings execution and sustained food-at-home trends, our team delivered 16% growth in adjusted FIFO operating profit, providing once again the strength of our financial model in a variety of operating environments.  \n Our teams are focused on delivering a great customer experience with 0 compromise. Rising inflation, as consumers rethinking their shopping and eating habits, while customers continue to cook more, we are seeing different shopping behaviors based on how individual customers are experiencing the current inflationary environment.  \n Many customers continue to shop premium products throughout the store, including Private Selection, Murray's Cheese and deluxe meal solutions. For other customers whose budget are more directly impacted by food and fuel inflation, they are actively looking for ways to save. We're doing everything we can to help this customer stretch their budgets.  \n I'd like to share more about the work we're doing for our customers and how our competitive moats uniquely position us to meet these challenging and changing customer needs.  \n First, we are leading with fresh. Our customers continue to prioritize fresh as the #1 determinant of where to shop. We are meeting their needs with operational efficiencies and new technologies that extend days of freshness and grow our selection of quality fresh products.  \n In the first quarter, we achieved 5.2% identical sales growth in our fresh categories. These gains were led by the expansion of our End-to-End Fresh Produce program, which elevates standards and improves our ability to maintain freshness throughout the supply chain.  \n We certified 355 stores this quarter, and the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We also continue to increase our use of forecasting and analytical tools, specifically leveraging 84.51\u00b0 to improve our ability to maintain fresh products in stock, both in store and online.  \n Our recent floral results are a great example of how we are leading with fresh. As the nation's largest florist, the first quarter was our time to shine for holiday celebrations and our floral team stepped up, achieving record sales. In fact, we set an overall single-day floral sales record on Valentine's Day and a Mother's Day sales record with strong double-digit growth.  \n Second is Our Brands. During the quarter, we saw tremendous growth in Our Brands, which had identical sales of 6.3% and outpaced all national brands. With 92% of households purchasing at least one of these products, we launched 239 new and innovative products during the quarter, reflecting many of the top food trend predictions we made at the beginning of the year. All of our new products continue to be tested and validated to ensure that they are as good or better than the comparable national brand. We continue to invest heavily in the quality of Our Brands, which preserves our strong price position and drives higher profitability.  \n Next area is personalization. Our data science platform provides unique insights that creates personalized customer experiences. In this dynamic environment where customer behaviors are changing rapidly, we use our data and insights to be nimble and react quickly to ever-changing needs. Our broad-based data science approach helps us determine how to best implement price, promotion and display.  \n We are focused on delivering incredible value to our customers through relevant personalized offers and fuel rewards. Our loyal customers are using our fuel rewards program now more than ever and, in fact, more than 600,000 incremental households engaged for the first time this quarter.  \n Finally, our seamless ecosystem continues to deliver fresh products to our customers anytime, anywhere and with 0 compromise.  \n During the first quarter, more customers returned to in-store shopping. And as a result, we made strides to enhance that experience while introducing new tools that help our associates better serve customers. In pickup, we unveiled new technology that improved wait times 20% and expanded capacity based on customer needs. In delivery, we continue to introduce key initiatives that expand our reach and shorten delivery times. We strive to provide more customers access to high-quality, affordable food regardless of whether they have a physical store in their community.  \n During the quarter, we opened 2 new customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado's automated Smart Platform, one in Dallas, Texas and one in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, bringing our total CFC count to 5.  We also opened 3 new spoke locations for a total of 6 spokes.  \n As we head into summer, our end-to-end cold solutions, including the custom-built refrigerated van, will ensure customers get the freshest product delivered directly to their doorstep.  \n Finally, our Boost membership is delivering promising results. Our one-of-a-kind membership program offers incredible value where customers can get unlimited free delivery on orders of $35 or more, double the fuel points on every dollar spent at Kroger and other exclusive member benefits.  \n We are encouraged by the number of new members in the 4 current pilot divisions. Importantly, delivery sales increased significantly compared to non-Boost divisions and delivery retention improved approximately 600 basis points.  \n Because of this early success, we are proud to announce today that Kroger Boost is launching nationwide beginning in the next few weeks. This next-generation loyalty program is deepening our relationships with customers as they continue to look for value and convenience.  \n Turning to supply chain. Our 2022 business plan anticipated ongoing supply chain challenges. By planning ahead and focusing on staffing, technology and process efficiencies, we manage our costs effectively. By owning and operating a portion of our fleet, we better control and manage transportation costs  despite diesel fuel cost headwinds. \n We were also proactive about forward buying and securing capacity for goods, resulting in better vendor rates. Through our supplier relationships, we saw sequential improvement in product availability. We are well positioned to adapt to the evolving environment, and we are cautiously optimistic in a broader supply chain recovery throughout the year.  \n We also continue to invest in our associates and an associate experience that facilitates an amazing customer experience. We firmly believe that exceptional financial and operating performance connects directly to the ways we support and invest in our associates.  \n During the quarter, we took numerous steps to meet our associates' needs while they delivered for our customers. We continue to invest in associate wages and we expect hourly wages to grow throughout the year.  \n We launched new initiatives to simplify day-to-day work, including the modernized scheduling tool, MyTime. We took steps to improve communication across all of our teams and bring meaningful training to all of our associates no matter where they work. One example of this commitment is the addition of Microsoft Teams Rooms across most of our store locations. This technology improvement will facilitate deeper connections and improve the associate experiences.  \n As an employer of choice, more people are applying to work for Kroger and more associates are choosing to stay with us. While we still have work to do, we experienced a meaningful improvement in both hiring and retention in the months after the Omicron surge. We are also seeing more boomerangs. These are associates who left to work elsewhere and ultimately came back to us. Kroger's strong culture invites associates to come for a job and discover a career. And we're glad that so many value and appreciate our work environment, our culture and the people they work with every day.  \n Our winning culture is rooted in living our purpose to feed the human spirit. During the past last year, our teams took significant steps to support our customers and communities through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan. We introduced a new Kroger and USO co-branded mobile unit to nourish active duty military service members and their families at military bases and USO centers across the country as well as provide community disaster relief. The first of 4 units hit the road in May.  \n In summary, we're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2022. We are widening our competitive moats, creating a shopping experience with 0 compromise, investing where it matters most to our customers and associates and strengthening our purpose in large and small ways every day. When we do all of this well, our teams, our customers and our shareholders all win.  \n Now I'd like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our first quarter results. Gary? Thanks, Gary. I would like to once again acknowledge and thank our outstanding associates. Their hard work and dedication fuel our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy and our obsession for our customers. We continue finding new ways to help customers stretch their dollars through everyday prices, data-driven promotions, personalized experiences, trusted Our Brand products and a seamless e-commerce platform. We believe this relentless focus on delivering for customers will help us maintain robust sales and drive growth.  \n Moving ahead, we remain confident that we have the right strategy to deliver value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.  \n Now we'll turn to your questions. Thanks, Robby, and good morning. If you look at -- in terms of traffic, the 2 areas that we felt really good about is if you look at the number of loyal shoppers we have and our household count, both improved. Now a typical basket size for a customer coming in continues to decline. Part of that is just driven because of the economic environment some customers are having.  \n If you look at identicals during the quarter, toward the end of the quarter, they finished a little stronger than where we were during the quarter, and that's continued so far early in the second quarter. Obviously, we're extremely early in the quarter.  \n Obviously, we do have a reasonable-sized general merchandise business that affect it as well. And the comment that I made in the prepared comments, if you look at our fresh departments, they were up over 5%.  \n So overall, we think the customers are doing a lot of work on balancing their total budget, and we continue to balance it as well with promotions. And then customers are aggressively starting to buy our brands and what they're finding is the quality of that product, and there's no compromise with that versus some of the other products. And if you look at our price spreads, we check pricing, obviously, every week. We look at pricing spreads for different types of customers. And those spreads continue to be where they've been or improving slightly has been the case over the last couple of years.  \n I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? Yes. I love the question, John. And as you know, we're super proud of our brands and super proud of Private Selection, the banner brand and Simple Truth and then Home Chef is our most recent owned brand. \n The -- that growth has been strong across all components. The only exception of that is Simple Truth was a little soft earlier in the quarter because we did have supply issues with one of the chicken suppliers. But other than that, growth is nice as well. \n As you know, what we've always found is over time, our brands gain share, and that's been true for over 25 years. And when the economy is tight, our brands always gain share. And then once the economy is good, we may lose a little or maintain, but that's been the case all throughout. Because what customers find is once they try it, they love it. \n We -- if you look at our leadership team, our -- we've gone and really upgraded our leadership team in terms of our focus on our brands. And for us, it really is -- we look at it the same as a national brand. Our customers do. And as I mentioned, over 90% of our customers include it in their basket. So feel really good. \n Your second part of your question about the national brand change. I think there's still a lot of capacity constraints among some of the national brands. So I would expect if it's a national brand with capacity, you'll see a typical trend where they get more aggressive in promoting as their tonnage goes down. But if they're supply constrained, I would be surprised. And part of that is just because all of us are exiting COVID at a level of volume higher than what we had going in, which has put different people at different points on supply constraints. Yes. We do -- the excess warehouse space that we took on as part of COVID, a lot of that space, we've continued to keep. And I would say we're using that space to be able to get product when we can get it. So I think a lot of the CPGs are using it to level out production. So when they have excess production, we're taking that. And it, in essence, becomes forward buy, but I don't think it will be as big as it's been in past situations. Yes. Well, it's a good question. And obviously, we always spend a lot of time focused on it. \n Your first comment, we are seeing the competitive environment pretty similar to what it's been. As you know, our go-to-market strategy really is Leading With Fresh. And what we find is it's the most important reason why somebody decides where to shop. And our teams are really working hard to take our fresh experience to the next level, and our customers are telling us they appreciate what they're doing and they're seeing that improvement. \n So when you look at it, we think price is just one component. We're going to make sure that we always maintain a reasonable spread in the things that we're good at with our rewards program, our fuel rewards and our fresh go-to-market strategy. Those things matter, and that's where we're going to win in the marketplace. And we expect that to continue to be important in every imaginable environment going forward. \n So to me, it's one of those things where it's important, we continually check. But we always think it's important to remember it's the total customer experience that we're focused on rather than price alone. The other thing I think it's always important to remember is we always look at gross margin in light of our OG&A cost as well. And obviously, our teams did an incredible job of managing OG&A costs. And we always will invest some of those OG&A savings in trying to extend the customer's budget, especially in an environment like this where it's important. And I think some of those reasons are the reasons why our customer counts have improved as well. If you look at grocery market share for the -- overall, it's pretty much close to where we thought it would be. We would expect continued improvement throughout the year, which was reflected in the original guidance. \n Your comment on general merchandise is correct. Our general -- if you look at our identicals in total, without general merchandise, it would be pretty similar to where the fresh IDs were. \n And the general merchandise, obviously, households are starting to change their behavior on shopping and it shows up there. And obviously, some of the savings and things that customers had from not being able to spend money on service as well is showing up there. \n So we are making progress on market share overall and would expect to continue to make marked improvements as we go along in the year. Yes. If you look on the basket size, that's driven by units per basket. And what we're finding is customers are coming in more frequently before but they're not buying as many items on each shop. And that's what we're seeing. \n We're also seeing customers, especially customers that aren't as sensitive to their budget, upscaling with or buying bigger packs, especially earlier in the month when -- depending on when people were getting money. So we continue to see both of those dynamics. If you look at the fresh departments, the trends there would be better than the overall. \n The -- if you look at overall units, we -- for most of the CPG partners, we would be tracking pretty similar to where their unit changes are overall in the marketplace in -- if you look at our top 25. \n I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? And I know you're pulling up some... Yes. I always think it's important to look at CPI and PPI together. And it's also the reason why we shared a little bit more details about Our Brands than normal because you have -- customers are doing their own behavior in terms of changing the way they shop. \n So if you think about, in some cases, a national brand item may cost $3 and Our Brand might be $1 or $2. So that would show up and would cause our inflation rate not to be as high as what's in the marketplace. \n I also think it's important to remind people that on -- when you look at Our Brands overall, our gross margin's about 600 basis points better than the national brand. And if you look at profit per item, it's similar or, in many cases, actually higher. \n So to me, I would look at those numbers as general directional things but not specifics to be able to compare directly just because customers' behavior is changing.  And if you look at like in pork, as an example, customers aggressively moved to pork during the quarter. And some of that movement was at the expense of people not buying as much beef because it's a great value for the money, as an example. \n So you have -- within all the data, you have a lot of customer behavior changes. But I think it's helpful directionally, but not exactly. If you look, all of us, our quarters end at a little different time. So it's always difficult to be exactly comparison. And I know some of the competitors don't break out specific by category. And I know for us, obviously, general merchandise is a bigger part of our business than some of our traditional competitors, not as much as some of the big-box competitors. \n If you look at during the quarter, our trends improved as we went along during the quarter. As Gary mentioned, our household count went up, increased. Our loyal household count went up. And our visits in total also increased. And our trends improved as well. So those are the things that give us confidence in terms of the things that we're doing and the direction we're headed is continuing to move in the right direction. It's an ongoing dialogue. And obviously, overall, we try to make sure that we have a partnership relationship. It's also one of the values in having Our Brands so it's such a strong component. So we understand true cost increases versus somebody just wanting to raise margins. \n In many cases, with the CPG partners, we're identifying areas where we can work together to take costs out so that we can reduce it. And like on backhauls is an area that we're making great progress on by using technology, both of our technologies and databases, to understand how to change. \n I would say that we're going to always push back on any type of cost increase that's not justified. And we're going to also try to work together to figure out a way to reduce our combined costs whenever we can. \n I think it's a difficult answer to say how are we doing versus competition or competitors. I'm super proud of our procurement team. As Gary mentioned earlier, one of the big component on the cost saves is renegotiating both things not for resell and resell [ both ]. So we feel good about where we are, but it's an ongoing dialogue. And obviously, it's a little more difficult dialogue when you have such high inflation. Yes. If you look at the test regions, it would positively affect our identicals. And the thing that's most important to us is it causes that customer to be stickier to our overall ecosystem, not just on delivery. So -- and our strategy is that if a customer thinks food, we want them to think Kroger. So we feel good about where we are and it's continued in the right direction. Yes. Thanks, Chuck. If you look at -- pickup would be the area where we would have the biggest decline. And what -- as I mentioned, what we're finding is that customer, as they get comfortable, they move back into stores. And the retention rate is better than the overall retention rate. \n If you look at the sheds, the NPS scores continue to be outstanding. The retention rate and repeat purchase rate on the sheds is very strong. And they're continuing to move in the right direction. \n And if you look toward the end of the quarter in the recent few weeks, our performance on year-on-year for online has actually turned to positive. \n So the first quarter was pretty similar to where we thought it would be because we were cycling some strong numbers early in the quarter, and the trend has moved back into the positive neighborhood. So thanks, Chuck. Thank you for -- to everyone for joining us today. I am incredibly proud of the way we are beginning in 2022, with a continued focus on our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy. \n As always, I'd like to share a few comments with our associates listening in. First, obviously, thank you. The past several years have been challenging and weighed on all of us differently. While each of us react in a unique way, no one should have to struggle alone. That's why we offer a variety of resources, from in-person and virtual counseling sessions through our well-being assistant, to tools to help leaders of others foster a supportive environment.

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger delivered another quarter of strong results as our team did an outstanding job executing our go-to-market strategy while navigating a dynamic operating environment. Our results again highlight the strength and resilience of Kroger's financial model, which allowed us to continue to invest in our associates, deliver fresh, affordable food for our customers and create value for our shareholders.  \n I'll now provide more detail on our results in the quarter. Led by our competitive moats, we achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 4.1%. Fresh categories and Our Brands identical sales both outpaced overall company results.  \n Adjusted EPS was $1.45, up 22% compared to the same quarter last year, driven by increased sales and exceptional cost management during the quarter.  \n Digital sales declined 6% in the first quarter, broadly in line with our expectations. We continue to ramp the digital growth initiatives shared at our Investor Day, including enhanced personalization capabilities, Boost membership, customer fulfillment centers and Kroger Delivery Now. As a result of these initiatives, we grew digitally engaged households during the quarter, and we would expect digital sales to accelerate as the year progresses.  \n Gross margin was 21.6% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 26 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily attributable to continued strategic price investments and higher supply chain costs, offset by sourcing benefits and the cycling of a write-down related to a donation of personal protective equipment inventory in the prior year.  \n Our team continues to do an excellent job managing higher product cost inflation. We are leveraging our data and sourcing expertise and working closely with our suppliers to help minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model. We are investing where it matters most to our customers and are using our proprietary data to deliver additional value through personalization.  \n Our Brands are also proving to be an important differentiator for our customers in this environment, providing an unmatched combination of great quality and great value.  \n We will continue to leverage these proven and unique capabilities to help our customers manage their grocery budgets more effectively and maintain a strong value proposition relative to our competitors as we believe inflation will remain front of mind for many of our customers for the remainder of 2022.  \n In recognition of current product cost inflation and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million compared to $37 million in the prior year. This increase represents a $0.06 headwind to EPS in the quarter versus 2021.  \n Our OG&A rate decreased 46 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We were successful in offsetting inflation headwinds in many parts of our business and continued investments in our associate wages by reducing costs in areas that do not impact the customer experience. As an example, this quarter, we introduced a new bakery forecasting tool, which is improving product freshness, reducing waste and, at the same time, simplifying the associate ordering process. We have a strong pipeline of process improvement initiatives and innovative technology-driven solutions that will lower digital fulfillment costs, increase store productivity and reduce waste and shrink.  \n For the fifth consecutive year, we remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings in 2022. The traffic and data generated by our supermarket business continue to create a strong flywheel effect for alternative profits. Led by retail media and Kroger Personal Finance, alternative profits are on track to contribute meaningful growth in 2022.  \n During the quarter, Kroger Precision Marketing added more than 100 new brand partners. We continue to enhance our market-leading capabilities and have entered into new agreements with 3 leading advertising management platforms, allowing our CPG partners to manage their on-site ad campaigns more effectively.  \n Fuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars, especially when fuel prices are high. We continue to deliver significant value through our loyalty program, which saves customers up to $1.25 per gallon. As Rodney shared earlier, more customers engaged with fuel rewards this quarter, and our gallons grew at a faster rate than the market.  \n The average retail price of fuel was $4 this quarter versus $2.79 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.42 compared to $0.35 in the same quarter last year.  \n Our associates continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and serving our customers. we introduced a number of new initiatives to support associates this quarter as well as continuing to invest in hourly wages. These investments are fully contemplated in our guidance and long-term financial model.  \n During the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW in Denver, Southern California, Houston, Little Rock, Memphis and Seattle, covering more than 67,000 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW in Las Vegas, Southern California for Ralphs pharmacies, Indianapolis, Roanoke, Chicago and Columbus.  \n Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.68 compared to 1.79 a year ago. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5.  \n Consistent with our financial strategy, we are investing in the business to drive sustainable future earnings growth and continue to expect capital expenditures of between $3.8 billion and $4 billion in 2022.  \n During quarter 1, we were disciplined in returning cash to shareholders. In total, Kroger returned $819 million via a combination of share repurchases and dividends.  \n We are operating from a position of financial strength and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy excess cash to accelerate our growth model and deliver sustainable total shareholder returns.  \n In closing, let me share additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. While there are a number of uncertainties in the macroeconomic and inflation outlook for the remainder of 2022, Kroger is laser-focused on executing the plans outlined at our Investor Day, and we believe our go-to-market strategy will serve us well in navigating the current environment.  \n Based on the strength of our quarter 1 results and sustained food-at-home trends, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 2.5% to 3.5%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $3.85 to $3.95, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7%.  \n Our updated guidance assumes inflation will remain at tightened levels for the remainder of the year, although we would expect the year-over-year rate to moderate in the second half of the year as we cycle higher inflation from quarter 3 and quarter 4 2021.  \n Due to this higher outlook for inflation, we now expect our LIFO full year charge will be in the range of $300 million compared to $197 million last year. As a reminder, while the actual LIFO charge is calculated at a point in time at the end of our fourth quarter, we recognize the projected charge evenly throughout the year.  \n Our guidance also assumes retail fuel profitability will be a headwind for the remainder of 2022 as we cycle higher CPG margins from 2021.  \n Our full year projected tax rate has been lowered from 23% to 22%, primarily due to higher-than-expected tax deductions related to employee stock option exercises.  \n Overall, we are extremely pleased with our start to the year, which provides another proof point of the strength of our financial model. And looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained earnings growth and total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time.  \n And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. I think you covered it well, Rodney. The only other point you mentioned around total households and loyal households growing, we also saw visits improving during the quarter as well, Robby, which was -- we were really pleased with that trend as well. Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, I'll cover that, and Rodney can add any additional color he'd like to. \n Generally, our gross margin rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter. As you heard us share, we had 2 major investments during the quarter, which was investing in value for the customer and also the supply chain headwinds that we -- as Rodney mentioned in his prepared comments, we fully expected during the year. \n Overall, we feel like we were right in line with what we expect it to be. I know we called out in our comments around the PPE inventory write-off, that really wasn't material enough to sort of be something that I think investors should be thinking about is going to be a factor in our expectations for the rest of the year. I think we shared in our original guidance for the year that we believe gross margin would be a headwind during the year as we made the investments in price and supply chain. The first quarter played out largely as we expected. \n We don't call out all the puts and takes in the quarter. And things like COVID vaccines would have been a tailwind last year, that wouldn't have been a tailwind this year. \n So I think there's a lot of extra moving parts in there. And what we try and do is call out the pieces that we've communicated previously so we're consistent and also give you a flavor for the major moving parts. But overall, we felt the quarter was very much in line with strategy, and we wouldn't be pointing to a change in that for the rest of the year. \n I'll maybe just add one piece of additional color because I know it's kind of something I've seen as a sort of question floating around before the call started was, certainly, the gross margin outlook hasn't changed. That's not a factor in how we think our guidance looks for the rest of the year. We're very confident with how we think about the outlook for the rest of the year. \n I think that some of the factors to bear in mind when you think about the second half, I mentioned it in my prepared comments, but LIFO for the year is going to be about $150 million higher than budget and about $100 million higher than prior year spread across the 4 quarters. We do expect fuel margins will be a headwind for the rest of the year and directionally think of that as maybe a $50 million or so headwind as well. \n So I think about it more of the underlying trends that we shared during the quarter is something that we feel is right on track with our plan. But there are some unique factors that will influence the second half of the year. And from our perspective, those are generally going to be things that you won't have to cycle in 2023, but there are obviously headwinds in the rest of this year in terms of our overall financial outlook. Sure. Thanks, Karen. Yes, I think the first part of the question would be, as I mentioned it a moment ago, around we look at the guidance for the rest of the year. Our overall outlook for inflation is that we do expect inflation is going to be higher for the rest of the year than we originally expected when we sort of entered 2022 and provided our original guidance. \n Having said that, it's important, I think, to remember that we don't have a perfect crystal ball, of course, like all of us are trying to figure out there are multiple scenarios that could play out. I think our central scenario though is that we think inflation will remain higher. But as we cycle about a 4% increase in inflation in the second half of last year compared to the first half of last year, absolute annual inflation, we may well actually start to see a more moderated number in the second half of the year. So we're currently assuming inflation in the second half as a headline rate maybe a couple of percentage points or so lower than the first half of the year. \n So we're actually -- if you think about our sales guidance, we are assuming that we see some momentum in our units because of the way we're thinking about inflation. Now of course, that outcome could be different and that will impact the outcome of the results that we report, but our overall assumption is based on that kind of high-level view, which we think takes into account all the different data points that we've been able to look at both internally and externally. \n And then from an operating profit perspective, as I mentioned a few moments ago, from really the way we think about the rest of the year, our overall EPS guidance, if you kind of look at the midpoint of our new range for the rest of the year, it would be flat to slightly down. I think the really key messages in that would be think about the, as I mentioned a moment ago, the LIFO charge will be having a major impact on that, both versus budget and versus prior year. And as I mentioned, whereas fuel would have been a tailwind in the first quarter, it will actually be a headwind for the rest of the year. So we think of the sort of supermarket business as being robust and relatively on track in terms of what we would have expected and continuing to build momentum. It's really around those other factors that are driving the lack of sort of carryforward of the momentum on year-over-year growth in the first quarter when you look at that relative to the rest of the year. Vaccine headwind would have been in the first quarter probably a factor, and then it would also be a factor in Q2 and Q3. But again, I wouldn't think of that as being a major headwind on what -- so that was probably a bigger factor in Q1 as any quarter. So I wouldn't think of the gross margin performance that we saw in the first quarter of the year as being dramatically different expectation in the remaining quarters based on the impact of vaccine and other factors. Sure. Yes. Just briefly, I would say, on the EPS side of things, I mentioned a moment ago, Rupesh, that I think if you look at the guidance for the back -- the last 3 quarters of the year, it would sort of predominantly be around the sort of flat to slightly down. I would think of that, if you look at the cadence last year, it would be relatively consistent if you think about the next 3 quarters. So I wouldn't call out any dramatic year-over-year variance to that overall. \n And then I think on a sales perspective, as we mentioned, we would expect the first half to be a little bit better than the second half in terms of sales. That's predicated on this belief though that inflation continues at heightened levels. But on a year-over-year basis, the back half would be potentially a few basis points lower because we're cycling 4% higher inflation in the second half of last year than the first half of last year. Yes. Well, I think just to clarify maybe the comment we made, the total basket size is actually up. It's the number of units in the basket that are down. So if we look at our overall metrics, households are up, loyal households are up, visits have turned positive, basket size is up. But the number of items in the basket, as Rodney mentioned, is the item that I think customers are adapting behavior as they start to manage the inflationary environment. And that's obviously a focus area for us to use data personalization and different tools around rewards to really aim to continue to drive that up. \n And as I mentioned, if you look at our second half guidance as we expect in our current assumption, inflation would be, on a year-over-year basis, maybe not as quite as high even though remaining at sustained levels, then our guidance reflects the expectation that we continue to make progress on that front. Yes. I wouldn't want to get into specific guidance because of the comment that Rodney mentioned around we do try and manage the business dynamically. I think what I was really saying, Ed, was it was specific to the current year. I'm really saying that when you think about Q1, I think there was some concern that the PPE write-down was somehow need to be reversed out and that would be the trend that we're seeing in terms of gross margin rate. So I think the guidance that we shared at the beginning of the year was we expected gross margin to be a headwind. We didn't expect the volatility to be as significant as we've seen in the past. And as I mentioned, the PPE is really one of a number of puts and takes. But because we called it out last year in the first quarter, we didn't want to not clearly mention it again in the current quarter, but I wouldn't see it as a major factor. And so it was related to Q1 was the -- that's the kind of directional shape of gross margin, which is, I think, consistent with what we shared when we gave our guidance for the year. Yes. The $1 billion of savings would certainly be sort of an ongoing flow of initiatives. So certainly think about it as being consistently sort of building from -- so we've got a certain number of benefits from last year that flow through, and then we're introducing new initiatives this year. So because we're on this 5-year journey, $1 billion of savings, it's very much a continual flow of new initiatives that are being implemented in the business to drive those efficiencies and savings. \n So I'd certainly think of it in general terms as being fairly consistently throughout the year. Now of course, there are a number of puts and takes in lines and we continue to invest in average hourly rates. I think we mentioned in the first quarter, there was a benefit from lower pension contributions during the first quarter. So I wouldn't think of the OG&A rate improvement that we saw in Q1 as being typical for the year. But we do expect to continue to see OG&A rate in the year being an improvement and a tailwind for the year. Yes. The only other thing maybe I would add, Rodney, is that the comments we made, Michael, about digital growth and the expectation that with the investments we're making in customer fulfillment centers, the announcement -- the exciting announcement that Rodney shared this morning around Boost membership launching across the whole of the company, we feel that the momentum that we're seeing starting to build in digital will also be an important component of that growth in the future as well. Thanks, Michael. Yes, I think briefly, we see that as an opportunity actually for Kroger because what we tend to see in those more economically challenged times is that the customer that's less stressed, as you described them, actually views Kroger as a high-quality place to get more value compared to maybe shopping a larger number of stores, and we even see it with some of our own brand performance. Rodney mentioned the strong value and ingredients for cooking at home, but we also saw strength during the quarter in Private Selection and Meal Solutions. So we see that as an opportunity for us to really connect with that customer as they start to maybe determine the best place to shop for quality and value combined. Chuck, yes, I think there's a couple of different factors just briefly in there. Overall, we've been on a plan for a number of years to continue to optimize working capital. So I wouldn't say it's a dramatic change in strategy. We're very focused on continuing to drive improvements there and have seen good tailwinds in our cash flow because of that. \n This quarter, we would have seen an increase in inventory. Part of that would be to do with sort of starting to get back towards pre-COVID levels as the in-stock and supply chain improves. Nothing that would be concerning to us from a sell-through perspective, but we do think it's important to make sure we continue to improve the supply chain. And of course, inflation would have also impacted that number as well, but nothing out of the ordinary."

I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Robert Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRobert Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger\u2019s third quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today\u2019s discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.\nRodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our third quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the third quarter and walk through updates to our full year guidance. And finally, I will close with some comments on our pending merger with Albertsons. Turning first to our performance, we delivered strong third quarter sales results led by our pharmacy and digital performance, which reflects the versatility of our model. Customer engagement remains strong. Our convenient, Seamless shopping experience, along with incredible customer value through low prices, personalized offers and great quality Our Brand products, drove growth in both total and loyal households. As we entered the last quarter of 2024, we are focused on providing the quality, Fresh and affordable products that make holiday celebrations special. Customer spending habits continue adjusting to current macroeconomic factors. As inflation normalizes, our premium and mainstream households are feeling more confident and are returning to their pre-pandemic shopping patterns more quickly. Mainstream households are the primary driver of our positive customer engagement trends. While overall consumer sentiment remains low, expectations are improving, which positions us well for the holidays and into next year. As we said, near-term, some customers are managing macroeconomic uncertainty. Spending from budget-conscious households remain under pressure, as the effects of multiyear inflation and higher interest rates have had a larger impact on these households. Therefore, we expect it will take longer for these households to fill the benefits of economic improvement. Kroger is delivering on its longstanding commitment to provide customers with the value they are seeking. We are helping customers save in multiple ways, including competitive shelf prices and loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and an expanded multi-tier Our Brands portfolio. Digital offers are an important way we deliver savings to customers and engagement continues to grow. With 5% more digital offer clips so far this year and that has led to 14% more savings for Kroger customers. We are always creating additional ways for our customers to save. This quarter, we celebrated and thanked our customers with a Customer Appreciation Week, offering new great deals, and to help our customers enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, we lowered the price of Thanksgiving meals for the third consecutive year, by creating a meal bundle that served a group of 10 people for less than $5 per person. We are focused on executing our go-to-market strategy to deliver a differentiated customer experience through our focus areas of Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and Seamless. We appreciate our associates\u2019 continued efforts to elevate the customer experience and bringing this strategy to life by improving on our key priorities of Full, Fresh & Friendly again this quarter. I would now like to cover how we are enhancing our go-to-market strategy. We are seeing long runways for growth in many areas of our strategy, starting with Fresh. Customers connect strongly to our Fresh for Everyone brand promise, which is a key differentiator for Kroger. Improvements across the supply chain as part of our end-to-end Fresh initiative are increasing days of freshness. For example, bagged salads now offer customers more than seven days of freshness. Customers are noticing and it has led to identical sales in produce of more than 3% this quarter. In addition, we constantly evaluate new ways to apply data and technology to provide an even better Fresh experience and deliver more days of freshness for our customers. One of the ways we are doing this is through recent implementation of RFID-embedded labels on bakery items. These labels provide us with greater insights into our Fresh inventory, resulting in consistently fresher items and higher in-stock levels. We have seen encouraging results, including higher sales, in locations and categories where we have piloted the RFID labels and we look forward to scaling this to more stores. Turning to Our Brands, I would like to step back and talk about the significant investments we have made in Our Brands and how those investments are delivering value to both customers and shareholders. For years, the grocery industry offered private label products with the primary goal of creating products at lower price points. Several years ago, we recognized an untapped opportunity for growth in these products and envisioned a future where our private label products would match or exceed the innovation, quality and recognition of national brands, which is why we coined the phrase, Our Brands. Guided by that vision, our teams built distinct and recognizable brands that our customers want and love, providing more value and meeting unique product needs that national brands cannot fill. Recently, we focused in on refining Our Brand architecture to optimize the portfolio and ensure each brand plays a unique role on the shelf. The successful addition of Smart Way, our new opening price point brand, played an important role in rounding out our multi-tiered portfolio and offering an attractive alternative to national brands at every price point. The next phase of the work involved refreshing designs and packaging, enhancing brand equity, and reinforcing quality and improving the shopability. For example, to reinforce our longstanding guarantee of quality and freshness, we are placing guarantees on labels across our Kroger branded products. Innovation remains a driving force for Our Brands\u2019 growth. We utilize our data and insights to understand customer trends and meet increasing demands by consistently introducing new items to our portfolio with a focus on growth areas, including free-from, organic, and multicultural. This innovation enables us to differentiate ourselves from both national brands and other private label brands, creating destination items that help build customer loyalty. Our manufacturing capabilities will continue to be an important advantage for Our Brands. With oversight over the quality and the supply, we can develop unique and differentiated products while keeping costs low, allowing us to pass the savings to customers while preserving our ability to grow margins, a true win-win for customers and Kroger. This quarter, Our Brands continue to deliver strong financial results, which Todd will cover in more detail. Next, to Personalization. Our Kroger Plus program provides our loyal customers access to savings and rewards that in turn drive traffic to our Seamless experience. As customers become more engaged, we gain deeper insights into customer trends while creating the data that enables us to grow Kroger Precision Marketing and deliver more effective promotions and relevant product recommendations. We are working to grow Boost, the next level of our loyalty program, through new benefits and this quarter we announced the addition of Disney+, Hulu or ESPN+ streaming benefits with Boost annual memberships. Turning to Seamless, digital sales grew 11%, driven by an increase in both households and traffic. Within digital, delivery sales grew at 18% and continues to outpace other channels. Boost is one of the important ways we are increasing e-commerce penetration, providing customers an affordable membership model for free delivery. Increasing e-commerce penetration is important to our model, as households who shop with us digitally and are in our stores are our most loyal customers and increase retail media monetization opportunities as well. As our digital business grows, particularly in our delivery network, it continues to have a larger impact on our financial results. Improving profitability is a key priority and becoming even more important to our financial model. Over nearly a decade, we made significant investments in our digital capabilities, building out our own properties, creating distribution channels in both pickup and delivery, investing in automation, enhancing Personalization and introducing an industry-leading retail media network. While each of these capabilities required significant investments, we now have a unique digital experience that our customers enjoy. Moving forward, we are committed to growing volumes, utilizing automation, and introducing new technology that will create efficiency gains while helping us narrow the profitability gap between online and in-store. Narrowing that gap will generate meaningful operating margin benefits and help drive shareholder value over the next several years. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we are building loyalty, increasing customer engagement and creating more growth opportunities, first with alternative profit businesses, which had another solid quarter. Kroger Precision Marketing continued to deliver the most significant growth from our alternative profit businesses. Next, in Health & Wellness, as the pharmacy industry continues to transform, Kroger has a unique opportunity to play a bigger role in helping patients live healthier lives while growing our share of the industry. We are excited about this area of the business and its performance. This quarter demonstrates we can grow this business profitably in a way that supports our customers to live healthier lives. Sales and profitability this quarter were well ahead of last year, led by growth in both GLP-1s and vaccines. Our strong growth in vaccines reflect patient trust in Kroger to vaccinate them and their families during the start of the cold and flu season, the peak quarter of the year for vaccinations. Our Health & Wellness teams did an excellent job this quarter in building awareness around our vaccine capabilities, growing share, and administrating significantly more vaccines this year versus a year ago. These helped offset the product mix pressures from GLP-1s. Our vaccine efforts are leading to new patient scripts, which is important as these customers are more likely to become loyal households and spend more across the store. We appreciate our associates for their continued efforts to elevate the customer experience by delivering on our key priorities of Full, Fresh & Friendly. Team consistency leads to a better customer experience and we are excited about another quarter of improvement in retention. Our focus on retention reflects a holistic strategy, including investments in wages and benefits, as well as enhancing the associate experience through training, technology and career development opportunities. With that, I will hand it over to Todd to take you through our third quarter financial results. Todd?\nTodd Foley: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger\u2019s third quarter results reflect the durability of our model with strong pharmacy results that helped offset lower fuel profitability as we cycled strong fuel results from a year ago. As we head into the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing the ranges on our identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. The strength of our model gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on this full year guidance. Before I walk through our third quarter financial results, I would like to start off by covering a couple of items from the quarter that affected our financial results. First, during the third quarter, we finalized the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business for $464 million. The sale reduced total company sales in the third quarter by approximately $340 million, compared to the same period last year, and annualized sales will be approximately $3 billion lower going forward. KSP was a low-margin business. As a result, the sale of the business increased both Kroger\u2019s gross margin and operating general and administrative costs as a rate of sales. It had no material effect on operating profit. Second, on a year-over-year basis, the combined hurricane season and port strike had approximately a 20-basis-point favorable impact on sales as customers stocked up in anticipation of these events. These events had an unfavorable impact on OG&A. Together, this did not have a material impact on total operating profit. I\u2019ll now take you through our third quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 2.3%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, identical sales without fuel were led by strong pharmacy and digital sales. We\u2019re also encouraged by the continuation of positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households. Our Brands had a strong quarter, with sales outpacing national brands again this quarter, led by mid-single-digit growth in our most premium brand, Private Selection. Customers continue to demand premium products, but at the same time are looking for value. Our Private Selection brand is a perfect solution by offering our customers premium quality at an attractive price. These results demonstrate the breadth of Our Brands portfolio and the ability to meet customers\u2019 needs for quality and value. Digital sales delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, led by 18% growth in delivery solutions, driven by our customer fulfillment centers. The CFCs are offering customers a superior digital experience with excellent in-stocks, fresh items and a white-glove on-time delivery. CFC growth was driven by a significant increase in households and trips, as well as an increase in basket size. Our third quarter identical sales without fuel results were affected by the Boar\u2019s Head recalls that began in the second quarter. We acted quickly, with the safety of our customers in mind, as soon as we became aware of the situation. Boar\u2019s Head is a strategic supplier with brand-loyal customers that are an important driver of our deli sales. As a result, some customers have temporarily migrated away from the category. It will take some time for those customers to resume their prior purchasing behavior and we expect this to remain a headwind to sales in the near term. The unfavorable sales effect from Boar\u2019s Head this quarter was largely offset by the favorable sales impact from the hurricane and port strike. Turning to margins, gross margin was 22.9% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 51 basis points compared to last year and was ahead of expectations. The increase in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, Our Brands performance and lower strength, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. The result reflected Kroger\u2019s ability to improve margin while being competitive on price and helping customers manage their budgets. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 22 basis points, driven by the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and increased incentive plan costs, partially offset by the continued execution of cost savings initiatives. Excluding the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, fuel and adjustment items, our OG&A rate to sales would have been nearly flat year-over-year, demonstrating that our model can leverage expenses when we achieve our long-term ID sales without fuel goal of 2% to 4%. This is made possible by a relentless focus on productivity and cost savings initiatives, which remain an essential part of our model. These initiatives are focused on simplification and utilizing technology to enhance the associate experience without impacting the customer experience. This quarter, we launched a new, internally developed, generative AI-powered sell-through tool, which helps us better manage inventory in both Fresh and center store departments through real-time insights tracking sales and shipments. This enables our teams to increase freshness on shelves and prioritize sell-through, optimizing both sales and margins. Looking ahead, we plan to further enhance the AI capabilities on this platform by extending into improved forecasting and end-to-end inventory management. During the third quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $4 million, compared to a charge of $29 million for the same period last year, due to lower expected year-over-year inflation. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.02 billion and adjusted EPS was $0.98 per diluted share, an increase of 3% compared to last year. Fuel is an important part of our strategy. Fuel rewards, through our Kroger Plus program, help build customer loyalty. Fuel sales were significantly lower this quarter compared to last year, attributable to a lower average retail price per gallon. Fuel profitability was also meaningfully behind a year ago, as a result of fewer gallons sold and lower cents per gallon margin. I wanted to provide a brief update on inflation, as it remains a topic of interest for many investors. Inflation was down slightly in the third quarter, compared with the second quarter, but remains around 1%. We expect inflation to remain consistent in the fourth quarter. I would now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for Dillon\u2019s Columbia, Missouri clerks, Central Division, Ottawa and Streeter clerks, Northern Illinois meat clerks, Fred Meyer Portland retail stores and the Foods Co. contract in Northern California, all covering nearly 13,000 associates. We respect associates\u2019 right to collectively bargain. We\u2019re also communicating to local unions that coming to the table with proposals that do not balance investing in associates with keeping groceries affordable for our customers and supporting a growing and profitable business model are untenable. These proposals stand in the way of operating our business in a way that ensures job security and advancement opportunities for associates. Turning to cash flow, Kroger continues to generate strong adjusted free cash flow through consistent operating results. Free cash flow generation is an important part of our model and is enabling us to invest in our business for growth. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger\u2019s net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.21, compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides us flexibility to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for our shareholders. We\u2019re committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time subject to board approval, and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. I would now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. After delivering solid third quarter results, we\u2019re narrowing the ranges of identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. Additionally, we have updated our guidance for adjusted effective tax rate and expect it to be 22.5%. We now expect identical sales without fuel for the year to be in the range of 1.2% to 1.5%. With quarter-to-date trends signaling, we will be near the midpoint of this range. Identical sales without fuel results year-to-date have largely been in line with our expectations, with Q3 being slightly ahead of expectations due to favorable effects from the hurricanes, the port strike and strong vaccine growth during the peak season for immunizations. Our expectations for fourth quarter identical sales without fuel are consistent with our forecast at the beginning of the year. We expect Q4 identical sales to remain strong, but sequentially lower than third quarter, partially due to the cycling of weather benefits from the fourth quarter of 2023 that are not built into our current forecast for Q4 2024. We now expect adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. Looking to next year, we are in the process of finalizing our 2025 business plan, while we still have many unknowns, we do expect Kroger to deliver FIFO operating profit growth on a standalone basis. During our fourth quarter earnings call, we plan to share our full year 2025 outlook in more detail. In closing, we are happy to deliver another quarter of strong results, which reflect the resilience of our value creation model. While macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, our model has multiple levers which enable us to navigate any environment, including grocery, Health & Wellness, fuel and alternative profit businesses. This gives us flexibility in the ways we create shareholder value and confidence in our ability to generate attractive and sustainable returns for shareholders. I will now turn the call back to Rodney.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks, Todd. Before I open it up to Q&A, I\u2019d like to speak briefly about our pending merger with Albertsons. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our associates and their incredible commitment. It has been a long journey and our associates have done an excellent job serving customers and running the day-to-day operations of our business while also preparing for the merger. I would like to extend a special thanks to those who supported the litigation in federal and state courts, both the associates who testified and the teams who prepared a compelling case about the meaningful and measurable benefits of the merger. Our teams are ready to ensure a Seamless transition for our customers and associates from day one. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both Kroger and Albertsons organizations, and we look forward to combining these strengths to provide customers with an even better experience. As we await the court rulings and the regulatory challenges to the merger, we remain confident in the facts and the strengths of our position. The retail industry continues to be more competitive and we know how our customers shop. Every day they are making decisions on where to eat and where to buy their groceries. They shop at a wide range of competitors, from Costco to Amazon to Dollar Stores, and they eat at restaurants. They shop digitally and brick-and-mortar. And as I\u2019ve said before, we remain committed to closing the merger because it will provide meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, for associates and for communities across the country, and we look forward to bringing these commitments to life. Regardless of the outcome of the trials, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and we are optimistic about our future. Our business is more diverse than ever and our value creation model provides us with multiple ways to drive sustainable growth. Our strong free cash flow and strengthened balance sheet provides us with the ability to invest in our business and enhance shareholder value. With that, Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are still in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning, Rodney, Todd. My question is on the P&L for 2024. If you take out the extra week lap and then you pull out some of the merger-related costs, the big ones, it looks like the core business is growing pretty nicely on EBIT and really nicely, potentially mid-single, even high single-digit percentage, and that\u2019s despite lower fuel profitability and the environment\u2019s been pretty tough. So first, is that a fair characterization and is it mixing the way you would have thought between the core business and the alternative? Thanks.\nTodd Foley: Great question, Simeon. Thanks for that and I think that\u2019s a fair read on how you\u2019ve described it. We were obviously very happy with the results that we\u2019ve seen coming from not only the core business but inclusive of pharmacy, particularly pleased with the results we saw in pharmacy, you heard Rodney talk about today. So despite that lever in fuel giving us a headwind this quarter, we were pleased with the core growth coming from the core business and see that continuing. The mix relative to alternative and core business, I think the growth expectations that we have around the alternative profit business are relatively consistent to what we expected to see and so I think that those continue to be as balanced as we expected going into the quarter.\nRodney McMullen: And longer term, as everyone knows, the alternative business -- profit businesses will continue to see a great opportunity and the margins on that business is meaningfully higher than the supermarket business, and the whole flywheel between our brick-and-mortar business and our Seamless business pickup and delivery is the engine behind driving that continuation there, which we\u2019re very excited about.\nTodd Foley: That\u2019s a great call, Rodney. We saw the digital growth again at low double-digit growth, which is an important part of the growth that you talked about, Simeon. And that, again, when you talk about mix in our business and our omnichannel, that low double-digit growth is right on what we expected and helps drive both the core business and the alternative profit as Rodney described.\nSimeon Gutman: And the one follow-up, this is more towards a comment Rodney made. All year, we talked about the mainstream, the premium and the lower end. It felt like there may have been an inflection whereas the mainstream has been resilient and the premium has been healthy. I thought your comments today on mainstream inflected a little more positively. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s reading too much in. Lower income sounds about the same. Curious if that\u2019s fair.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah. The mainstream customers certainly performed, connected with us better in the third quarter than the second quarter. How much of that is driven because of things we did and how much they\u2019re just feeling better, we don\u2019t know. Now they\u2019re telling us they feel better. And certainly customers that are on a budget continue to be under a lot of strain and the accumulation of inflation and other aspects and higher interest rates continue to affect them more. And I think the other thing that\u2019s always important to remember is, that customer in many cases are starting out in careers and things and they don\u2019t have as many physical assets on a house or a little bit of savings and those things, and those -- inflation obviously affects that person a little harder than others. Thanks, Simeon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So just going back to your guidance, so you did narrow the operating profit ratio to the lower end of the range for the full year. So just curious what\u2019s driving that.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah. Todd, I\u2019ll let you start.\nTodd Foley: Yeah. Well, with one quarter left, Rupesh, we wanted to try to narrow the range because there should be less variability in our expectations. When you look at the sales part of the guidance down at 1.2% to 1.5%, I think, that\u2019s pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve been thinking for the year. The midpoint on that range is a tick higher than I think what we had been thinking before. And frankly, when you look at where we expect to be in Q4, I think that\u2019s right on how we\u2019ve been thinking about it all year relative to all of that. Q3 actually is the one that was really strong and we talked about -- Rodney talked about the pharmacy and the digital growth there, particularly in the vaccine space. We were really pleased. We\u2019ve been working hard to grow our vaccine business and we saw that throughout the quarters early in this year, but with Q3 being that key vaccine, the Super Bowl season for vaccines, we were really pleased to see that that growth continue and that it paid off in that point in time. So that\u2019s where we saw Q3 being really strong and that Q4 guidance being really what we expected. When you look at it on the EPS side of our guidance through past again, narrow the range there. We took a nickel off the top side and the bottom side and really that midpoint of the range is pretty consistent with where we\u2019ve been thinking about it for the year. As we think about that range and some of the key factors for that range in the fourth quarter, a couple of key things that we\u2019re keeping an eye on. One is weather. We alluded to it in our prepared comments. There were several meaningful weather events a year ago that drove some benefits and we just don\u2019t forecast weather on a forward-looking basis. So if we see the number and magnitude of weather events in the fourth quarter this year, I think that would be something that could push us towards the higher end of that range. And then the other one is fuel. And certainly we -- fuel tends to be pretty volatile and we\u2019ve seen that this year and really we have fuel expectations to be pretty in line with where they were last year. And frankly, from a gallon trend and from a $0.01 per gallon trend in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re pretty consistent sequentially from where we\u2019ve been performing over the last few periods. So if we have variance in the fuel profitability, either positive or negative, I think that could lean us towards the top or the bottom end of that range, respectively.\nRodney McMullen: Todd said this, but I think it\u2019s important to just highlight it. If you look at the range for the year, fuel in the third quarter was a tougher quarter than what we expected it to be and that really relative to the top side. And the other thing that Todd mentioned, we don\u2019t budget weather because we just don\u2019t know. Obviously there\u2019s been some major storms, but those storms haven\u2019t been in places where we operate stores. So it really hasn\u2019t affected us so far. And generally that\u2019s a positive when we have weather because people eat at home as opposed to going to restaurants.\nRupesh Parikh: Okay. And then my very quick follow-up question, just on the Boost membership, you added the Disney perk as well. Just overall, are you guys happy with the signups you\u2019re seeing and the retention with that program?\nRodney McMullen: I would say we\u2019re very happy, but the thing that I guess I get more excited about is the potential, because it\u2019s an incredible value for customers and customers love it and we have a high renewal rate and a high NPS score. So our job is to continue to educate more customers on it. So I\u2019m really more excited about the opportunity going forward and the overall deeper connection with customers. So great question. Thanks, Rupesh.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Leah Jordan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nLeah Jordan: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question and thanks for the commentary on inflation this morning and how you\u2019re thinking about it in the fourth quarter. But as you plan with your vendors and seeing if you can add more color on how you\u2019re thinking about inflation into next year, what are you seeing across categories and hearing from those partners?\nRodney McMullen: Yeah. No. A great question. Maybe still a little early to think about next year, but you think about where we were this year, obviously, coming into the year, we were coming out of that crazy disinflation that we had a year ago. And inflation has played out more or less the way we expected. It\u2019s maybe a little bit less than what we expected, but it\u2019s been relatively stable at just under 1%. Maybe even saw, I think, a slight step back in Q3 relative to Q2, which as we said, we expect to see for next year. As we look to next year at this point, looking at both some of the macro and governmental studies, as well as conversations with vendors. Again, it\u2019s still early to tell. And we might see a slight expansion to inflation next year, but really don\u2019t expect to see anything meaningfully different or inconsistent with what we\u2019re kind of seeing right now with inflation.\nTodd Foley: We are continuing to see CPGs be a little more aggressive on trade dollars, and over time, that obviously affects inflation a little bit as well.\nLeah Jordan: Great. Thank you. And I just wanted to follow-up on some of your Fresh initiatives. I know you\u2019ve been working on improving days of freshness in produce for a while, so great to see some improvement there. But it seems like the RFID tags within bakery is new to me. Just wanted more color there, what degree of lift are you seeing when you add that to the category? How many of your stores have it today and how should we think about the rollout over time?\nRodney McMullen: Well, we are -- as I mentioned, we\u2019re testing it. We\u2019re happy with the initial result. The benefits are as much helping our associates be able to do their job a little bit easier. And it\u2019s too early -- it\u2019s early enough to be excited about the potential. It\u2019s too early to say this much we can budget in terms of what we would do. But the thing that we\u2019re excited about for our customers, it\u2019s helping us make sure we have fresher product for the customer and stay in stock better. And it\u2019s super exciting. We will look at other areas of the store to see what kind of opportunity it is. The cost per tag is still higher than we would like, so we still need to continue to work on focusing on the get the cost per tag down. But positive early results, really early in the process and excited about the potential. Thanks, Leah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the topic of next year. I appreciate it\u2019s too early for specifics and I\u2019m not asking for any numbers. But to Simeon\u2019s question, you agree that it\u2019s a fair read that the core underlying business is doing very well. I think those are the words, despite when you ex out the merger cost and the digital mix and fuel and so forth. And you talked a little bit about inflation being sort of steady and predictable and consistent in that low-single-digit range. Are there any other unusual tailwinds or headwinds that we should consider just directionally as we think about next year? Just trying to get a sense for what would kind of throw you off from having another reasonably good year. You did say that operating profit would be up, but you didn\u2019t kind of tell us how much and your longer term algo is 3% to 5%, of course?\nRodney McMullen: And it would be way too early to tell you specifics, and obviously, we\u2019re waiting for the ruling on the merger, which will affect guidance as well. The other thing that I guess from a positive standpoint that I\u2019m excited about, in the third quarter, we opened or expanded the most number of stores that we\u2019ve done. I think it\u2019s actually in a quarter in seven years. And as you know, last year we talked about it that we will open more stores this year than we have in several years and we would expect to continue to open more stores. And so far, the stores that we\u2019ve opened, we\u2019re happy with the way they\u2019re connecting with customers and we\u2019re happy in terms of the volumes they\u2019re creating and the early read on the profitability of the stores as well. So over time, we would hope that that would continue to be a tailwind, and obviously, on Seamless, we continue to see that as really critical to our five-year or 10-year future to be awesome there and we still have a lot of work to do to make where we\u2019re indifferent, whether somebody shops with us online or in-store and we\u2019ll continue to put a lot of effort there. In terms of headwind, Todd, I\u2019ll let you add anything that you can think of.\nTodd Foley: I can\u2019t think of anything unusual headwinds or tailwinds as we sit here today, frankly Ken. But going into next year, part of what has us optimistic and feeling good about the strength of our value creation model is a lot of the momentum we have in the things that are in our high growth areas today. We\u2019ve talked about a lot of them already. It\u2019s pharmacy, it\u2019s our digital business, it\u2019s our alternative profit. And we have good momentum in those spaces and are executing on those. And from a headwind standpoint, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the business. We\u2019re going to invest in price. You\u2019ve heard Rodney say it before. We assume every year is going to be more competitive than the last and that view hasn\u2019t changed. And so we\u2019ll continue to engage in customers, make sure we\u2019re delivering value to them by investing in price and investing in their shopping experience and we\u2019re committed to continue to invest in wages. So some of those are headwinds. They\u2019re just the parts of our model that is we deliver the value in our model through all their different value propositions. We\u2019re able to use that to invest in the business to keep the flywheel moving.\nKen Goldman: Okay. Thank you for that. And then speaking about price investments, Rodney, you mentioned that CPGs continue to be a little bit more aggressive on trade dollars. Your largest competitor are in food retail. We\u2019ll see if the judges agree that it\u2019s a competitor or not, but your largest competitor in food retail had more kind of commentary last week or this week about how they would like to see more of those price investments from key vendors. Rodney, your tone, since I\u2019ve known you has always been more sort of agnostic about that. If investors -- if your vendors don\u2019t invest with that, you\u2019ll be happy to sell customers more private label. I\u2019m just curious where you stand in terms of, are you content with the level of price investment or are you more just sort of agnostic and saying, look, whatever our vendors want, it\u2019ll play out either way beneficially for you.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah. I guess a little bit of both. The -- if you look at tonnage growth in CPGs, there\u2019s a lot of CPGs that cannot be satisfied with their tonnage growth. And I believe that trade dollars and being more aggressive on partnering with us to make sure the right customer gets access to those benefits is good long-term for the customer, a long-term benefit for both of us on tonnage. If they\u2019re not willing to do that, it really gets back to the comment that we talked about. Our Brands and Todd and I both mentioned it had a strong quarter, the profitability of Our Brands is several hundred basis points higher than national brand. And if the CPGs are willing to continue to give up share to Our Brands we\u2019re okay with that because what we find is once a customer tries Our Brand, the repeat rate of customers coming back is incredibly high because what they find is they have -- there\u2019s no compromise on quality and they have a great value for the money. So, at the end of the day, the customer wins when they buy Our Brands, but it really is we try to run a business where the customer decides what they want to buy as opposed to forcing them to buy something. Thanks Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nEd Kelly: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nEd Kelly: I\u2019m curious about the gross margin. You\u2019ve had a couple good quarters on the gross margin front. I think you admit this quarter was better than expected. How are you thinking about gross margin in Q4 and then, even like into, I don\u2019t know, you\u2019re not going to get next year, but sort of like the outlook for the gross margin. And I\u2019m talking like ex-Spec Pharma divestiture and maybe just talk about the puts and takes around that?\nTodd Foley: Yeah. No. Great question, Ed. And I think you hit on a key part of thinking about it excluding KSP. We talked about, it was a strong quarter in gross margin and about half of that year-over-year benefit was a result of the divestiture. But the other piece of it really came, we highlighted both of, Rodney, layers and what Rodney was just talking about, what was our growth in Our Brands, where we continue to have Our Brands sales growth outpacing national brands and that is always going to drive solid margin expansion. And so that\u2019s certainly what we saw again in the third quarter, very similar to what we saw in the second and then shrink had another nice quarter. So we\u2019ve got cautiously optimistic on the progress we\u2019re making there, but we are making progress on the shrink space that really helped us in the third. As we look to the fourth, I think, excluding KSP, I think overall we\u2019ll probably be slightly favorable in the fourth, reflecting KSP when you, when you pull that out, I think, we\u2019ll probably be relatively flat on that relative to some of the puts and takes. Again, if we over index in things like Our Brands and whatnot, but we may be a little bit favorable, but overall, I think we\u2019ll be, we\u2019ll be relatively consistent relatively flat year-over-year on the margins in Q4.\nRodney McMullen: I totally agree with everything Todd said. And Todd said the big pieces, I would also add a couple of smaller pieces that\u2019s helping on gross margin that should continue is if you look at our warehouse and transportation costs, continue to make some progress there and the customer continues to buy more value-added product and Fresh continues to grow as well. So those are things that help on mix and in addition to things that Todd talked about.\nEd Kelly: And just to Rodney, a quick follow-up, this one\u2019s for you. And you kind of hinted at it or talked about it, but Albertsons would be a transformational deal. How do you feel about Kroger\u2019s position, if the deal is rejected and do you need to hunt for something else more transformational or is it just simply more prudent to double down on what you have and, and reward shareholders for their patients with returning capital?\nRodney McMullen: Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. If you look at the balance sheet capacity that we have, there\u2019s probably no -- nothing else that would be transformational that would use the balance sheet capacity that we would have. So I don\u2019t know that we would be out there trying to find what\u2019s the next Albertsons. As you know and you just said it, we track -- we\u2019ve always made sure that we don\u2019t need to do mergers to make our business successful and that was one of the reasons that we\u2019ve always been proud of what Kroger has done. We\u2019re super excited about Albertsons and the potential, and we believe we will be able to add a ton of value for giving customers better value. The people there will be able to provide security and grow our business and create additional career opportunities and support communities, but if it doesn\u2019t happen we\u2019ll continue to go on. As you know, we always will continue to look at how ways to grow the business. Mergers is always one of those ways of growing the business. But we try to make sure that we only do a merger when it makes sense, and we\u2019re not chasing something and we won\u2019t get in a position where we are having to chase something. So great question, and thanks, Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As of the second quarter, Kroger had made a point in its presentation that it was on track to deliver more than 20% media growth this year and that line was removed this quarter. So is it right to interpret that the media growth, which is an important driver of the alternative revenue stream is starting to slow, perhaps, as there are more adverts -- net more platforms for advertisers to choose and direct its advertising dollars. And if that\u2019s the case, how does Kroger accelerate that element of its algorithm in order to support the long-term outlook for the business?\nTodd Foley: Yeah. Let me start there, Michael. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good call. We do still expect to see our retail media growth being that in that 20% range for the year. It\u2019s still a fast growing part of our business and the outcomes that we\u2019re seeing continue to demonstrate that we\u2019re well positioned for that growth. As we look at those CPGs that are advertising with us, we see the outsized return on ad spend that they\u2019re generating and so that\u2019s why I say we\u2019re able to demonstrate and we\u2019re seeing those results. And not coincidentally, the sales for those CPGs at Kroger are strong and so I think the proof points continue to be there, but as you say, there\u2019s a proliferation of options as everybody\u2019s kind of got their own flavor of what this is. So I think we just need to continue to demonstrate that the CPGs, because I think the proof will be in the results.\nRodney McMullen: Todd\u2019s last point to me, and if CPGs are listening in, that\u2019s the only reason why I\u2019m adding on top. The CPGs that increased spending the most had the highest tonnage growth with us, which to me is, it shows you the power of our platform and Todd said it, I just wanted to double down on it.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. And my follow-up question is, what do you need to drive -- what do you need to happen in order to drive The Kroger to achieve the sales piece of its long-term algorithm in 2025? This year, there\u2019s been a contribution from the GLP-1 drug, some storm-related spending, perhaps those won\u2019t be as meaningful contributors next year. So is it that you would be banking on A, market share stabilizing and is that realistic; and B, some acceleration in inflation to offset what had been driving some of the comp this year?\nRodney McMullen: Yeah. We would not be dependent on inflation and it\u2019s really we continue to double down on the customer experience. And when we find that we improve the customer experience, our business follows that or the customer rewards us for that. And it\u2019s -- it really gets back to you\u2019ve heard us say it a million times Full, Fresh & Friendly. The other thing that we\u2019re increasingly supporting is allocating capital to growth areas and that would be storing, obviously, continuation of Seamless or online business continues to have outside growth and then specific projects that support cost reductions and sales opportunities.\nTodd Foley: Yeah. I agree, everything you said, Rodney, especially the storing that you hit on earlier as well. You mentioned GLP-1 and that certainly has been part of this year, but as we sit here today, I think we continue to expect to see growth in that area as more manufacturers get in the mix and the supply continues to become more available and more and more patients continue to utilize that drug. So I think we\u2019ll still see -- expect to see growth in the GLP-1 space as well for the -- at least near future, foreseeable future.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. Your lines are open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Heinbockel: Hey, Rodney. Can you talk about the, you referenced in your release, the initiatives -- productivity initiatives on in-store order selection and how broadly is that rolled out? And when I think about how much you can take the cost per order down, can you take that down a double-digit from where we are today?\nRodney McMullen: Over time, we would certainly expect to take it down double-digit from where we are today. And when I talk about over time, I\u2019m talking about over the next two years or three years and it\u2019s -- we still have a reasonable amount to roll it out. Now, as you, you followed Kroger long enough to know that we will start -- whenever we roll something out, we start with the biggest opportunity places first. So it\u2019s the highest volume locations and those kinds of things. The thing that I think is fascinating and exciting is, if you look at the fundamental things behind the software, we\u2019re learning that we can actually use that same technology in other areas of the business and I would hope that we\u2019ll continue to find those kinds of opportunities. So I feel confident and comfortable that certainly, well, double-digit type stuff of improvement. But our team\u2019s not going to be satisfied until they get to where it\u2019s indifferent, how somebody shops with us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask first, did I miss the fuel CPG contribution for this quarter? Wondering if you could give some added color there and then just had a follow-up?\nTodd Foley: Yeah. Thanks, Michael. We don\u2019t typically -- we stopped a few quarters ago, given in details around CPG. You did catch on to the point that I think that, that Rodney brought out that both gallons and CPG were down in the third quarter. Again, some of the volatility in fuel, but as we looked at the fourth quarter relative to our expectations versus a year ago we think fuel will be a little bit -- our expectation is that fuel will be a little bit more stable year-over-year in Q4 and that\u2019s supported by some of the trends that we\u2019ve seen over the last few periods in both gallons and, and margins.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Dickerson of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRobert Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. Rodney, I know you set up front and it seems like consumer sentiment is still low, but maybe there are some green shoots, maybe it\u2019s improving a little bit. So I\u2019m just wondering kind of as you got through the Thanksgiving holiday and then as we\u2019re kind of real time in the current holiday season, like you have -- have you seen any incremental almost like sequential traffic improvement in the actual retail stores?\nRodney McMullen: We feel good about where we are. The thing, I guess, I would say that we still don\u2019t quite under, it\u2019ll take time is there\u2019s five less shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we feel good about where we are. We\u2019re tracking a little bit better than where we thought we would be. But we still are cautious because of the five less shopping days and how does that play out? And as you mentioned, we are seeing the customer, most of the customers are starting to feel a little bit more relaxed and comfortable in terms of where they stand and what\u2019s coming -- what -- how things look going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacob Aiken-Phillips of Melius Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJacob Aiken-Phillips: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to go back to inflation a little bit. So you showed that you were able to kind of leverage SG&A given like flat comps excluding KSP. How do we think about that relationship going forward in terms of wage inflation and wage investment? And then also with tariffs, we\u2019re of the view that it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy in terms of like people buying stuff and causing inflation, even if there aren\u2019t actually tariffs happening. I just wanted your thoughts on that.\nTodd Foley: Yeah. I\u2019ll start with the wage inflation -- the wage investments. It\u2019s a great question. We\u2019ve talked a lot about how important it is for us to invest in our associates because they\u2019re so critical delivering our customer experience. But we will continue to balance those wage investments with the other profitability enhancement items that we say. So in any inflationary environment and in any sales leverage environment, we\u2019ve demonstrated that our model enables us to pull the levers to be able to balance those wage increases accordingly over time. So given the comments that we said with fairly balanced inflation, we think we\u2019ll be able to leverage our SG&A including wage investments. Rodney, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on the tariffs.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah. Tariffs for us, first of all, the effect on us is probably a little less than most companies and we buy product internationally, but it\u2019s pretty modest. If you look in the Fresh departments, it\u2019s less than 20% of the stuff. If you look in the center store, it\u2019s a fraction of that. So we would see the tariffs affecting others generally more than us and we feel like we\u2019ll be able to manage whatever is done because our competitors will have to deal with the same thing. Thanks Jacob.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nChuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone. Rodney, you mentioned that the mainstream and premium customers were pretty close to spending how they had been before COVID. But there also is from what I can observe, the groups that are more likely to be going to restaurants, which seem to be doing fairly well right now. How do you sort of offset that with Kroger\u2019s prepared food offerings and maybe what changes are you making in those categories?\nRodney McMullen: Well, first of all, we believe that that\u2019s a huge opportunity. Our market share -- half of meals bought at a restaurant is consumed in a car or at home. Actually, I think it\u2019s a little over half. So we see that as a huge opportunity. I would say we\u2019re trying a lot of different things. We have -- we\u2019re working with a couple of outside companies trying to help us there. But to me it\u2019s more of -- in the future we have a bigger opportunity than we\u2019ve been able to unlock so far and we believe it\u2019s a huge opportunity because what we\u2019ve found is that a customer can buy a meal from us and it\u2019s usually the cost is one-third to one-fourth versus going out to a restaurant. So it\u2019s -- for us, it\u2019s a great opportunity, but we\u2019re just scratching the surface.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will take no further questions. So I\u2019ll hand back to Rodney for any further remarks.\nRodney McMullen: Thank you for all the questions. And as always, we have a lot of our associates listening in. First, I would like to send our thoughts and prayers to those impacted by the recent hurricanes. I would also like to take a moment to express my gratitude and appreciation for our dedicated team of associates, especially during this time. They just did amazing things on supporting communities. And as you know, our stores are vital to each community we serve and during these types of times, our customers rely on us to provide them with food and other essential items. And I am so proud of our associates who have stepped up to be there for our customers, communities and each other. Thank you for everything that you do for Kroger and our customers. And thank you for everyone joining us today. We wish you a very happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining today\u2019s call.

            "name": "Rodney McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our third quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the third quarter and walk through updates to our full year guidance. And finally, I will close with some comments on our pending merger with Albertsons. Turning first to our performance, we delivered strong third quarter sales results led by our pharmacy and digital performance, which reflects the versatility of our model. Customer engagement remains strong. Our convenient, Seamless shopping experience, along with incredible customer value through low prices, personalized offers and great quality Our Brand products, drove growth in both total and loyal households. As we entered the last quarter of 2024, we are focused on providing the quality, Fresh and affordable products that make holiday celebrations special. Customer spending habits continue adjusting to current macroeconomic factors. As inflation normalizes, our premium and mainstream households are feeling more confident and are returning to their pre-pandemic shopping patterns more quickly. Mainstream households are the primary driver of our positive customer engagement trends. While overall consumer sentiment remains low, expectations are improving, which positions us well for the holidays and into next year. As we said, near-term, some customers are managing macroeconomic uncertainty. Spending from budget-conscious households remain under pressure, as the effects of multiyear inflation and higher interest rates have had a larger impact on these households. Therefore, we expect it will take longer for these households to fill the benefits of economic improvement. Kroger is delivering on its longstanding commitment to provide customers with the value they are seeking. We are helping customers save in multiple ways, including competitive shelf prices and loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and an expanded multi-tier Our Brands portfolio. Digital offers are an important way we deliver savings to customers and engagement continues to grow. With 5% more digital offer clips so far this year and that has led to 14% more savings for Kroger customers. We are always creating additional ways for our customers to save. This quarter, we celebrated and thanked our customers with a Customer Appreciation Week, offering new great deals, and to help our customers enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, we lowered the price of Thanksgiving meals for the third consecutive year, by creating a meal bundle that served a group of 10 people for less than $5 per person. We are focused on executing our go-to-market strategy to deliver a differentiated customer experience through our focus areas of Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and Seamless. We appreciate our associates' continued efforts to elevate the customer experience and bringing this strategy to life by improving on our key priorities of Full, Fresh & Friendly again this quarter. I would now like to cover how we are enhancing our go-to-market strategy. We are seeing long runways for growth in many areas of our strategy, starting with Fresh. Customers connect strongly to our Fresh for Everyone brand promise, which is a key differentiator for Kroger. Improvements across the supply chain as part of our end-to-end Fresh initiative are increasing days of freshness. For example, bagged salads now offer customers more than seven days of freshness. Customers are noticing and it has led to identical sales in produce of more than 3% this quarter. In addition, we constantly evaluate new ways to apply data and technology to provide an even better Fresh experience and deliver more days of freshness for our customers. One of the ways we are doing this is through recent implementation of RFID-embedded labels on bakery items. These labels provide us with greater insights into our Fresh inventory, resulting in consistently fresher items and higher in-stock levels. We have seen encouraging results, including higher sales, in locations and categories where we have piloted the RFID labels and we look forward to scaling this to more stores. Turning to Our Brands, I would like to step back and talk about the significant investments we have made in Our Brands and how those investments are delivering value to both customers and shareholders. For years, the grocery industry offered private label products with the primary goal of creating products at lower price points. Several years ago, we recognized an untapped opportunity for growth in these products and envisioned a future where our private label products would match or exceed the innovation, quality and recognition of national brands, which is why we coined the phrase, Our Brands. Guided by that vision, our teams built distinct and recognizable brands that our customers want and love, providing more value and meeting unique product needs that national brands cannot fill. Recently, we focused in on refining Our Brand architecture to optimize the portfolio and ensure each brand plays a unique role on the shelf. The successful addition of Smart Way, our new opening price point brand, played an important role in rounding out our multi-tiered portfolio and offering an attractive alternative to national brands at every price point. The next phase of the work involved refreshing designs and packaging, enhancing brand equity, and reinforcing quality and improving the shopability. For example, to reinforce our longstanding guarantee of quality and freshness, we are placing guarantees on labels across our Kroger branded products. Innovation remains a driving force for Our Brands' growth. We utilize our data and insights to understand customer trends and meet increasing demands by consistently introducing new items to our portfolio with a focus on growth areas, including free-from, organic, and multicultural. This innovation enables us to differentiate ourselves from both national brands and other private label brands, creating destination items that help build customer loyalty. Our manufacturing capabilities will continue to be an important advantage for Our Brands. With oversight over the quality and the supply, we can develop unique and differentiated products while keeping costs low, allowing us to pass the savings to customers while preserving our ability to grow margins, a true win-win for customers and Kroger. This quarter, Our Brands continue to deliver strong financial results, which Todd will cover in more detail. Next, to Personalization. Our Kroger Plus program provides our loyal customers access to savings and rewards that in turn drive traffic to our Seamless experience. As customers become more engaged, we gain deeper insights into customer trends while creating the data that enables us to grow Kroger Precision Marketing and deliver more effective promotions and relevant product recommendations. We are working to grow Boost, the next level of our loyalty program, through new benefits and this quarter we announced the addition of Disney+, Hulu or ESPN+ streaming benefits with Boost annual memberships. Turning to Seamless, digital sales grew 11%, driven by an increase in both households and traffic. Within digital, delivery sales grew at 18% and continues to outpace other channels. Boost is one of the important ways we are increasing e-commerce penetration, providing customers an affordable membership model for free delivery. Increasing e-commerce penetration is important to our model, as households who shop with us digitally and are in our stores are our most loyal customers and increase retail media monetization opportunities as well. As our digital business grows, particularly in our delivery network, it continues to have a larger impact on our financial results. Improving profitability is a key priority and becoming even more important to our financial model. Over nearly a decade, we made significant investments in our digital capabilities, building out our own properties, creating distribution channels in both pickup and delivery, investing in automation, enhancing Personalization and introducing an industry-leading retail media network. While each of these capabilities required significant investments, we now have a unique digital experience that our customers enjoy. Moving forward, we are committed to growing volumes, utilizing automation, and introducing new technology that will create efficiency gains while helping us narrow the profitability gap between online and in-store. Narrowing that gap will generate meaningful operating margin benefits and help drive shareholder value over the next several years. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we are building loyalty, increasing customer engagement and creating more growth opportunities, first with alternative profit businesses, which had another solid quarter. Kroger Precision Marketing continued to deliver the most significant growth from our alternative profit businesses. Next, in Health & Wellness, as the pharmacy industry continues to transform, Kroger has a unique opportunity to play a bigger role in helping patients live healthier lives while growing our share of the industry. We are excited about this area of the business and its performance. This quarter demonstrates we can grow this business profitably in a way that supports our customers to live healthier lives. Sales and profitability this quarter were well ahead of last year, led by growth in both GLP-1s and vaccines. Our strong growth in vaccines reflect patient trust in Kroger to vaccinate them and their families during the start of the cold and flu season, the peak quarter of the year for vaccinations. Our Health & Wellness teams did an excellent job this quarter in building awareness around our vaccine capabilities, growing share, and administrating significantly more vaccines this year versus a year ago. These helped offset the product mix pressures from GLP-1s. Our vaccine efforts are leading to new patient scripts, which is important as these customers are more likely to become loyal households and spend more across the store. We appreciate our associates for their continued efforts to elevate the customer experience by delivering on our key priorities of Full, Fresh & Friendly. Team consistency leads to a better customer experience and we are excited about another quarter of improvement in retention. Our focus on retention reflects a holistic strategy, including investments in wages and benefits, as well as enhancing the associate experience through training, technology and career development opportunities. With that, I will hand it over to Todd to take you through our third quarter financial results. Todd? Thanks, Todd. Before I open it up to Q&A, I'd like to speak briefly about our pending merger with Albertsons. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our associates and their incredible commitment. It has been a long journey and our associates have done an excellent job serving customers and running the day-to-day operations of our business while also preparing for the merger. I would like to extend a special thanks to those who supported the litigation in federal and state courts, both the associates who testified and the teams who prepared a compelling case about the meaningful and measurable benefits of the merger. Our teams are ready to ensure a Seamless transition for our customers and associates from day one. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both Kroger and Albertsons organizations, and we look forward to combining these strengths to provide customers with an even better experience. As we await the court rulings and the regulatory challenges to the merger, we remain confident in the facts and the strengths of our position. The retail industry continues to be more competitive and we know how our customers shop. Every day they are making decisions on where to eat and where to buy their groceries. They shop at a wide range of competitors, from Costco to Amazon to Dollar Stores, and they eat at restaurants. They shop digitally and brick-and-mortar. And as I've said before, we remain committed to closing the merger because it will provide meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, for associates and for communities across the country, and we look forward to bringing these commitments to life. Regardless of the outcome of the trials, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and we are optimistic about our future. Our business is more diverse than ever and our value creation model provides us with multiple ways to drive sustainable growth. Our strong free cash flow and strengthened balance sheet provides us with the ability to invest in our business and enhance shareholder value. With that, Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are still in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning. And longer term, as everyone knows, the alternative business -- profit businesses will continue to see a great opportunity and the margins on that business is meaningfully higher than the supermarket business, and the whole flywheel between our brick-and-mortar business and our Seamless business pickup and delivery is the engine behind driving that continuation there, which we're very excited about. Yeah. The mainstream customers certainly performed, connected with us better in the third quarter than the second quarter. How much of that is driven because of things we did and how much they're just feeling better, we don't know. Now they're telling us they feel better. And certainly customers that are on a budget continue to be under a lot of strain and the accumulation of inflation and other aspects and higher interest rates continue to affect them more. And I think the other thing that's always important to remember is, that customer in many cases are starting out in careers and things and they don't have as many physical assets on a house or a little bit of savings and those things, and those -- inflation obviously affects that person a little harder than others. Thanks, Simeon. Yeah. Todd, I'll let you start. Todd said this, but I think it's important to just highlight it. If you look at the range for the year, fuel in the third quarter was a tougher quarter than what we expected it to be and that really relative to the top side. And the other thing that Todd mentioned, we don't budget weather because we just don't know. Obviously there's been some major storms, but those storms haven't been in places where we operate stores. So it really hasn't affected us so far. And generally that's a positive when we have weather because people eat at home as opposed to going to restaurants. I would say we're very happy, but the thing that I guess I get more excited about is the potential, because it's an incredible value for customers and customers love it and we have a high renewal rate and a high NPS score. So our job is to continue to educate more customers on it. So I'm really more excited about the opportunity going forward and the overall deeper connection with customers. So great question. Thanks, Rupesh. Yeah. No. A great question. Maybe still a little early to think about next year, but you think about where we were this year, obviously, coming into the year, we were coming out of that crazy disinflation that we had a year ago. And inflation has played out more or less the way we expected. It's maybe a little bit less than what we expected, but it's been relatively stable at just under 1%. Maybe even saw, I think, a slight step back in Q3 relative to Q2, which as we said, we expect to see for next year. As we look to next year at this point, looking at both some of the macro and governmental studies, as well as conversations with vendors. Again, it's still early to tell. And we might see a slight expansion to inflation next year, but really don't expect to see anything meaningfully different or inconsistent with what we're kind of seeing right now with inflation. Well, we are -- as I mentioned, we're testing it. We're happy with the initial result. The benefits are as much helping our associates be able to do their job a little bit easier. And it's too early -- it's early enough to be excited about the potential. It's too early to say this much we can budget in terms of what we would do. But the thing that we're excited about for our customers, it's helping us make sure we have fresher product for the customer and stay in stock better. And it's super exciting. We will look at other areas of the store to see what kind of opportunity it is. The cost per tag is still higher than we would like, so we still need to continue to work on focusing on the get the cost per tag down. But positive early results, really early in the process and excited about the potential. Thanks, Leah. And it would be way too early to tell you specifics, and obviously, we're waiting for the ruling on the merger, which will affect guidance as well. The other thing that I guess from a positive standpoint that I'm excited about, in the third quarter, we opened or expanded the most number of stores that we've done. I think it's actually in a quarter in seven years. And as you know, last year we talked about it that we will open more stores this year than we have in several years and we would expect to continue to open more stores. And so far, the stores that we've opened, we're happy with the way they're connecting with customers and we're happy in terms of the volumes they're creating and the early read on the profitability of the stores as well. So over time, we would hope that that would continue to be a tailwind, and obviously, on Seamless, we continue to see that as really critical to our five-year or 10-year future to be awesome there and we still have a lot of work to do to make where we're indifferent, whether somebody shops with us online or in-store and we'll continue to put a lot of effort there. In terms of headwind, Todd, I'll let you add anything that you can think of. Yeah. I guess a little bit of both. The -- if you look at tonnage growth in CPGs, there's a lot of CPGs that cannot be satisfied with their tonnage growth. And I believe that trade dollars and being more aggressive on partnering with us to make sure the right customer gets access to those benefits is good long-term for the customer, a long-term benefit for both of us on tonnage. If they're not willing to do that, it really gets back to the comment that we talked about. Our Brands and Todd and I both mentioned it had a strong quarter, the profitability of Our Brands is several hundred basis points higher than national brand. And if the CPGs are willing to continue to give up share to Our Brands we're okay with that because what we find is once a customer tries Our Brand, the repeat rate of customers coming back is incredibly high because what they find is they have -- there's no compromise on quality and they have a great value for the money. So, at the end of the day, the customer wins when they buy Our Brands, but it really is we try to run a business where the customer decides what they want to buy as opposed to forcing them to buy something. Thanks Ken. Good morning. I totally agree with everything Todd said. And Todd said the big pieces, I would also add a couple of smaller pieces that's helping on gross margin that should continue is if you look at our warehouse and transportation costs, continue to make some progress there and the customer continues to buy more value-added product and Fresh continues to grow as well. So those are things that help on mix and in addition to things that Todd talked about. Yeah. It's a great question. If you look at the balance sheet capacity that we have, there's probably no -- nothing else that would be transformational that would use the balance sheet capacity that we would have. So I don't know that we would be out there trying to find what's the next Albertsons. As you know and you just said it, we track -- we've always made sure that we don't need to do mergers to make our business successful and that was one of the reasons that we've always been proud of what Kroger has done. We're super excited about Albertsons and the potential, and we believe we will be able to add a ton of value for giving customers better value. The people there will be able to provide security and grow our business and create additional career opportunities and support communities, but if it doesn't happen we'll continue to go on. As you know, we always will continue to look at how ways to grow the business. Mergers is always one of those ways of growing the business. But we try to make sure that we only do a merger when it makes sense, and we're not chasing something and we won't get in a position where we are having to chase something. So great question, and thanks, Ed. Todd's last point to me, and if CPGs are listening in, that's the only reason why I'm adding on top. The CPGs that increased spending the most had the highest tonnage growth with us, which to me is, it shows you the power of our platform and Todd said it, I just wanted to double down on it. Yeah. We would not be dependent on inflation and it's really we continue to double down on the customer experience. And when we find that we improve the customer experience, our business follows that or the customer rewards us for that. And it's -- it really gets back to you've heard us say it a million times Full, Fresh & Friendly. The other thing that we're increasingly supporting is allocating capital to growth areas and that would be storing, obviously, continuation of Seamless or online business continues to have outside growth and then specific projects that support cost reductions and sales opportunities. Thanks, Michael. Over time, we would certainly expect to take it down double-digit from where we are today. And when I talk about over time, I'm talking about over the next two years or three years and it's -- we still have a reasonable amount to roll it out. Now, as you, you followed Kroger long enough to know that we will start -- whenever we roll something out, we start with the biggest opportunity places first. So it's the highest volume locations and those kinds of things. The thing that I think is fascinating and exciting is, if you look at the fundamental things behind the software, we're learning that we can actually use that same technology in other areas of the business and I would hope that we'll continue to find those kinds of opportunities. So I feel confident and comfortable that certainly, well, double-digit type stuff of improvement. But our team's not going to be satisfied until they get to where it's indifferent, how somebody shops with us. We feel good about where we are. The thing, I guess, I would say that we still don't quite under, it'll take time is there's five less shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we feel good about where we are. We're tracking a little bit better than where we thought we would be. But we still are cautious because of the five less shopping days and how does that play out? And as you mentioned, we are seeing the customer, most of the customers are starting to feel a little bit more relaxed and comfortable in terms of where they stand and what's coming -- what -- how things look going forward. Yeah. Tariffs for us, first of all, the effect on us is probably a little less than most companies and we buy product internationally, but it's pretty modest. If you look in the Fresh departments, it's less than 20% of the stuff. If you look in the center store, it's a fraction of that. So we would see the tariffs affecting others generally more than us and we feel like we'll be able to manage whatever is done because our competitors will have to deal with the same thing. Thanks Jacob. Well, first of all, we believe that that's a huge opportunity. Our market share -- half of meals bought at a restaurant is consumed in a car or at home. Actually, I think it's a little over half. So we see that as a huge opportunity. I would say we're trying a lot of different things. We have -- we're working with a couple of outside companies trying to help us there. But to me it's more of -- in the future we have a bigger opportunity than we've been able to unlock so far and we believe it's a huge opportunity because what we've found is that a customer can buy a meal from us and it's usually the cost is one-third to one-fourth versus going out to a restaurant. So it's -- for us, it's a great opportunity, but we're just scratching the surface. Thank you for all the questions. And as always, we have a lot of our associates listening in. First, I would like to send our thoughts and prayers to those impacted by the recent hurricanes. I would also like to take a moment to express my gratitude and appreciation for our dedicated team of associates, especially during this time. They just did amazing things on supporting communities. And as you know, our stores are vital to each community we serve and during these types of times, our customers rely on us to provide them with food and other essential items. And I am so proud of our associates who have stepped up to be there for our customers, communities and each other. Thank you for everything that you do for Kroger and our customers. And thank you for everyone joining us today. We wish you a very happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year."

            "name": "Todd Foley",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results reflect the durability of our model with strong pharmacy results that helped offset lower fuel profitability as we cycled strong fuel results from a year ago. As we head into the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing the ranges on our identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. The strength of our model gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on this full year guidance. Before I walk through our third quarter financial results, I would like to start off by covering a couple of items from the quarter that affected our financial results. First, during the third quarter, we finalized the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business for $464 million. The sale reduced total company sales in the third quarter by approximately $340 million, compared to the same period last year, and annualized sales will be approximately $3 billion lower going forward. KSP was a low-margin business. As a result, the sale of the business increased both Kroger's gross margin and operating general and administrative costs as a rate of sales. It had no material effect on operating profit. Second, on a year-over-year basis, the combined hurricane season and port strike had approximately a 20-basis-point favorable impact on sales as customers stocked up in anticipation of these events. These events had an unfavorable impact on OG&A. Together, this did not have a material impact on total operating profit. I'll now take you through our third quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 2.3%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, identical sales without fuel were led by strong pharmacy and digital sales. We're also encouraged by the continuation of positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households. Our Brands had a strong quarter, with sales outpacing national brands again this quarter, led by mid-single-digit growth in our most premium brand, Private Selection. Customers continue to demand premium products, but at the same time are looking for value. Our Private Selection brand is a perfect solution by offering our customers premium quality at an attractive price. These results demonstrate the breadth of Our Brands portfolio and the ability to meet customers' needs for quality and value. Digital sales delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, led by 18% growth in delivery solutions, driven by our customer fulfillment centers. The CFCs are offering customers a superior digital experience with excellent in-stocks, fresh items and a white-glove on-time delivery. CFC growth was driven by a significant increase in households and trips, as well as an increase in basket size. Our third quarter identical sales without fuel results were affected by the Boar's Head recalls that began in the second quarter. We acted quickly, with the safety of our customers in mind, as soon as we became aware of the situation. Boar's Head is a strategic supplier with brand-loyal customers that are an important driver of our deli sales. As a result, some customers have temporarily migrated away from the category. It will take some time for those customers to resume their prior purchasing behavior and we expect this to remain a headwind to sales in the near term. The unfavorable sales effect from Boar's Head this quarter was largely offset by the favorable sales impact from the hurricane and port strike. Turning to margins, gross margin was 22.9% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 51 basis points compared to last year and was ahead of expectations. The increase in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, Our Brands performance and lower strength, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. The result reflected Kroger's ability to improve margin while being competitive on price and helping customers manage their budgets. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 22 basis points, driven by the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and increased incentive plan costs, partially offset by the continued execution of cost savings initiatives. Excluding the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, fuel and adjustment items, our OG&A rate to sales would have been nearly flat year-over-year, demonstrating that our model can leverage expenses when we achieve our long-term ID sales without fuel goal of 2% to 4%. This is made possible by a relentless focus on productivity and cost savings initiatives, which remain an essential part of our model. These initiatives are focused on simplification and utilizing technology to enhance the associate experience without impacting the customer experience. This quarter, we launched a new, internally developed, generative AI-powered sell-through tool, which helps us better manage inventory in both Fresh and center store departments through real-time insights tracking sales and shipments. This enables our teams to increase freshness on shelves and prioritize sell-through, optimizing both sales and margins. Looking ahead, we plan to further enhance the AI capabilities on this platform by extending into improved forecasting and end-to-end inventory management. During the third quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $4 million, compared to a charge of $29 million for the same period last year, due to lower expected year-over-year inflation. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.02 billion and adjusted EPS was $0.98 per diluted share, an increase of 3% compared to last year. Fuel is an important part of our strategy. Fuel rewards, through our Kroger Plus program, help build customer loyalty. Fuel sales were significantly lower this quarter compared to last year, attributable to a lower average retail price per gallon. Fuel profitability was also meaningfully behind a year ago, as a result of fewer gallons sold and lower cents per gallon margin. I wanted to provide a brief update on inflation, as it remains a topic of interest for many investors. Inflation was down slightly in the third quarter, compared with the second quarter, but remains around 1%. We expect inflation to remain consistent in the fourth quarter. I would now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for Dillon's Columbia, Missouri clerks, Central Division, Ottawa and Streeter clerks, Northern Illinois meat clerks, Fred Meyer Portland retail stores and the Foods Co. contract in Northern California, all covering nearly 13,000 associates. We respect associates' right to collectively bargain. We're also communicating to local unions that coming to the table with proposals that do not balance investing in associates with keeping groceries affordable for our customers and supporting a growing and profitable business model are untenable. These proposals stand in the way of operating our business in a way that ensures job security and advancement opportunities for associates. Turning to cash flow, Kroger continues to generate strong adjusted free cash flow through consistent operating results. Free cash flow generation is an important part of our model and is enabling us to invest in our business for growth. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.21, compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides us flexibility to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for our shareholders. We're committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time subject to board approval, and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. I would now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. After delivering solid third quarter results, we're narrowing the ranges of identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. Additionally, we have updated our guidance for adjusted effective tax rate and expect it to be 22.5%. We now expect identical sales without fuel for the year to be in the range of 1.2% to 1.5%. With quarter-to-date trends signaling, we will be near the midpoint of this range. Identical sales without fuel results year-to-date have largely been in line with our expectations, with Q3 being slightly ahead of expectations due to favorable effects from the hurricanes, the port strike and strong vaccine growth during the peak season for immunizations. Our expectations for fourth quarter identical sales without fuel are consistent with our forecast at the beginning of the year. We expect Q4 identical sales to remain strong, but sequentially lower than third quarter, partially due to the cycling of weather benefits from the fourth quarter of 2023 that are not built into our current forecast for Q4 2024. We now expect adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. Looking to next year, we are in the process of finalizing our 2025 business plan, while we still have many unknowns, we do expect Kroger to deliver FIFO operating profit growth on a standalone basis. During our fourth quarter earnings call, we plan to share our full year 2025 outlook in more detail. In closing, we are happy to deliver another quarter of strong results, which reflect the resilience of our value creation model. While macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, our model has multiple levers which enable us to navigate any environment, including grocery, Health & Wellness, fuel and alternative profit businesses. This gives us flexibility in the ways we create shareholder value and confidence in our ability to generate attractive and sustainable returns for shareholders. I will now turn the call back to Rodney. Great question, Simeon. Thanks for that and I think that's a fair read on how you've described it. We were obviously very happy with the results that we've seen coming from not only the core business but inclusive of pharmacy, particularly pleased with the results we saw in pharmacy, you heard Rodney talk about today. So despite that lever in fuel giving us a headwind this quarter, we were pleased with the core growth coming from the core business and see that continuing. The mix relative to alternative and core business, I think the growth expectations that we have around the alternative profit business are relatively consistent to what we expected to see and so I think that those continue to be as balanced as we expected going into the quarter. That's a great call, Rodney. We saw the digital growth again at low double-digit growth, which is an important part of the growth that you talked about, Simeon. And that, again, when you talk about mix in our business and our omnichannel, that low double-digit growth is right on what we expected and helps drive both the core business and the alternative profit as Rodney described. Yeah. Well, with one quarter left, Rupesh, we wanted to try to narrow the range because there should be less variability in our expectations. When you look at the sales part of the guidance down at 1.2% to 1.5%, I think, that's pretty consistent with what we've been thinking for the year. The midpoint on that range is a tick higher than I think what we had been thinking before. And frankly, when you look at where we expect to be in Q4, I think that's right on how we've been thinking about it all year relative to all of that. Q3 actually is the one that was really strong and we talked about -- Rodney talked about the pharmacy and the digital growth there, particularly in the vaccine space. We were really pleased. We've been working hard to grow our vaccine business and we saw that throughout the quarters early in this year, but with Q3 being that key vaccine, the Super Bowl season for vaccines, we were really pleased to see that that growth continue and that it paid off in that point in time. So that's where we saw Q3 being really strong and that Q4 guidance being really what we expected. When you look at it on the EPS side of our guidance through past again, narrow the range there. We took a nickel off the top side and the bottom side and really that midpoint of the range is pretty consistent with where we've been thinking about it for the year. As we think about that range and some of the key factors for that range in the fourth quarter, a couple of key things that we're keeping an eye on. One is weather. We alluded to it in our prepared comments. There were several meaningful weather events a year ago that drove some benefits and we just don't forecast weather on a forward-looking basis. So if we see the number and magnitude of weather events in the fourth quarter this year, I think that would be something that could push us towards the higher end of that range. And then the other one is fuel. And certainly we -- fuel tends to be pretty volatile and we've seen that this year and really we have fuel expectations to be pretty in line with where they were last year. And frankly, from a gallon trend and from a $0.01 per gallon trend in the fourth quarter, we're pretty consistent sequentially from where we've been performing over the last few periods. So if we have variance in the fuel profitability, either positive or negative, I think that could lean us towards the top or the bottom end of that range, respectively. We are continuing to see CPGs be a little more aggressive on trade dollars, and over time, that obviously affects inflation a little bit as well. I can't think of anything unusual headwinds or tailwinds as we sit here today, frankly Ken. But going into next year, part of what has us optimistic and feeling good about the strength of our value creation model is a lot of the momentum we have in the things that are in our high growth areas today. We've talked about a lot of them already. It's pharmacy, it's our digital business, it's our alternative profit. And we have good momentum in those spaces and are executing on those. And from a headwind standpoint, we're going to continue to invest in the business. We're going to invest in price. You've heard Rodney say it before. We assume every year is going to be more competitive than the last and that view hasn't changed. And so we'll continue to engage in customers, make sure we're delivering value to them by investing in price and investing in their shopping experience and we're committed to continue to invest in wages. So some of those are headwinds. They're just the parts of our model that is we deliver the value in our model through all their different value propositions. We're able to use that to invest in the business to keep the flywheel moving. Yeah. No. Great question, Ed. And I think you hit on a key part of thinking about it excluding KSP. We talked about, it was a strong quarter in gross margin and about half of that year-over-year benefit was a result of the divestiture. But the other piece of it really came, we highlighted both of, Rodney, layers and what Rodney was just talking about, what was our growth in Our Brands, where we continue to have Our Brands sales growth outpacing national brands and that is always going to drive solid margin expansion. And so that's certainly what we saw again in the third quarter, very similar to what we saw in the second and then shrink had another nice quarter. So we've got cautiously optimistic on the progress we're making there, but we are making progress on the shrink space that really helped us in the third. As we look to the fourth, I think, excluding KSP, I think overall we'll probably be slightly favorable in the fourth, reflecting KSP when you, when you pull that out, I think, we'll probably be relatively flat on that relative to some of the puts and takes. Again, if we over index in things like Our Brands and whatnot, but we may be a little bit favorable, but overall, I think we'll be, we'll be relatively consistent relatively flat year-over-year on the margins in Q4. Yeah. Let me start there, Michael. Thanks for the question. It's a good call. We do still expect to see our retail media growth being that in that 20% range for the year. It's still a fast growing part of our business and the outcomes that we're seeing continue to demonstrate that we're well positioned for that growth. As we look at those CPGs that are advertising with us, we see the outsized return on ad spend that they're generating and so that's why I say we're able to demonstrate and we're seeing those results. And not coincidentally, the sales for those CPGs at Kroger are strong and so I think the proof points continue to be there, but as you say, there's a proliferation of options as everybody's kind of got their own flavor of what this is. So I think we just need to continue to demonstrate that the CPGs, because I think the proof will be in the results. Yeah. I agree, everything you said, Rodney, especially the storing that you hit on earlier as well. You mentioned GLP-1 and that certainly has been part of this year, but as we sit here today, I think we continue to expect to see growth in that area as more manufacturers get in the mix and the supply continues to become more available and more and more patients continue to utilize that drug. So I think we'll still see -- expect to see growth in the GLP-1 space as well for the -- at least near future, foreseeable future. Yeah. Thanks, Michael. We don't typically -- we stopped a few quarters ago, given in details around CPG. You did catch on to the point that I think that, that Rodney brought out that both gallons and CPG were down in the third quarter. Again, some of the volatility in fuel, but as we looked at the fourth quarter relative to our expectations versus a year ago we think fuel will be a little bit -- our expectation is that fuel will be a little bit more stable year-over-year in Q4 and that's supported by some of the trends that we've seen over the last few periods in both gallons and, and margins. Yeah. I'll start with the wage inflation -- the wage investments. It's a great question. We've talked a lot about how important it is for us to invest in our associates because they're so critical delivering our customer experience. But we will continue to balance those wage investments with the other profitability enhancement items that we say. So in any inflationary environment and in any sales leverage environment, we've demonstrated that our model enables us to pull the levers to be able to balance those wage increases accordingly over time. So given the comments that we said with fairly balanced inflation, we think we'll be able to leverage our SG&A including wage investments. Rodney, I don't know if you want to comment on the tariffs."

I'd now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.\nRodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our second quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the second quarter, and finally, I will close with an update on our pending merger with Albertsons. Turning to our performance this quarter, we continue to execute our strategy and we are delivering solid financial results through the strength and diversity of our model. We are driving positive customer activity with a compelling combination of affordable prices and personalized promotions on great quality products, all through a unique seamless experience. Our strong customer trends also reflect our enhanced focus on elevating the customer experience through excellent store execution, which continued into the second quarter. Customers continue adjusting to the current economic environment. The reduction of excess savings built up during the pandemic, higher interest rates and the effect of inflation are pressuring customers' ability to spend. This is especially true for our most budget-conscious customers, as we've been seeing for a while now, but we're now seeing other customer segments beginning to make changes as well. Customers are purchasing lower-priced cuts of meat, buying less and focusing on essentials. Budget-conscious customers are buying more at the beginning of the month to stock up on essential items and groceries. And then as the month progresses, they are more cautious with their spending. In response, we are supporting our customers by keeping prices low through promotions, including loyalty discounts, personalized offers and fuel rewards. We are also expanding our multi-tiered portfolio of Our Brands products, which provides customers exceptional alternatives to national brands competing on quality, while at a noticeable lower price point. Our long term model demonstrates that by consistently keeping prices low, we increase customer loyalty and grow share of wallet. While the food-at-home industry remains competitive, our model drives efficiencies that allow us to sustainably invest in value and maintain competitive price spreads with key competitors. In addition to lowering prices, we executed our go-to-market strategy through our pillars of Fresh, Our Brands, personalization and seamless. We are proud of our associates for bringing this strategy to life with another quarter of excellent store execution. This led to another quarter of strong customer trends, including total and loyal household growth and an increase in customer visits. Mainstream households, our largest customer segment, led our sales growth through more households and increased visits. By delivering a more consistent customer experience, we are moving customers up the loyalty ladder and positioning ourselves for long term sales growth. I'd now like to cover how we are enhancing our go-to-market strategy, starting by leading with Fresh. Our Fresh for Everyone promise reflects our commitment that customers can trust the quality and freshness of every item they purchase. This promise is only possible through our strong relationships with farmers and suppliers, which enables Kroger to source the freshest products. Field & Vine, one of the newest Our Brands lines, offers regionally grown berries picked at peak freshness. We are very pleased with the initial customer response to this line. Our Brands is an important differentiator for our business, enabling us to offer innovative products at a great value. This combination of quality and value led to Our Brands sales growth outpacing national brand sales growth this quarter. More than 90% of our customer households purchased Our Brands products during that time. Across the portfolio of Our Brands, we are expanding into new categories and launching new products with almost 600 already introduced this year. Each of these new products is thoroughly tested and validated to earn its spot on our shelves, competing aggressively with national brands with no compromise on quality. Smart Way, one of our opening price point brands, is delivering exceptional value to customers on a budget. These are ultra low-priced essentials and pantry staples that we know our customers need the most. We continued expanding the Smart Way lineup in the second quarter to meet our customer needs for more value. We are also making progress on Our Brands refreshment roll out, with more of Our Brands portfolio to be refreshed later this year. We are excited to see our customers respond to these new designs. As we innovate within the portfolio and expand to meet customer needs, we are improving our mix and driving better profitability. For example, our manufacturing plants allow us to make many of our own products, keeping costs lower as we pass those savings on to customers while preserving our ability to grow margins. Next is an update on personalization. Our loyalty program and personalized promotions enabled us to deliver value beyond the shelf price. We collect data and insights, which enable us to enhance our personalization capabilities, delivering better product recommendations and more effective promotions. As a result, we are generating greater unit lift on promotions compared to the industry. Boost, our paid membership program supports our personalization capabilities. This quarter, we held a Boost Bonus Days event, which provided Boost customers even more savings during the two week special event. This event went well above and beyond the incredible value the membership already offers with daily savings, free delivery on orders of $35 or more and two times fuel points. Now turning to seamless. Digital sales grew 11%, driven by an increase in both households and traffic. One of the many ways we move customers up the loyalty ladder is to convert digitally-engaged households into e-commerce households. This means we are moving customers from simply using our app or website to making purchases through one of these digital channels. This work resulted in our teams growing e-commerce households 14% this quarter. Households who shop with us digitally and in our stores are important because they are our most loyal and increase retail media and monetization opportunities. Delivery solutions led our sales growth once again this quarter, with pickup also showing very strong demand. Demand across our Kroger delivery network, which provides customers a premium shopping experience, continues to grow. Customers tell us they love the convenience of on-time and refrigerated delivery right to their homes. Profitability remains a key focus as we drive volume growth through our Customer Fulfillment Centers. Our teams are working hard to improve the shape of weekly and daily demand as well as refining trade areas to improve customer delivery density. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we are building loyalty and creating more growth opportunities. First, with alternative profit businesses, which had a strong quarter, led by growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, their results were in line with internal expectations and keep us on track to deliver more than 20% media growth this year. Next is health and wellness, we continue to be optimistic about this area of our business. We know that grocery customers, who are also pharmacy customers, are more loyal to Kroger, and spend more with us. While the pharmacy industry is going through a period of transformation and disruption, we have a unique opportunity to help our customers live healthier lives and grow share. Over the long term, we remain confident and our teams are working hard to navigate industry challenges and position the company for future growth. During the quarter, sales outpaced internal expectations. Profitability was similar to last year, but behind internal expectations due to product mix pressures, specifically as a result of strong GLP-1 sales. We expect GLP-1s to have a similar impact on our results for the remainder of the year. Our vaccine efforts are ramping up now and should help offset some of the GLP-1 impact in the second half of the year. Turning to associates, our full fresh and friendly commitment is our roadmap to achieving a best-in-class customer experience, and we appreciate our associates for delivering again this quarter. We are facilitating this improved customer experience through our commitment to be an employer of choice. We are achieving this by investing in associate wages and by continuing to create an outstanding supportive work environment. It is great to see these efforts recognized with a perfect score on the 2024 Disability Inclusion Equality Index, making Kroger a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the fifth consecutive year. With that, I'll now turn it over to Todd to take you through our second quarter financial results. Todd?\nTodd Foley: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's second quarter results reflect the resilience of our model as investments made to diversify our business are enabling us to navigate an environment of economic uncertainty. Our results through the first half of the year are in line with our expectations, and with our improving sales momentum, we are able to reaffirm our full year guidance. I'll now take you through our second quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 1.2%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, identical sales were supported by several positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households and increased customer visits. We are encouraged by favorable unit trends as we continue to make progress toward achieving positive unit growth. As we saw in the first quarter, vendor support for promotions has been strong, and we will continue to deliver on our long term commitment of providing customers with exceptional value. Digital sales had a strong quarter, led by 17% growth in delivery solutions. Pickup is an important part of our seamless ecosystem and demand continues to be strong, with pickup sales growing 10%. This reflects our digital team's relentless focus on delivering a great customer experience, resulting in increased fill rates, a reduction in wait times and a 33% improvement in perfect orders, which are orders with both a 100% fill rate and that are completed within an appropriate wait time. With the help of AI-enabled advancements and dynamic batching and routing, we are able to offer two hour lead times and pickup in all stores. These improvements in customer experience are being accompanied by productivity enhancements, resulting in an improvement in our cost to serve. Turning to margins, I would like to spend a little more time today talking about our second quarter trends in gross margin and OG&A rates. As you know, our long term model is designed to deliver consistent year-over-year gross margin rate and OG&A rates in a way that we deliver slightly expanding operating margins over time. Though there can be puts and takes in these measures from quarter-to-quarter, over the long term, our business model gives us the flexibility to balance investments in lower prices and higher associate wages with growth in margins through Our Brands and alternative profit businesses as well as cost-saving initiatives and productivity, all to ensure that we are consistently returning value to shareholders. This expectation is true for fiscal 2024 as well. For the full year, we now expect FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, to be slightly positive, balanced by the OG&A rate without fuel, which will be slightly negative. This quarter, FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, was 42 basis points favorable to last year and was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Conversely, the OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, was 65 basis points unfavorable to last year as well as unfavorable to our expectations, primarily due to several nonrecurring charges during the quarter. Looking in more detail at our quarterly results, gross margin was 22.6% of sales. The increase in FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, was primarily attributable to favorable product mix in our grocery business, including Our Brands, lower shrink and sourcing benefits, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. The result reflected Kroger's ability to improve margin while being competitive on price and helping customers manage their budgets. The improvement in shrink reflects the significant ongoing work from our operations team as they address this challenging issue. While we are pleased with the result this quarter, shrink related to theft remains high on a historical basis, and we still have work to do to further mitigate the financial impact. The increase in OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, was driven by investments in associate wages, increased incentive plan costs and nonrecurring costs, including hurricane expenses and an increase in costs due to the severity of general liability claims, partially offset by continued execution of cost savings initiatives. During the second quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $21 million, compared to a charge of $4 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $984 million. Our adjusted EPS was $0.93 per diluted share, a decline of 3% compared to last year. Fuel is an important part of our total value proposition. It builds loyalty through our Kroger Plus program by offering customers another way to save and led to gallon sales outpacing the industry this quarter. Fuel profitability was stronger in the second quarter compared to last year on a cents per gallon basis. In the second half, we will be cycling stronger fuel results, but expect margins to be relatively flat compared to last year. I wanted to provide a brief update on inflation, a topic I am asked about frequently. Inflation increased slightly in the second quarter from the first quarter, but is trending around 1%, which is consistent with our expectations since the start of the year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for our Food 4 Less warehouse stores in Southern California, Columbus Valley stores, Mid-Atlantic Division stores, Anderson Bakery, Michigan, West Michigan and New Market clerks, Central Peoria clerks and Shelbyville warehouse, covering more than 13,000 associates. Kroger is working to reach an agreement with the UFCW for meat and grocery associates at 29 Fred Meyer stores in Portland. We respect our associates' right to collectively bargain. Associates at these stores chose to strike for six days before returning to work last week. Negotiations continue this week, and we remain open to constructive dialogue with the UFCW. We are also communicating to local unions. They are coming to the table with proposals that do not balance investing in associates, with keeping groceries affordable for our customers and supporting a growing and profitable business model are untenable. It underlines our goal of growing the company in a way that helps to ensure job security and create more jobs and advancement opportunities for more associates. Turning to cash flow, Kroger continues to generate strong adjusted free cash flow through consistent operating results. Consistent generation of free cash flow is an important part of our model and is enabling us to deleverage in anticipation of our merger with Albertsons. At the end of the second quarter, Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.24, compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides us flexibility to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for shareholders. We're committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time, subject to Board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. The strength of our free cash flow gives us the ability to invest in the growth of our business. We are allocating more capital to our major and minor store projects this year. Our teams have done an excellent job completing projects ahead of schedule. And year-to-date, we have completed almost double the amount of store projects as we had completed last year at this time, which will position us to grow in the second half of 2024 and 2025. It also creates capacity later this year to work towards opening 2025 projects earlier in the year as well. To reflect this, we are raising our guidance for full year capital expenditures from a range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Based on the strength of our free cash flow, the change to our CapEx guidance does not affect our adjusted free cash flow guidance. In the second quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend by 10%, reflecting confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow. Our quarterly dividend has grown at a 13.5% compounded annual growth rate since being reinstated in 2006, and this marked the 18th consecutive year of dividend increases. I'd now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. We are encouraged by our performance through the first half of the year, which led to results that were in line with expectations. Our solid sales results through the first two quarters of the year give us confidence to raise the low end of our full year identical sales without fuel guidance. We now expect identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.75% to 1.75%. We are cautiously optimistic about our sales outlook for the second half of the year and expect customers to continue prioritizing food and essentials. We have developed merchandising plans that are designed to enhance customer engagement, drive spending and improve unit volumes. The strength of our model enables us to navigate an environment where customer spending is constrained by current economic pressures, and we expect the various components of our model, including grocery, health and wellness, fuel and alternative profit businesses to provide us with flexibility in how we create shareholder value. As a result, we are reaffirming the rest of our full year guidance. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks, Todd. Before I open it up for Q&A, I'd like to speak briefly about our pending merger with Albertsons. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our associates and their incredible commitment. It has been a long journey, and our associates have done an excellent job serving customers and running the day-to-day operations of our business, while also preparing for the merger. Integration work continues to progress, and our teams are laser-focused on ensuring a seamless transition for our customers and associates from day one. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both Kroger and Albertsons organizations, and we look forward to combining these strengths to provide customers an even better experience. As part of our merger preparation, Kroger recently launched an exchange offering for Albertsons notes, contingent upon the closing of the merger as well as a successful new offering for $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes with the net proceeds expected to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the proposed merger. A portion of the proceeds of this offering is subject to a special mandatory redemption if the merger does not close. As the preliminary injunction trial with the FTC nears its conclusion, we are confident in the facts and the strengths of our position. The retail industry continues to be more competitive, and we know how our customers shop. Every day, they are making decisions on where to eat and where to buy their groceries. They shop at a wide range of competitors from Costco to Amazon to Dollar Stores, and they eat at restaurants. They shop digitally and brick-and-mortar. As I have said before, we remain committed to closing the merger because it will provide meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, associates and communities across the country, and we look forward to bringing these commitments to life. Regardless of the outcome of the trials, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and we are optimistic about our future. Our business is more diverse than ever, and our value creation model provides us with multiple ways to drive sustainable growth. We are delivering strong free cash flow that allows us to invest in our business and drive attractive returns for our shareholders. With that, Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nEdward Kelly: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nEdward Kelly: There's been increased concern around the competitive backdrop, rising promotions across the industry. Can you just talk about what you are seeing from a promotional and competitive standpoint? And then what are your plans as you think about the back half of the year? I mean you did raise the gross margin guidance a bit today. So it certainly seems like you believe you can manage it. But just thoughts around what's going on out there and your promotional plans.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah, if you look, I would say the promotions are getting back to pretty much normal. And obviously, during COVID there was less promotions because supply chains were under tremendous pressure. The other thing that we would say on the promotions we are doing, we view -- the ones that we're doing are more effective and the CPG partners are increasing their support for some of those as well as they're trying to grow tonnage. If you look at -- as Todd outlined, overall, we feel good about the balance of the year and balancing cost reductions and mix changes that are helping gross and our continued investment in pricing, which we've been doing for, I think, close to 20 years now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKelly Bania: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to dive in a little bit more on gross margin. It was really quite strong, and you called out some of the factors there. But can you help us just understand how digital is impacting gross margin? Is that included in your kind of mix category? And just a general update on digital profitability as you look forward really into the back half and the next couple of years here?\nTodd Foley: Yes. Be glad to, Kelly. Yes, you're right. As we went into the year, we talked about the expectations for our margins to be relatively flat. And included in that expectation was a little bit of an increase in the second quarter year-over-year. But even on top of that, some of the strength that we saw in Our Brands, like we called out, we had a tremendous quarter in Our Brands, actually, the sales growth there outpaced national brands quite meaningfully that helped drive it above our expectations. And also, we had a great shrink quarter. It's been a while since we've looked year-over-year on shrink and seen positive results. So that's really exciting to see as we called out. Still a lot of work to do there on a go-forward basis. So it was a little bit better than our expectations, which were to be up some, and therefore, for the balance of the year, we do expect for the full year margins to now be slightly favorable on a year-over-year basis. So from a digital profitability standpoint, Rodney, if you want to add anything in that space?\nRodney McMullen: Yes, I'll just a couple of comments. We continue to make progress. If you look at over the next two or three years, we see the opportunity to make significant progress, and we would hold ourselves accountable for doing that. The thing that's pretty special about the overall ecosystem that we're building, is when you look at a customer that engages with us seamless, they actually still physically go into stores. Sometimes they do delivery, sometimes they do pick up. They also become more loyal in other aspects, becoming Boost members, engaging in pharmacy. So as you look out over the next two or three years, we are very excited about the potential of that and the continued progress. Obviously, the media business helps gross margin and the margins in that is significantly different than anything that we've ever sold in the supermarket store. Thanks Kelly.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAnders Myhre: Good morning. This is Anders Myhre on for John. Between the proactive cost reductions, the media growth and the moderating digital losses, should we expect a greater amount of P&L benefits than there have been in recent years? And if so, how much of this incremental benefit flows through to the bottom line versus reinvestment into other areas of the business? Thank you.\nTodd Foley: Yeah. Great question. The things that you call out are great examples of some of the margin enhancement programs that we've talked about in the past as well as some of the productivity improvements and cost improvements that we've realized over time. That's an important part of our overall business model, being able to use that value that we create through the things that you called out to invest it back in the business. Rodney alluded to it. We have a long history of taking that value and reinvesting it back in the business in a way that over time, our operating profit rate grows slightly over time. So as we grow the top line, as we're able to balance the investments with the benefits that we get from those that drives the bottom line over time.\nRodney McMullen: Yes, I think it's always a good reminder that our long term TSR model is 8% to 11% a year. That long term TSR model assumes that we continue to move and grow alternative profit businesses, continue to invest in wages, continue to invest in lower prices for our customers. As you know fortunately, we generate a tremendous amount of free cash flow. We would expect over time for more of that growth to come from the business as opposed to buying back stock. And then once the merger happens, obviously, there's incremental accretion that will happen because of the merger for a period of time that once the merger happens, we'll give more insights into. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Leah Jordan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nLeah Jordan: Good morning. Thank your for taking my question. Thinking if you could comment on your market share trends in the quarter, and especially interested in any color on what you're seeing in Fresh specifically as I know that's been a big area of investment for you?\nRodney McMullen: Yes. If you look at our Fresh trends overall, they would be stronger than the center store. Overall, I would say that we feel okay about where we are. But if you look, going forward, we continue to see improvement, and we would expect to see improvement throughout the balance of the year. So it's one of those areas where we're not satisfied. We are gaining strong household growth and strong loyal household growth as well, which also, in the past, always leads to future progress as well. So I would say that we feel okay where we are. We're more excited about what we see where the trends are and where we see for the balance of the year and next year because we're also incrementally adding storing [ph] as well, which helps on market share as well. Thanks Leah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning, everyone. Two-parter. First, if you look at the second quarter and the second half, the difference in comp that you're guiding to, how is it changing between units and inflation? I heard the inflation piece, but curious how the guidance reflects this. It looks like it's slightly better than consensus. The second part is, if this environment stays, and I know you're not -- you're trying to improve share and grow comps. But if we stay in this very low single-digit environment, do you spend the same way in the business next year, and you think you can keep the core EBIT dollars roughly flat or margin flat in this backdrop? Thank you.\nTodd Foley: Yes. Good question, Simeon. Let me start with the differences in comp. We did update our sales guidance for the year, taking up the bottom end of that range, as you saw from 25 basis points to 75 basis points, but kept the top end of the range at 1.75 basis points. And I think our thought process around that was really to take the low end off the table. If you think about where we came into the year, and there was quite a bit of disinflation last year. That was still kind of hitting us early in the year and wanted to make sure that we were navigating through that uncertainty. Our view at the time was that Q1 would be the low point of the year, and we would consistently grow our sales as we went through the year on a backdrop of inflation that was 1%-ish as we go throughout the year. And that's really -- certainly through the first half, it's played out as we expected in the first half of the year. And our expectations for the back half are very similar to the way that we thought about it back then. So I would say both our expectations on the sales and the inflation environment backdrop against which, it hasn't really changed a whole lot, and we expect that growth to flow. From a unit standpoint, we've talked about that a little bit. Rodney alluded to the fact we continue to be encouraged by the trends there. We're still a little negative on the unit side, but we continue to be encouraged by the progress that we're making in that space and think that will be part of the contribution to the sales trend that we see for the back half of the year.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah, we are seeing progress on units. We would expect to continue to see progress on units. You didn't really ask, but if -- the thing that's right now, what we're seeing is, and I mentioned it earlier, in the first of the month, our business is really strong, holidays are strong. And then when you get to the end of the month, they're weaker because of the people being constrained on a budget. So far in the third quarter, we're tracking a little bit better than where we were in the second quarter. So fundamentally, we believe all the programs we're doing is making improved connection. Your question relative to 2025, I would say it's still early for us to start sharing guidance on 2025, and I would just -- the comments I made earlier about our long term business model really would apply to 2025. Obviously, we would expect to be in a position of where we've just completed a merger, and we would also need to update where we are relative to the merger and the integration of the merger and those factors as well. So thanks, Simeon, for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani: Great. Thank you for taking the question. It seems that the guide is implying a stable or even slightly up EBIT margin in the back half of the year. And I just wanted to understand a little bit if you could parse out the drivers behind that, in particular, with relation to shrink, if there's favorable compares coming up that give you confidence, and/or if there's certain onetime costs that you could quantify for us on OG&A that wouldn't come up again?\nTodd Foley: Yeah. We'll do, Michael. You're right. Great call out. And as we look at the back half of the year, we talked about, given the trends that we saw in the second quarter, our view for the year on gross margin would be that it will be slightly favorable year-over-year. And on OG&A, the annual trend will be slightly unfavorable year-over-year. But we do expect those to reasonably balance as they come out. We talked a little bit about shrink earlier. And again, we're really excited about the results that we saw in shrink, but I mentioned the caution that we have there. There is a lot of work to do. That issue is still out there. And our shrink costs are high relative to history on where we've been this. So our team continues to work in that space and continues to drive it. You can't have a trend until you have a data point. And so we're excited to see where we're at, but we're kind of cautiously optimistic about the opportunities for shrink for the balance of the year. Relative to some of the other costs--\nRodney McMullen: Before you move on, one additional shrink, Michael, that you might -- that everyone might find helpful is if you look at our Fresh side of our business, we've made meaningful progress on improving shrink over several quarters. Now when you look at the center store with organized retail crime and other things, you couldn't see it. But there's been tremendous changes by using technology, AI processes, and our teams have done a nice job of improving the Fresh side on shrink. That's not subject to as much theft, but it's really process-oriented. So now, Todd, I'll let you go and talk about some of the other stuff.\nTodd Foley: Yes. Great color, I appreciate that. Talking a little bit on the cost side, there are -- we did see in the second quarter in part of why it was a little bit worse than our expectations, some non-recurring type of items. The main one was some costs related to Hurricane Beryl that came through. Obviously, that was event-driven relative to that. The second, and we've talked a little bit about this, we've talked about incentive being a little bit higher than our expectations. We do think for the second half of the year that will have less of an impact on our year-over-year OG&A than what we've seen in the past as well. So I think those are a couple of the examples of things that we don't expect to continue in the second half.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Goldman: Hi, thank you and good morning. I wanted to dig in a little bit deeper into inflation, just in light of the CPI and PPI numbers that came out this morning. Usually the two rates have changed. They're not perfectly correlated, but they're somewhat correlated. And right now, PPI food is increasing at a faster clip than CPI. So I just wanted to get a sense for how you think about balancing the need to pass on inflation? I know that PPI is not a perfect proxy for that, but it's somewhat of a proxy. Balance that with the desire to continue to appeal to budget-conscious consumers, and then how do we reconcile all of that with the fact that your GM growth was so good when PPI is growing so much faster than CPI?\nRodney McMullen: Yes. As you've mentioned, I mean, you're always trying to balance all the pieces. Part of the PPI is it's -- certain parts of it are commodity-driven. And we will -- if we think something is a permanent cost increase then we try to pass that along as fast as we can. If it's a short-term blip, then we'll manage that based on what's going on in the market. And it's as difficult now estimating where inflation is going to be as probably any period of time, but we are seeing it being reasonably stable. If you look out in terms of price increases that CPGs have already shared with us because obviously, we'll see that in advance of it happening, it would certainly still be in the range of where we said we think overall inflation will be around 1%. And we don't see anything that's causing us to see that be much different than that. Over time, we do find the two kind of line up pretty close. The other thing that we are seeing is inflation on food away from home is meaningfully higher than food at home. And we are beginning to see customers move back from restaurants to food at home because you can prepare a meal at home for about a fourth of the cost of going out and getting a meal. So that is something that we are beginning to see a little bit of as well. I don't know, Todd, anything else you want to add on inflation?\nTodd Foley: I don't. Thanks, Rodney.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So first on CapEx, so higher range for this year. So I just want to get a sense of if we should think about this level of spend as more of a normal going forward. And then secondly, not sure if you're giving any clarity in terms of how to think about the EPS growth cadence between Q3 and Q4 as I know you're lapping the 53rd week later this year.\nTodd Foley: Yes. Great color, Rupesh. On the CapEx, yes I think we talked about it. We've been working really hard to take the opportunity to get these storing projects open as quickly as we can to be able to serve customers. And so shifting spend from late in '24 to early in '24. You saw our CapEx year-to-date be a little bit higher. That's going to create some capacity to help us pull early -- what might have been early '25 construction process into late '24, so we can open next year's projects early too. So I think given the strong cash flow in the business, if we're able to continue to execute that, then I think what we'll see should be a lift in our spend in our capital plan over time.\nRodney McMullen: And we're -- the money that we're investing, we're seeing good performance to budget as well. And operationally, it's a lot easier to open up a remodel or new store expansion earlier in the year versus later in the year as well.\nTodd Foley: And then talking to your EPS comment, Rupesh, yes, for the balance of -- given where we landed in the first quarter in our actual results -- for the first half of the year, sorry, our first half kind of landed where we expected it to, quarter's played out a little bit differently than we thought. But the first half landed where we expected. And reaffirming the rest of the year, the back half, we think is right on par with where we've been guiding as well. Within that, we do think that the third quarter will be probably slightly ahead of where we were year-over-year and the fourth quarter probably slightly behind on a 52-week basis when you compare it 52 to 52, but that's probably how the trend will play out for the balance of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMark Carden: Good morning. It's Mark Carden on for Michael Lasser this morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So you talked about some of the trade down that's accelerated in 2Q to additional income cohorts, and also highlight some of the pressures that budget customers are facing. What kinds of behavior changes are you seeing in your middle income and above cohorts? And when did you see this become more pronounced?\nRodney McMullen: Yes. It's throughout the year, and as I mentioned before, we're seeing it more at the end of the month than the beginning of the month. And people continue to be aggressive or whatever the right term is on celebrating holidays. Now I think one of the things that's always important to remember is those changes aren't -- many of those changes are beneficial to us. So if you think about people moving from eating at a restaurant to cooking at home, that's beneficial for us. If we look at customers' changing segments, that's good for us because they typically will buy more Our Brands, products and they'll buy smaller packages and some of those things as well. So when we look, it's been really throughout. But I would say, over the last few months, it's been more pronounced as you get toward the end of the month. But all of those things are things that -- obviously, you're changing your promotional approach, your connection with the customers, what offers you make at different times of the month and all those things. So overall, the customer, as we've said all along, are under tremendous strain, especially customers on a budget. That was the reason why I want to say it was probably 1.5 years ago or 2 years ago, we saw that coming, and we introduced our Smart Way product to be much more aggressive on having an entry price point item because that was a trend that we saw coming and trying to be proactive on addressing that, and we continue to add product in that. But for us, we're going to do everything we can to help a customer be able to have a great meal without compromising and eating as a family. And so far, the changes the customer is experiencing, we're making changes to trying to support the customer and the customer is connecting well with that. So you feel for people in terms of where they are, and we're going to do everything we can to try to help support them on what their particular situation is.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ohmes: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Todd, for you, can we get even -- you gave some color already on the OG&A line for the back half. Maybe a little more how -- where is Kroger on the wage pressure in the back half of the year, say versus the front half? And also, you guys called out general liability claims. You're not the only retailer to call that out this quarter. If we get some -- how much pressure was that in the second quarter and is that an issue or a pressure in the back half? Thanks.\nTodd Foley: Yes. No, great call out. Relative to second half OG&A again, given what we saw in the second quarter, our guidance on the year is now we will be slightly unfavorable to where we were a year ago. But beyond that, I think our trends will be as expected in the second half of the year. You talk about wage pressure. One thing to keep in mind on our wage pressure is because so many of our wages come through collective bargaining agreements, we've got 300 or so of those. But at any point in time, probably 75% of our wages are locked in, in a collective bargaining agreement. We have maybe a third or a quarter of those that are up each year that we constantly negotiate. So the guidance that we have out there reflects those expectations and where we're at from a wage perspective because most of those are known to us going into the year. Your comment on GL claims, there's really two pieces to general liability. The incident rate piece is -- actually our results are phenomenal. When you look at it through the lens of OSHA incident rates, we're very much below where the industry averages are at. And even as a company where we're at, we're in that kind of record low territory there, at least in modern history. And so we're extremely excited about the work that the teams do to manage the incidents from that standpoint and the number of claims. What we saw as we were going through our analysis this time was around the average cost of the claim, and what we were seeing relative to the cost to settle some of these claims being much higher. Given the environment that's out there, we're seeing more and more pressure on the average cost to settle those claims. And so as we evaluated what we had outstanding for reserves in that space, given that trend, we thought it was wise to update it. We have done a nice job in the past trying to mitigating those claims and have a variety of strategies to put into place, and we'll continue to be able to put more of those types of items in place to be more effective in keeping that average cost down. But I think the announces that we did, I think, has us comfortable with where we need to be now and we don't expect that to recur in the back half of the year.\nRodney McMullen: One other comment I would add to -- Robbie, to the OG&A comment that Todd was talking about is, we feel like we've developed a good skill on being able to identify cost reductions over time. And we would expect that's a skill that we'll have also as you look out in the second half and forward in next year as well. The other thing that our teams have done a nice job on is continuing to find process changes to be able to operate a store with less labor and simplify the store to run. And it's one of those where we've made good progress, but we still think we have plenty of opportunity to get better going forward. So I really appreciate the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nChuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nChuck Cerankosky: Rodney, when you look at the sales growth challenges, you mentioned the economic factors putting pressure on consumers, and it seems to be a wide range of consumers. But you also have nontraditional competitors put pressure on the supermarket channel. Can you sort of compare what the strengths of those difficult headwinds are as you're trying to accelerate sales at Kroger?\nRodney McMullen: Yeah, the increase in non-traditional competitors, obviously, has been a 20-year trend. And when you look at Amazon and Costco and Walmart and I could go on and on for the litany, those in terms of how do you be successful against them really is how do you continue to change your basic offering to the customer and supporting the customers' changes. And we felt good about those changes that we've made, but we still need to continue to make them. And it's one of those things where, if you ever think you've figured it out, it's -- I would say that it's not good, you need to change. So we feel good about our ability to compete. We'll have to continually change. It's the reason why we've invested so much in staying connected with the customer on a seamless perspective, continuing to invest in wages, continuing to invest in promotion, but making up some of those things with alternative profit growth and mix. And over time, we would hope food away -- a more stronger competitor on food away from home because half of the money that's spent on food is food away from home. And we see no reason why we shouldn't be able to get a share of that. If you look at the economic pressure so far, we feel confident in our ability to deal with it or manage it or whatever because there's -- fortunately, we have a large business, and there's a lot of moving parts. And Our Brands obviously had a strong quarter. We think the opportunity is even stronger in Our Brands and things like that, which helps support the customer that's under that economic pressure as well. So on those so far, I mean, if you had a depression, I wouldn't -- I would give a different answer. But so far on the things that we're seeing, we feel comfortable or confident in our ability to deal with those changes. Thanks Chuck.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJoe Feldman: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nJoe Feldman: I wanted to ask about inventory level, which was down a little bit and down, I think, almost 3%, which is really good shape. I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about inventory going forward? And what drove that? Was it you guys -- is it fewer units? Is it because the prices have just come down a bit year-over-year, so you've been able to be lower inventory levels because of that? Maybe you could just share a little more color around that going forward.\nTodd Foley: Yes. Great question, Joe. And I think you hit on some of the keys. I think it's a variety of things. Inventory, it's -- part of it is we're seeing less cost inflation, so the average cost of an item on the shelf is a little bit less. But we have also been very laser-focused relative to working capital and working capital management. When we talk about our strong cash flow generation, that's an important part of that is balancing our working capital. And it's -- both of those go together. It's always having the right tension between making sure we're in stock for our customers and having what our customers need, but making sure we don't have too much there so that we're being a good steward of working capital. So I think what you're seeing on the balance sheet is the combination of lower cost per item, relative inflation year-over-year and the right level of working capital management to make sure we're in stock for our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will take no further questions for today, so I'll hand back to Rodney for any further remarks.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks, Alex and thank you to all for all your questions. And as you know, before we conclude our call, we always like to -- we have many of our associates listening in, and we always like to share a couple of comments with them. And I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our 2024 Kroger Scholars. Since the Kroger Scholars Program was launched in 2008, we've awarded more than 3,300 scholarships, totaling almost $5 million to children of our associates. These recipients were selected based on a broad range of criteria, including their volunteering activities, civic service, extracurricular activities, academic performance and work experience. And it's always fun to be able to help a little on their education and congratulations to our 120 winners this year. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. And I know it's early, but it will be December before we talk to everyone. I hope everyone has a beginning, great holiday season as well, and thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rodney McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our second quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the second quarter, and finally, I will close with an update on our pending merger with Albertsons. Turning to our performance this quarter, we continue to execute our strategy and we are delivering solid financial results through the strength and diversity of our model. We are driving positive customer activity with a compelling combination of affordable prices and personalized promotions on great quality products, all through a unique seamless experience. Our strong customer trends also reflect our enhanced focus on elevating the customer experience through excellent store execution, which continued into the second quarter. Customers continue adjusting to the current economic environment. The reduction of excess savings built up during the pandemic, higher interest rates and the effect of inflation are pressuring customers' ability to spend. This is especially true for our most budget-conscious customers, as we've been seeing for a while now, but we're now seeing other customer segments beginning to make changes as well. Customers are purchasing lower-priced cuts of meat, buying less and focusing on essentials. Budget-conscious customers are buying more at the beginning of the month to stock up on essential items and groceries. And then as the month progresses, they are more cautious with their spending. In response, we are supporting our customers by keeping prices low through promotions, including loyalty discounts, personalized offers and fuel rewards. We are also expanding our multi-tiered portfolio of Our Brands products, which provides customers exceptional alternatives to national brands competing on quality, while at a noticeable lower price point. Our long term model demonstrates that by consistently keeping prices low, we increase customer loyalty and grow share of wallet. While the food-at-home industry remains competitive, our model drives efficiencies that allow us to sustainably invest in value and maintain competitive price spreads with key competitors. In addition to lowering prices, we executed our go-to-market strategy through our pillars of Fresh, Our Brands, personalization and seamless. We are proud of our associates for bringing this strategy to life with another quarter of excellent store execution. This led to another quarter of strong customer trends, including total and loyal household growth and an increase in customer visits. Mainstream households, our largest customer segment, led our sales growth through more households and increased visits. By delivering a more consistent customer experience, we are moving customers up the loyalty ladder and positioning ourselves for long term sales growth. I'd now like to cover how we are enhancing our go-to-market strategy, starting by leading with Fresh. Our Fresh for Everyone promise reflects our commitment that customers can trust the quality and freshness of every item they purchase. This promise is only possible through our strong relationships with farmers and suppliers, which enables Kroger to source the freshest products. Field & Vine, one of the newest Our Brands lines, offers regionally grown berries picked at peak freshness. We are very pleased with the initial customer response to this line. Our Brands is an important differentiator for our business, enabling us to offer innovative products at a great value. This combination of quality and value led to Our Brands sales growth outpacing national brand sales growth this quarter. More than 90% of our customer households purchased Our Brands products during that time. Across the portfolio of Our Brands, we are expanding into new categories and launching new products with almost 600 already introduced this year. Each of these new products is thoroughly tested and validated to earn its spot on our shelves, competing aggressively with national brands with no compromise on quality. Smart Way, one of our opening price point brands, is delivering exceptional value to customers on a budget. These are ultra low-priced essentials and pantry staples that we know our customers need the most. We continued expanding the Smart Way lineup in the second quarter to meet our customer needs for more value. We are also making progress on Our Brands refreshment roll out, with more of Our Brands portfolio to be refreshed later this year. We are excited to see our customers respond to these new designs. As we innovate within the portfolio and expand to meet customer needs, we are improving our mix and driving better profitability. For example, our manufacturing plants allow us to make many of our own products, keeping costs lower as we pass those savings on to customers while preserving our ability to grow margins. Next is an update on personalization. Our loyalty program and personalized promotions enabled us to deliver value beyond the shelf price. We collect data and insights, which enable us to enhance our personalization capabilities, delivering better product recommendations and more effective promotions. As a result, we are generating greater unit lift on promotions compared to the industry. Boost, our paid membership program supports our personalization capabilities. This quarter, we held a Boost Bonus Days event, which provided Boost customers even more savings during the two week special event. This event went well above and beyond the incredible value the membership already offers with daily savings, free delivery on orders of $35 or more and two times fuel points. Now turning to seamless. Digital sales grew 11%, driven by an increase in both households and traffic. One of the many ways we move customers up the loyalty ladder is to convert digitally-engaged households into e-commerce households. This means we are moving customers from simply using our app or website to making purchases through one of these digital channels. This work resulted in our teams growing e-commerce households 14% this quarter. Households who shop with us digitally and in our stores are important because they are our most loyal and increase retail media and monetization opportunities. Delivery solutions led our sales growth once again this quarter, with pickup also showing very strong demand. Demand across our Kroger delivery network, which provides customers a premium shopping experience, continues to grow. Customers tell us they love the convenience of on-time and refrigerated delivery right to their homes. Profitability remains a key focus as we drive volume growth through our Customer Fulfillment Centers. Our teams are working hard to improve the shape of weekly and daily demand as well as refining trade areas to improve customer delivery density. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we are building loyalty and creating more growth opportunities. First, with alternative profit businesses, which had a strong quarter, led by growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, their results were in line with internal expectations and keep us on track to deliver more than 20% media growth this year. Next is health and wellness, we continue to be optimistic about this area of our business. We know that grocery customers, who are also pharmacy customers, are more loyal to Kroger, and spend more with us. While the pharmacy industry is going through a period of transformation and disruption, we have a unique opportunity to help our customers live healthier lives and grow share. Over the long term, we remain confident and our teams are working hard to navigate industry challenges and position the company for future growth. During the quarter, sales outpaced internal expectations. Profitability was similar to last year, but behind internal expectations due to product mix pressures, specifically as a result of strong GLP-1 sales. We expect GLP-1s to have a similar impact on our results for the remainder of the year. Our vaccine efforts are ramping up now and should help offset some of the GLP-1 impact in the second half of the year. Turning to associates, our full fresh and friendly commitment is our roadmap to achieving a best-in-class customer experience, and we appreciate our associates for delivering again this quarter. We are facilitating this improved customer experience through our commitment to be an employer of choice. We are achieving this by investing in associate wages and by continuing to create an outstanding supportive work environment. It is great to see these efforts recognized with a perfect score on the 2024 Disability Inclusion Equality Index, making Kroger a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the fifth consecutive year. With that, I'll now turn it over to Todd to take you through our second quarter financial results. Todd? Thanks, Todd. Before I open it up for Q&A, I'd like to speak briefly about our pending merger with Albertsons. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our associates and their incredible commitment. It has been a long journey, and our associates have done an excellent job serving customers and running the day-to-day operations of our business, while also preparing for the merger. Integration work continues to progress, and our teams are laser-focused on ensuring a seamless transition for our customers and associates from day one. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both Kroger and Albertsons organizations, and we look forward to combining these strengths to provide customers an even better experience. As part of our merger preparation, Kroger recently launched an exchange offering for Albertsons notes, contingent upon the closing of the merger as well as a successful new offering for $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes with the net proceeds expected to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the proposed merger. A portion of the proceeds of this offering is subject to a special mandatory redemption if the merger does not close. As the preliminary injunction trial with the FTC nears its conclusion, we are confident in the facts and the strengths of our position. The retail industry continues to be more competitive, and we know how our customers shop. Every day, they are making decisions on where to eat and where to buy their groceries. They shop at a wide range of competitors from Costco to Amazon to Dollar Stores, and they eat at restaurants. They shop digitally and brick-and-mortar. As I have said before, we remain committed to closing the merger because it will provide meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, associates and communities across the country, and we look forward to bringing these commitments to life. Regardless of the outcome of the trials, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and we are optimistic about our future. Our business is more diverse than ever, and our value creation model provides us with multiple ways to drive sustainable growth. We are delivering strong free cash flow that allows us to invest in our business and drive attractive returns for our shareholders. With that, Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning. Good morning. Yeah, if you look, I would say the promotions are getting back to pretty much normal. And obviously, during COVID there was less promotions because supply chains were under tremendous pressure. The other thing that we would say on the promotions we are doing, we view -- the ones that we're doing are more effective and the CPG partners are increasing their support for some of those as well as they're trying to grow tonnage. If you look at -- as Todd outlined, overall, we feel good about the balance of the year and balancing cost reductions and mix changes that are helping gross and our continued investment in pricing, which we've been doing for, I think, close to 20 years now. Yes, I'll just a couple of comments. We continue to make progress. If you look at over the next two or three years, we see the opportunity to make significant progress, and we would hold ourselves accountable for doing that. The thing that's pretty special about the overall ecosystem that we're building, is when you look at a customer that engages with us seamless, they actually still physically go into stores. Sometimes they do delivery, sometimes they do pick up. They also become more loyal in other aspects, becoming Boost members, engaging in pharmacy. So as you look out over the next two or three years, we are very excited about the potential of that and the continued progress. Obviously, the media business helps gross margin and the margins in that is significantly different than anything that we've ever sold in the supermarket store. Thanks Kelly. Yes, I think it's always a good reminder that our long term TSR model is 8% to 11% a year. That long term TSR model assumes that we continue to move and grow alternative profit businesses, continue to invest in wages, continue to invest in lower prices for our customers. As you know fortunately, we generate a tremendous amount of free cash flow. We would expect over time for more of that growth to come from the business as opposed to buying back stock. And then once the merger happens, obviously, there's incremental accretion that will happen because of the merger for a period of time that once the merger happens, we'll give more insights into. Thank you. Yes. If you look at our Fresh trends overall, they would be stronger than the center store. Overall, I would say that we feel okay about where we are. But if you look, going forward, we continue to see improvement, and we would expect to see improvement throughout the balance of the year. So it's one of those areas where we're not satisfied. We are gaining strong household growth and strong loyal household growth as well, which also, in the past, always leads to future progress as well. So I would say that we feel okay where we are. We're more excited about what we see where the trends are and where we see for the balance of the year and next year because we're also incrementally adding storing [ph] as well, which helps on market share as well. Thanks Leah. Yeah, we are seeing progress on units. We would expect to continue to see progress on units. You didn't really ask, but if -- the thing that's right now, what we're seeing is, and I mentioned it earlier, in the first of the month, our business is really strong, holidays are strong. And then when you get to the end of the month, they're weaker because of the people being constrained on a budget. So far in the third quarter, we're tracking a little bit better than where we were in the second quarter. So fundamentally, we believe all the programs we're doing is making improved connection. Your question relative to 2025, I would say it's still early for us to start sharing guidance on 2025, and I would just -- the comments I made earlier about our long term business model really would apply to 2025. Obviously, we would expect to be in a position of where we've just completed a merger, and we would also need to update where we are relative to the merger and the integration of the merger and those factors as well. So thanks, Simeon, for the question. Before you move on, one additional shrink, Michael, that you might -- that everyone might find helpful is if you look at our Fresh side of our business, we've made meaningful progress on improving shrink over several quarters. Now when you look at the center store with organized retail crime and other things, you couldn't see it. But there's been tremendous changes by using technology, AI processes, and our teams have done a nice job of improving the Fresh side on shrink. That's not subject to as much theft, but it's really process-oriented. So now, Todd, I'll let you go and talk about some of the other stuff. Thanks Michael. Yes. As you've mentioned, I mean, you're always trying to balance all the pieces. Part of the PPI is it's -- certain parts of it are commodity-driven. And we will -- if we think something is a permanent cost increase then we try to pass that along as fast as we can. If it's a short-term blip, then we'll manage that based on what's going on in the market. And it's as difficult now estimating where inflation is going to be as probably any period of time, but we are seeing it being reasonably stable. If you look out in terms of price increases that CPGs have already shared with us because obviously, we'll see that in advance of it happening, it would certainly still be in the range of where we said we think overall inflation will be around 1%. And we don't see anything that's causing us to see that be much different than that. Over time, we do find the two kind of line up pretty close. The other thing that we are seeing is inflation on food away from home is meaningfully higher than food at home. And we are beginning to see customers move back from restaurants to food at home because you can prepare a meal at home for about a fourth of the cost of going out and getting a meal. So that is something that we are beginning to see a little bit of as well. I don't know, Todd, anything else you want to add on inflation? Good morning. And we're -- the money that we're investing, we're seeing good performance to budget as well. And operationally, it's a lot easier to open up a remodel or new store expansion earlier in the year versus later in the year as well. Yes. It's throughout the year, and as I mentioned before, we're seeing it more at the end of the month than the beginning of the month. And people continue to be aggressive or whatever the right term is on celebrating holidays. Now I think one of the things that's always important to remember is those changes aren't -- many of those changes are beneficial to us. So if you think about people moving from eating at a restaurant to cooking at home, that's beneficial for us. If we look at customers' changing segments, that's good for us because they typically will buy more Our Brands, products and they'll buy smaller packages and some of those things as well. So when we look, it's been really throughout. But I would say, over the last few months, it's been more pronounced as you get toward the end of the month. But all of those things are things that -- obviously, you're changing your promotional approach, your connection with the customers, what offers you make at different times of the month and all those things. So overall, the customer, as we've said all along, are under tremendous strain, especially customers on a budget. That was the reason why I want to say it was probably 1.5 years ago or 2 years ago, we saw that coming, and we introduced our Smart Way product to be much more aggressive on having an entry price point item because that was a trend that we saw coming and trying to be proactive on addressing that, and we continue to add product in that. But for us, we're going to do everything we can to help a customer be able to have a great meal without compromising and eating as a family. And so far, the changes the customer is experiencing, we're making changes to trying to support the customer and the customer is connecting well with that. So you feel for people in terms of where they are, and we're going to do everything we can to try to help support them on what their particular situation is. One other comment I would add to -- Robbie, to the OG&A comment that Todd was talking about is, we feel like we've developed a good skill on being able to identify cost reductions over time. And we would expect that's a skill that we'll have also as you look out in the second half and forward in next year as well. The other thing that our teams have done a nice job on is continuing to find process changes to be able to operate a store with less labor and simplify the store to run. And it's one of those where we've made good progress, but we still think we have plenty of opportunity to get better going forward. So I really appreciate the question. Good morning. Yeah, the increase in non-traditional competitors, obviously, has been a 20-year trend. And when you look at Amazon and Costco and Walmart and I could go on and on for the litany, those in terms of how do you be successful against them really is how do you continue to change your basic offering to the customer and supporting the customers' changes. And we felt good about those changes that we've made, but we still need to continue to make them. And it's one of those things where, if you ever think you've figured it out, it's -- I would say that it's not good, you need to change. So we feel good about our ability to compete. We'll have to continually change. It's the reason why we've invested so much in staying connected with the customer on a seamless perspective, continuing to invest in wages, continuing to invest in promotion, but making up some of those things with alternative profit growth and mix. And over time, we would hope food away -- a more stronger competitor on food away from home because half of the money that's spent on food is food away from home. And we see no reason why we shouldn't be able to get a share of that. If you look at the economic pressure so far, we feel confident in our ability to deal with it or manage it or whatever because there's -- fortunately, we have a large business, and there's a lot of moving parts. And Our Brands obviously had a strong quarter. We think the opportunity is even stronger in Our Brands and things like that, which helps support the customer that's under that economic pressure as well. So on those so far, I mean, if you had a depression, I wouldn't -- I would give a different answer. But so far on the things that we're seeing, we feel comfortable or confident in our ability to deal with those changes. Thanks Chuck. Good morning. Thanks, Alex and thank you to all for all your questions. And as you know, before we conclude our call, we always like to -- we have many of our associates listening in, and we always like to share a couple of comments with them. And I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our 2024 Kroger Scholars. Since the Kroger Scholars Program was launched in 2008, we've awarded more than 3,300 scholarships, totaling almost $5 million to children of our associates. These recipients were selected based on a broad range of criteria, including their volunteering activities, civic service, extracurricular activities, academic performance and work experience. And it's always fun to be able to help a little on their education and congratulations to our 120 winners this year. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. And I know it's early, but it will be December before we talk to everyone. I hope everyone has a beginning, great holiday season as well, and thank you very much."

            "name": "Todd Foley",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's second quarter results reflect the resilience of our model as investments made to diversify our business are enabling us to navigate an environment of economic uncertainty. Our results through the first half of the year are in line with our expectations, and with our improving sales momentum, we are able to reaffirm our full year guidance. I'll now take you through our second quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 1.2%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, identical sales were supported by several positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households and increased customer visits. We are encouraged by favorable unit trends as we continue to make progress toward achieving positive unit growth. As we saw in the first quarter, vendor support for promotions has been strong, and we will continue to deliver on our long term commitment of providing customers with exceptional value. Digital sales had a strong quarter, led by 17% growth in delivery solutions. Pickup is an important part of our seamless ecosystem and demand continues to be strong, with pickup sales growing 10%. This reflects our digital team's relentless focus on delivering a great customer experience, resulting in increased fill rates, a reduction in wait times and a 33% improvement in perfect orders, which are orders with both a 100% fill rate and that are completed within an appropriate wait time. With the help of AI-enabled advancements and dynamic batching and routing, we are able to offer two hour lead times and pickup in all stores. These improvements in customer experience are being accompanied by productivity enhancements, resulting in an improvement in our cost to serve. Turning to margins, I would like to spend a little more time today talking about our second quarter trends in gross margin and OG&A rates. As you know, our long term model is designed to deliver consistent year-over-year gross margin rate and OG&A rates in a way that we deliver slightly expanding operating margins over time. Though there can be puts and takes in these measures from quarter-to-quarter, over the long term, our business model gives us the flexibility to balance investments in lower prices and higher associate wages with growth in margins through Our Brands and alternative profit businesses as well as cost-saving initiatives and productivity, all to ensure that we are consistently returning value to shareholders. This expectation is true for fiscal 2024 as well. For the full year, we now expect FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, to be slightly positive, balanced by the OG&A rate without fuel, which will be slightly negative. This quarter, FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, was 42 basis points favorable to last year and was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Conversely, the OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, was 65 basis points unfavorable to last year as well as unfavorable to our expectations, primarily due to several nonrecurring charges during the quarter. Looking in more detail at our quarterly results, gross margin was 22.6% of sales. The increase in FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, was primarily attributable to favorable product mix in our grocery business, including Our Brands, lower shrink and sourcing benefits, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. The result reflected Kroger's ability to improve margin while being competitive on price and helping customers manage their budgets. The improvement in shrink reflects the significant ongoing work from our operations team as they address this challenging issue. While we are pleased with the result this quarter, shrink related to theft remains high on a historical basis, and we still have work to do to further mitigate the financial impact. The increase in OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, was driven by investments in associate wages, increased incentive plan costs and nonrecurring costs, including hurricane expenses and an increase in costs due to the severity of general liability claims, partially offset by continued execution of cost savings initiatives. During the second quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $21 million, compared to a charge of $4 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $984 million. Our adjusted EPS was $0.93 per diluted share, a decline of 3% compared to last year. Fuel is an important part of our total value proposition. It builds loyalty through our Kroger Plus program by offering customers another way to save and led to gallon sales outpacing the industry this quarter. Fuel profitability was stronger in the second quarter compared to last year on a cents per gallon basis. In the second half, we will be cycling stronger fuel results, but expect margins to be relatively flat compared to last year. I wanted to provide a brief update on inflation, a topic I am asked about frequently. Inflation increased slightly in the second quarter from the first quarter, but is trending around 1%, which is consistent with our expectations since the start of the year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for our Food 4 Less warehouse stores in Southern California, Columbus Valley stores, Mid-Atlantic Division stores, Anderson Bakery, Michigan, West Michigan and New Market clerks, Central Peoria clerks and Shelbyville warehouse, covering more than 13,000 associates. Kroger is working to reach an agreement with the UFCW for meat and grocery associates at 29 Fred Meyer stores in Portland. We respect our associates' right to collectively bargain. Associates at these stores chose to strike for six days before returning to work last week. Negotiations continue this week, and we remain open to constructive dialogue with the UFCW. We are also communicating to local unions. They are coming to the table with proposals that do not balance investing in associates, with keeping groceries affordable for our customers and supporting a growing and profitable business model are untenable. It underlines our goal of growing the company in a way that helps to ensure job security and create more jobs and advancement opportunities for more associates. Turning to cash flow, Kroger continues to generate strong adjusted free cash flow through consistent operating results. Consistent generation of free cash flow is an important part of our model and is enabling us to deleverage in anticipation of our merger with Albertsons. At the end of the second quarter, Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.24, compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides us flexibility to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for shareholders. We're committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time, subject to Board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. The strength of our free cash flow gives us the ability to invest in the growth of our business. We are allocating more capital to our major and minor store projects this year. Our teams have done an excellent job completing projects ahead of schedule. And year-to-date, we have completed almost double the amount of store projects as we had completed last year at this time, which will position us to grow in the second half of 2024 and 2025. It also creates capacity later this year to work towards opening 2025 projects earlier in the year as well. To reflect this, we are raising our guidance for full year capital expenditures from a range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Based on the strength of our free cash flow, the change to our CapEx guidance does not affect our adjusted free cash flow guidance. In the second quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend by 10%, reflecting confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow. Our quarterly dividend has grown at a 13.5% compounded annual growth rate since being reinstated in 2006, and this marked the 18th consecutive year of dividend increases. I'd now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. We are encouraged by our performance through the first half of the year, which led to results that were in line with expectations. Our solid sales results through the first two quarters of the year give us confidence to raise the low end of our full year identical sales without fuel guidance. We now expect identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.75% to 1.75%. We are cautiously optimistic about our sales outlook for the second half of the year and expect customers to continue prioritizing food and essentials. We have developed merchandising plans that are designed to enhance customer engagement, drive spending and improve unit volumes. The strength of our model enables us to navigate an environment where customer spending is constrained by current economic pressures, and we expect the various components of our model, including grocery, health and wellness, fuel and alternative profit businesses to provide us with flexibility in how we create shareholder value. As a result, we are reaffirming the rest of our full year guidance. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney. Yes. Be glad to, Kelly. Yes, you're right. As we went into the year, we talked about the expectations for our margins to be relatively flat. And included in that expectation was a little bit of an increase in the second quarter year-over-year. But even on top of that, some of the strength that we saw in Our Brands, like we called out, we had a tremendous quarter in Our Brands, actually, the sales growth there outpaced national brands quite meaningfully that helped drive it above our expectations. And also, we had a great shrink quarter. It's been a while since we've looked year-over-year on shrink and seen positive results. So that's really exciting to see as we called out. Still a lot of work to do there on a go-forward basis. So it was a little bit better than our expectations, which were to be up some, and therefore, for the balance of the year, we do expect for the full year margins to now be slightly favorable on a year-over-year basis. So from a digital profitability standpoint, Rodney, if you want to add anything in that space? Yeah. Great question. The things that you call out are great examples of some of the margin enhancement programs that we've talked about in the past as well as some of the productivity improvements and cost improvements that we've realized over time. That's an important part of our overall business model, being able to use that value that we create through the things that you called out to invest it back in the business. Rodney alluded to it. We have a long history of taking that value and reinvesting it back in the business in a way that over time, our operating profit rate grows slightly over time. So as we grow the top line, as we're able to balance the investments with the benefits that we get from those that drives the bottom line over time. Yes. Good question, Simeon. Let me start with the differences in comp. We did update our sales guidance for the year, taking up the bottom end of that range, as you saw from 25 basis points to 75 basis points, but kept the top end of the range at 1.75 basis points. And I think our thought process around that was really to take the low end off the table. If you think about where we came into the year, and there was quite a bit of disinflation last year. That was still kind of hitting us early in the year and wanted to make sure that we were navigating through that uncertainty. Our view at the time was that Q1 would be the low point of the year, and we would consistently grow our sales as we went through the year on a backdrop of inflation that was 1%-ish as we go throughout the year. And that's really -- certainly through the first half, it's played out as we expected in the first half of the year. And our expectations for the back half are very similar to the way that we thought about it back then. So I would say both our expectations on the sales and the inflation environment backdrop against which, it hasn't really changed a whole lot, and we expect that growth to flow. From a unit standpoint, we've talked about that a little bit. Rodney alluded to the fact we continue to be encouraged by the trends there. We're still a little negative on the unit side, but we continue to be encouraged by the progress that we're making in that space and think that will be part of the contribution to the sales trend that we see for the back half of the year. Yeah. We'll do, Michael. You're right. Great call out. And as we look at the back half of the year, we talked about, given the trends that we saw in the second quarter, our view for the year on gross margin would be that it will be slightly favorable year-over-year. And on OG&A, the annual trend will be slightly unfavorable year-over-year. But we do expect those to reasonably balance as they come out. We talked a little bit about shrink earlier. And again, we're really excited about the results that we saw in shrink, but I mentioned the caution that we have there. There is a lot of work to do. That issue is still out there. And our shrink costs are high relative to history on where we've been this. So our team continues to work in that space and continues to drive it. You can't have a trend until you have a data point. And so we're excited to see where we're at, but we're kind of cautiously optimistic about the opportunities for shrink for the balance of the year. Relative to some of the other costs-- Yes. Great color, I appreciate that. Talking a little bit on the cost side, there are -- we did see in the second quarter in part of why it was a little bit worse than our expectations, some non-recurring type of items. The main one was some costs related to Hurricane Beryl that came through. Obviously, that was event-driven relative to that. The second, and we've talked a little bit about this, we've talked about incentive being a little bit higher than our expectations. We do think for the second half of the year that will have less of an impact on our year-over-year OG&A than what we've seen in the past as well. So I think those are a couple of the examples of things that we don't expect to continue in the second half. I don't. Thanks, Rodney. Yes. Great color, Rupesh. On the CapEx, yes I think we talked about it. We've been working really hard to take the opportunity to get these storing projects open as quickly as we can to be able to serve customers. And so shifting spend from late in '24 to early in '24. You saw our CapEx year-to-date be a little bit higher. That's going to create some capacity to help us pull early -- what might have been early '25 construction process into late '24, so we can open next year's projects early too. So I think given the strong cash flow in the business, if we're able to continue to execute that, then I think what we'll see should be a lift in our spend in our capital plan over time. And then talking to your EPS comment, Rupesh, yes, for the balance of -- given where we landed in the first quarter in our actual results -- for the first half of the year, sorry, our first half kind of landed where we expected it to, quarter's played out a little bit differently than we thought. But the first half landed where we expected. And reaffirming the rest of the year, the back half, we think is right on par with where we've been guiding as well. Within that, we do think that the third quarter will be probably slightly ahead of where we were year-over-year and the fourth quarter probably slightly behind on a 52-week basis when you compare it 52 to 52, but that's probably how the trend will play out for the balance of the year. Yes. No, great call out. Relative to second half OG&A again, given what we saw in the second quarter, our guidance on the year is now we will be slightly unfavorable to where we were a year ago. But beyond that, I think our trends will be as expected in the second half of the year. You talk about wage pressure. One thing to keep in mind on our wage pressure is because so many of our wages come through collective bargaining agreements, we've got 300 or so of those. But at any point in time, probably 75% of our wages are locked in, in a collective bargaining agreement. We have maybe a third or a quarter of those that are up each year that we constantly negotiate. So the guidance that we have out there reflects those expectations and where we're at from a wage perspective because most of those are known to us going into the year. Your comment on GL claims, there's really two pieces to general liability. The incident rate piece is -- actually our results are phenomenal. When you look at it through the lens of OSHA incident rates, we're very much below where the industry averages are at. And even as a company where we're at, we're in that kind of record low territory there, at least in modern history. And so we're extremely excited about the work that the teams do to manage the incidents from that standpoint and the number of claims. What we saw as we were going through our analysis this time was around the average cost of the claim, and what we were seeing relative to the cost to settle some of these claims being much higher. Given the environment that's out there, we're seeing more and more pressure on the average cost to settle those claims. And so as we evaluated what we had outstanding for reserves in that space, given that trend, we thought it was wise to update it. We have done a nice job in the past trying to mitigating those claims and have a variety of strategies to put into place, and we'll continue to be able to put more of those types of items in place to be more effective in keeping that average cost down. But I think the announces that we did, I think, has us comfortable with where we need to be now and we don't expect that to recur in the back half of the year. Yes. Great question, Joe. And I think you hit on some of the keys. I think it's a variety of things. Inventory, it's -- part of it is we're seeing less cost inflation, so the average cost of an item on the shelf is a little bit less. But we have also been very laser-focused relative to working capital and working capital management. When we talk about our strong cash flow generation, that's an important part of that is balancing our working capital. And it's -- both of those go together. It's always having the right tension between making sure we're in stock for our customers and having what our customers need, but making sure we don't have too much there so that we're being a good steward of working capital. So I think what you're seeing on the balance sheet is the combination of lower cost per item, relative inflation year-over-year and the right level of working capital management to make sure we're in stock for our customers."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference call over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead.\nRob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's first quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.\nRodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our first quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the first quarter. Finally, I will provide a few comments on our proposed merger with Albertsons before we open it up for questions. We're off to a solid start in 2024, reflecting the strength and diversity of our model. As better than expected performance from our Grocery business helped us manage Fuel and Health & Wellness results that were behind expectations, Kroger is providing exceptional value and a unique omnichannel experience, which combined with strong store execution, led to growth in households and an increase in customer visits. As inflation moderates, we expect customer sentiment to continue improving. But near term, many customers are managing economic uncertainty. While we expect Health & Wellness profitability pressures to continue into the second quarter, our recent improvement on store execution metrics and strong customer trends give us confidence that we are building momentum for a strong back half of the year and we are well-positioned to deliver on our full-year guidance. As we've seen over recent quarters, customers continue to seek value and are shopping with us differently based on their financial situations. Spending from premium and mainstream customers continue to be strong. Mainstream households drove our overall household growth and we improved our share of wallet with premium customers who are deepening their loyalty, spending more in our fresh departments and enjoying more premium products such as Private Selection. Within our most budget-conscious households, we are starting to see positive momentum and we grew households in this segment after experiencing declines last year. Historic multi-year inflation across the economy, high interest rates and reduced government benefits disproportionately affect these customers and are influencing their spending behaviors. Kroger's longstanding commitment to low prices and personalized promotions creates real value for our customers at a time when many of them need it more than ever. Food-at-home continues to be the most affordable meal option for customers while food inflation has impacted every meal occasion, inflation in food-away-from-home has been even higher than food-at-home inflation since 2019. We are committed to making sure our customers can enjoy a great meal experience with zero compromise on quality, selection, value and convenience. We see a significant growth opportunity to deliver convenient restaurant quality meals at an attractive value and we are expanding our Ready To Heat and Ready To Eat offerings. For example, after we revamped our fried chicken recipe, we created a meal bundle which feeds a family for $3.50 a person, a fraction of what it would cost to eat out at restaurants with quality that's difficult to beat. Every day we strive to provide an outstanding customer experience and we are focused on sharpening our store execution to do just that. This year, we raised the bar on our full, fresh and friendly customer experience metrics and we are very proud of our store teams who are delivering an even better shopping experience with service metrics at record highs. To continue the momentum in our Grocery business, we are committed to keeping prices low for customers and delivering a consistent experience while growing our pillars of Fresh, Our Brands, Seamless and Personalization. Leading with Fresh, our store team's primary goal this year is to drive more consistent shopping experience and that begins with Fresh. We are introducing new technology that's enabling our teams to better track [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: We have lost connection with today's speaker. Please stand by while we still try to reconnect with them. Thank you for your patience, everyone. We now have the speaker back on the line. Please continue.\nRodney McMullen: Our ongoing work to differentiate and elevate our brands is driving higher profitability. We are identifying new supply sources using more effective promotions and improving product mix, which is contributing to further margin improvements. Now to Seamless. Delivery solutions led digital results again this quarter with an increase in both households and visits. Pickup also had solid growth and focus on delivering best-in-class fulfillment led to strong improvements in key customer experience metrics. This quarter, our teams improved fill rates to a new record high, reduced wait time and delivered a significant improvement in perfect orders compared to last year. Through the power of machine learning and AI, we are developing new ways to elevate the Pickup experience for customers and at the same time reduce costs. With dynamic batching of orders, these tools are providing associates the most effective pick routes, which is enabling us to dramatically reduce pick lead time in our highest volume stores. Our customers love the Kroger delivery experience with refrigerated products delivered directly to their doorstep. As a result, the Kroger delivery network has experienced remarkable growth with sales nearly doubling this quarter versus last year. As we focus on providing an incredible customer experience, we are learning and adjusting the delivery network. A good example of this is our decision in the first quarter to close three spoke locations to reallocate capacity closer to our automated fulfillment centers where we have higher customer density and better order level profitability. This decision does not impact Kroger's automated FCs or other spoke locations. We remain confident that our Kroger delivery network provides a differentiated customer experience and will continue to be a key pillar of our digital growth strategy. Turning to Personalization. The combination of seamless and our personalization capabilities generated another quarter of digital engagement growth, up 9% compared to the same quarter last year. Personalization enables us to balance the depth and breadth of our promotions more effectively and encourages customers to engage more with us by focusing on promotions that matter most to them. This led to an 18% increase in digital coupon clips compared to last year. Capturing more digital households is a key to our long-term growth model as these households are more loyal, spend nearly three times as much with us and drive our alternative profit businesses. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we create momentum in our Grocery business. In turn, this creates the data and traffic to accelerate growth in areas like Health & Wellness and our Alternative Profit businesses. Alternative Profit businesses had a strong quarter led by growth in Kroger Precision Marketing. KPM results were in-line with what we expected and keep us on track to meet our full-year expectations of more than 20% media growth. Yesterday, KPM continued to broaden its reach by offering its custom audiences and ad measurement capabilities to advertisers on the Meta social media platforms. This is another important step in KPM's growth, creating more opportunities for clients to reach relevant audiences in more places and providing better transparency to add effectiveness. Health & Wellness grew its top line this quarter. However, profitability results were below expectations. We are optimistic about the potential of this area of our business. Our script adherence initiatives are on track and our teams are providing excellent care which helps patients live healthier lives. Additionally, our marketing plans and in-store activations designed to raise awareness and attract new patients are launching now to help drive growth in the back half of the year. Turning now to associates. Our associates are doing an excellent job elevating the customer experience and improving our full, fresh and friendly metrics this quarter. Team consistency leads to better execution and retention improved again this quarter. We are retaining more associates through a holistic approach which includes wage and benefit investments and also a focus on associates well-being and this work is being recognized. This quarter, Kroger received the 2024 Platinum Bell Seal for Workplace Mental Health. This is the third consecutive year that we've been recognized with the certification. And for the first time we received the top distinction. This program recognized Kroger as an employer who creates a mentally healthy workplace for our associates through culture, benefits, compliance and wellness programs. We'll continue to invest in our associates. When our associates have a better experience, they provide a better experience to our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Todd to take you through our first quarter financial results. Todd?\nTodd Foley: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's first quarter performance reflects the resiliency of our model, which enables us to manage a variety of economic cycles. The strength of our model combined with the momentum in our Grocery business gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance even as we continue to navigate an environment of economic uncertainty. I'll now take you through our first quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 0.5%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our identical sales were driven by several positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households and increased customer visits. We continue to see sequential unit improvement and our teams remain focused on returning to positive units later this year. Inflation continues to moderate, which is consistent with our expectations at the start of the year, and towards the end of the first quarter, we began cycling the headwinds from the reduction in SNAP benefits. Digital sales grew by more than 8%, which was led by 17% growth in delivery solutions. Gross margin was 22.4% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased seven basis points. The decrease in rate was primarily attributable to lower pharmacy margins and increased price investments partially offset by favorable product mix reflecting Our Brands' margin performance. The slight decline in our FIFO gross margin rate was in line with our expectations. We expect our FIFO gross margin rate to improve beyond our first quarter result driven by the core components of our margin expansion initiatives. During the first quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $41 million compared to a charge of $99 million for the same quarter last year. The decreased charge for the quarter was due to lower inflation expectations for the current year compared to last year. The OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items increased 22 basis points, driven by planned investments in associate wages and increased incentive plan costs partially offset by continued execution of cost savings initiatives. In the second quarter, we expect the factors identified in the first quarter to continue, leading to a similar to slightly higher OG&A rate. We expect our OG&A rate to improve in the second half of 2024. We continue to make progress on our digital profitability, delivering another quarter of improvement in our pickup cost to serve. It remains a long-term margin opportunity with runway to improve through increased volume and process enhancements. Our store associates played a key role in the cost to serve improvements and, as Rodney mentioned earlier, did so while they improved key customer experience metrics. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.499 billion. Our adjusted EPS was $1.43 per diluted share, a decline of $0.05 compared to last year. Fuel continues to be a key driver of our strategy to build loyalty by providing compelling fuel rewards to customers. We continue to see more reward activity with 8% more redemptions contributing to gallon sales, which outpaced the industry this quarter. However, our fuel profitability was below expectations this quarter with our cents per gallon fuel margin down low single-digits compared to last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. We continue to invest in our associates as part of our long-term strategy, resulting in an average hourly rate of $19 an hour and a rate of nearly $25, with comprehensive benefits factored in. During the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for our Houston Clerks and Meat, Mid-Atlantic Division stores in West Virginia, South Carolina stores in Columbia and Myrtle Beach and Portland Distribution Center and Drivers covering more than 21,000 associates. Turning to cash flow. Kroger continues to generate adjusted free cash flow, strong adjusted free cash flow, through consistent operating results which is enabling us to continue deleveraging in anticipation of our merger with Albertsons. At the end of the quarter, Kroger's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.25 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides ample opportunities for Kroger to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on projects which drive long-term sustainable net earnings growth while remaining committed to our investment grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time subject to board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. As part of our capital investment plans for 2024, we shared last quarter our plans for approximately 30 major storing projects focused on higher growth geographies, where we have traditionally achieved a strong ROIC and operating profit growth. We've made good progress on our projects so far and remain on track with our plans. While early, we're happy with the results from projects completed in the first quarter. We are confident these new storing projects will help advance our omnichannel strategy and be an important component to our sales growth and TSR model going forward. During the first quarter, we announced we had entered an agreement for the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business. As part of our regular and ongoing review of our portfolio, we determined that Specialty Pharmacy was not part of our core strategy going forward and a sale would enable us to focus on our Health & Wellness strategies that revolve around our retail pharmacies. Due to the sale, a non-recurring held for sale tax adjustment of $31 million was recognized in the quarter and it has been reflected as an adjustment item in our results. The sale of KSP is not expected to have an impact on our 2024 guidance. I'd now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. Today, we reaffirmed our annual guidance reflecting both positive momentum we are seeing in our business along with a more cautious customer environment in the near term. In terms of quarterly cadence, we now expect a decline in adjusted EPS for the second quarter similar to the rate we observed in the first quarter as we expect pharmacy business profitability pressures to carry over into the second quarter. This reaffirms where we expected to be through both the first half of the year as well as the full fiscal 2024. In closing, our first quarter performance reflects the strength and resiliency of our model. We are strengthening our Grocery business, which drives the data and traffic to accelerate growth in our Alternative Profit businesses and we remain confident in our ability to drive attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks, Todd. As you've heard from both of us, our Grocery business is performing well and we are building momentum across our business. Kroger is operating from a position of strength. We have the right strategy, which is resonating with customers, and we have the financial strength to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. As we continue to prepare for our merger with Albertsons, I'd like to thank our associates for their incredible commitment. Since we announced the proposed merger back in October of 2022, our associates have done an exceptional job preparing for the integration with Albertsons while never once taking their eye off the ball of serving our customers, advancing our strategy, operating our business and driving results. Because of their efforts, we will be prepared to hit the ground running as a combined company ready to serve more customers from day one. A more general merger update, in April, we announced an expanded divestiture plan with C&S, which directly responds to the concerns raised by federal and state antitrust regulators regarding the original agreement. We believe the package, which includes a modified and expanded store set and more non-store assets, bolsters Kroger's position and regulatory challenges to the proposed merger. Including our upcoming court proceedings, it also positions C&S to be a strong and successful competitor. We are prepared to defend our merger because it will produce meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, for associates and for communities across the country. Customers will benefit from lower prices and more choices following the merger close. We have committed to investing $500 million to begin lowering prices day one following close, along with an additional $1.3 billion to improve Albertsons stores. Employees will benefit from Kroger's commitment to invest $1 billion to raise wages and comprehensive benefits, further building on our $2.4 billion and incremental investments since 2018. As union membership continues to decline nationwide, this merger will secure union jobs. And communities will benefit from the strength and the ability of the combined company to accelerate Kroger's commitment to ending hunger. As a combined company, Kroger has committed to donating 10 billion meals to families across the US by 2030. In closing, Kroger is off to a solid start to the year, positioning us well to deliver on our commitments. We continue to invest in associates and the associate experience because when they have a better experience, our customers do as well. Grocery results are off to a better-than-expected start, which provides the foundation for growth in Alternative Profit businesses and our model is generating strong free cash flow, which has strengthened our balance sheet and positions us for future growth. With that Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nRupesh Parikh: So I wanted to dig deeper into the gross margin line, if you can maybe walk us through the puts and takes as you guys see it for the balance of the year, including how you think about the pharmacy margins in the back half of the year.\nTodd Foley: Yeah, thanks, Rupesh. Great question. We talked at the beginning of the year that our expectation was to have relatively flat year-over-year gross margin and that is still the expectation. As mentioned in my comments, we do expect results for the balance of the year to improve beyond our Q1 results and that's really reflective of some of the gross margin expansion efforts that we have going on. They're going actually really well. We alluded to our Our Brands performance. Our margins in Our Brands continue to do very well and as that business continues to grow, particularly in today's environment, we talked about the budget-conscious consumer and that continues to connect with them. And so the growth in that business helps drive the margins and we expect to see that as the year goes on. Fresh is another category where we've had meaningful growth. Fresh is doing really well. We've talked a lot about produce, our end-to-end Fresh and how that business is growing. And certainly that comes with higher margins, which has a positive effect on our mix. And then when you look at Alternative Profits and in particular retail media, that business continues to grow well and especially the second half of the year. We expect retail media to continue its momentum to achieve our growth of excess of 20% for the year. A lot going on in that space. And we went to a new platform a year ago and as we went and ramped up the platform a year ago, we'll be cycling that period of time with some of the momentum we have in that business. So all of those are where a lot of our confidence comes from when we talk about reaffirming our guidance for the year. And we alluded to some of the pharmacy headwinds. Even though we expect some of those to carry over into the second quarter, I think all of the results that we're seeing from our margin expansion efforts are going to continue to drive us so that we hit our expectations to improve the result relative to Q1.\nRodney McMullen: I want to just add a couple of points on Todd's last point. We continue to have good success with value-add product and typically that product is something that the customer can eat almost immediately in the car or at home, and that's helping on margin. And then our sourcing teams continue to have making progress in cost of goods, which helps as well.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up question. In light of some of the competitor announcements of reducing price on certain items, just wondering how you guys feel about your price gaps today.\nRodney McMullen: If you look at overall, as you know, for the last, I don't know, 15, 18 years, part of the Kroger's strategy has always been to invest in pricing every year and 2024 wouldn't have been any different than any of the previous years. And we continue to execute against that plan of helping the customer stretch their budget. If you look at where we feel on our relative price position, we feel very good. And one of the things that we even -- was glad to see is if you look at the customer that's on a budget, for the first time in over a year, we actually had growth in count from that customer base. So overall, we feel good about where we are. One of the things I always think it's important to remember too is, as a promotional merchant, people buy a lot more when things are in promotion. We also have a very sophisticated rewards program for personalized offers that publicly you wouldn't see and also our fuel rewards. So overall, we feel good about where we are and we feel good about where we are relative to any of our competitors. Thanks, Rupesh.\nRupesh Parikh: Great, thank you. I'll pass it along.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert F. Ohmes from Bank of America Meryll Lynch.\nRobert Ohmes: Oh, hey, Rodney. I had just two follow-ups on the first question. Hey, just in terms of the price investments, and I know you guys always do them, but has anything changed with what your CPG partners are doing with Kroger to drive volumes? Because we know that they're looking to do that. And then also would love to just get further perspective on what Kroger is seeing competitively either the same or different sort of there's kind of Walmart and Target, but what are the regionals and independents doing competitively? Are they changing at all? What they're doing?\nRodney McMullen: If you look at CPG partners, overall, we would be seeing more trade dollars than in the past, and I think some of that ties to the comment I made before on sourcing. As economists always say, all short statements are incorrect. There are some CPG partners that aren't worried as much about tonnage and wouldn't be as aggressive. But we are seeing an increased trend where CPG most CPG partners are starting to focus on tonnage again and then trying to partner with us more aggressively to help tonnage. If you look at regional competitors, really wouldn't see much difference there than the national competitors. And overall inflation is up slightly. You would see people raising slightly more prices than lowering. But nothing that's especially different there than what we would see. And as you know, there's a ton of great awesome regional competitors out there. Thanks, Robby.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.\nUriel Zachary Abraham: Hi. This is Zach on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our questions. First, with respect to the Q1 performance, would you say that you set up the guidance with some conservatism or was it genuinely stronger than what you thought it would look like? And maybe as a follow-up, why shouldn't we extrapolate that level of upside for the full year? And was it driven primarily by price or units or some of both? Thank you.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah, if you look at the first quarter performance, as Todd and I both mentioned, we felt very good about where we were finished or where it turned out. One of the things I always think it's, the first quarter is so early in the year, I never felt -- it would be unusual for us to feel comfortable changing too much. If you look at things that we felt good about or the things that we outlined in the prepared comments around our customer count growth, the growth that's broad-based across all of our customer types, our store team is doing a very good job of continuing to improve the experience and in-stock positions and all those things. The couple of headwinds that we do have is if you look at like incentive plans, especially in the second quarter, we'll have significantly higher incentive plan accruals in the second quarter than what we did a year ago, which is partially what's affecting the second quarter. But overall, for the year, we feel good about where we are. We feel good about where we are relative to where we thought we would be. But it's really too early in the year to make too many changes.\nTodd Foley: That's a good call, Rodney. And actually the two go together. The strength we saw in the first half of the business is really tied to your incentive plan comment. A big contributor to the strength we're seeing in our Grocery business is around our teams delivering on store execution and the shopping experience and improvement in those metrics is an important part of our incentive plan this year. So it's -- those two thoughts are connected with one another.\nUriel Zachary Abraham: Okay.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks, Zach.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kenneth B. Goldman from JPMorgan.\nKenneth Goldman: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, are you still on track to see inflation increase as the year progresses? I think that was mentioned in the last quarter. I didn't hear any update on that rate of change. And then I don't think you provided, again, I may have missed it, gross profit dollars or pennies per gallon for fuel. Just trying to follow up on those two.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah, I'll let Todd answer the second part. On inflation for the year, the first quarter was pretty much where we expected it to be. Where we, for the year, it's pretty consistent with where we thought it would be. So if I'm going off of memory, but I think we said it was slightly over 1% and we would continue to see it slightly over 1%. It's -- if you look at some of the commodity -- the commodities themselves, obviously that will bounce up and down. And as you get later in the year, we -- that some of that bounce will be driven by what kind of crop year is it relative to corn and some of those things. But really overall, what we expect inflation to be similar to where we did last year and it is starting to stabilize. We don't see deflation broad-based at all, but it is stabilizing around that little over 1%.\nTodd Foley: Yeah, that's great. And on the fuel point, we did -- in my comments that we did see that cents per gallon margin was down low single digits.\nRodney McMullen: Okay. Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Partners.\nJohn Heinbockel: Hey, Rodney, I wanted to start with, when you think about delivery and pickup profitability, I mean, I know you're losing money in those areas. Do you have an idea in mind when you can begin to approach breakeven? I know it's going to take a while, but thought on that. And then if you had to pick a couple of key drivers, right, that would get you there, what do you think they are?\nRodney McMullen: Yeah, if you look, and John, we've talked about it a lot of times, I always say our job one is to make sure we don't lose the customer and job two is we have the responsibility to figure out how to be profitable with each of those customers. We do have some divisions that are now at breakeven or slightly profitable. And if you look at incrementally on a per order basis, through almost all of our channels, now they're -- incrementally they're contributing. In terms of our expectation of ourself is that, that customer will be just as profitable as a store customer over time. I don't know that I would put a specific date on it yet, but that is the expectations we have for ourselves. And the key things on it will be continuing, for me, I think number one is making sure our NPS scores stay strong because that's what causes that customer to continue to repeat. Then making sure that each basket we start getting where the customer adds items within a basket and then always from an operating cost standpoint, we'll continue to use our technology to be more efficient.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Then maybe as a follow-up on pharmacy. So what's your sense -- the pressure is coming from where? Is it solely reimbursement or something else? I mean what's your take on reimbursement longer term and are we basically going to see less capacity, right? Drugstores, right, are closing a lot of locations. But do you think between that, supermarkets getting out of the business, there will be a lot less capacity in Pharmacy three years or four years or five years from now that will help profitability?\nTodd Foley: John, I'll talk to the headwinds a little bit. What we're seeing there was really a couple of items in product mix. One was around GLP-1. We've talked about that before. It's a high retail ring, but an extremely low margin and so that puts pressure on our margins. And coming into the year, if you recall the latter part of last year, we had supply constraints on GLP-1. And so some of those restraints were relieved in the first quarter. And frankly, our team did a really nice job with suppliers getting out there to get product to meet demand in our stores. And so our sales exceeded what we expected to see in the first quarter and that put a little bit of that unexpected pressure on margins. And then the second, there's another category of drugs as well, where we saw some regulatory restrictions that were unexpected that drove up the cost on those meds and put some pressure on the margin. So when we talked about some unexpected trends in Pharmacy, it was really around product mix in those couple of areas, and wanted to make sure we called it out, because we do see that carrying over into the second part of the year, it wasn't necessarily reimbursement related.\nRodney McMullen: And as we look longer term, three years or five years, we definitely think there'll be less capacity. And as you noted, there's a significant number of closures by the other three players in that space. And there's a lot of work that's being done from a governmental standpoint around PBMs. The thing that I get super excited about, our pharmacies and our Health & Wellness teams, they continue to do a great job of improving the experience. And I think it's amazing that a third of our customers don't even realize we have a pharmacy. And we're obviously working incredibly hard to make sure that third of our customers that don't even realize we have a custom that we have a pharmacy to get them to convert and become a patient of our pharmacy because our teams do an amazing job on service. We have incredibly quick lines and things like that and it's one less trip that somebody has to make. So thanks, John, for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nMichael Lasser: Rodney, between some of the comments from other food -- morning -- before -- between some of the comments from other food retailers, as well as your own discussion around increased price investments, there is a perception that the industry is becoming more competitive and that is going to disrupt the profitability of food retail in the back half of the year. So could you compare where the overall promotional intensity that you're witnessing is today versus where it's been in the past, especially around disruptive times? And how much did your price investment contribute to the improvement that you saw in more price-sensitive customers, lower income consumers, in the quarter?\nRodney McMullen: In terms of overall, I would say, in terms of promotional activity looks very similar to pre-COVID and for the first time it finally starts looking and feeling more like pre-COVID times. As I mentioned a second ago, overall, we saw more prices go up than go down, when you look at the individual number of SKUs. I feel really good about where we are and I feel good about our teams and their ability to continue taking care of customers. In terms of the valued customer, I think, a lot of it is driven more from some of the things that we've done relative to our new brand in terms of Smart Way, helping that customer understand that they can come and shop with us and it's -- and you don't have to compromise relative to fresh and quality and some of those other aspects and experience -- the customer experience or associate experience that they give. So when you look at it overall, it's pretty consistent with where we thought it would be. And part of it, I think, is just the moderating inflation, but we still continue to expect a little bit of inflation.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is that Kroger's financial formula works very well when its ID sales are above 3%. When is a realistic expectation that it could resume seeing ID sales back at that level?\nTodd Foley: I think you're right. Our model is to drive 2% to 4% ID sales. And as you looked at -- we talked a lot last quarter around the dynamics of inflation and what we saw last year with the rapid disinflation throughout the year. And as we get back to this year, that more normal inflation environment that Rodney alluded to, and we start cycling those heavy disinflations. We talk about the -- getting towards the high end of our guidance range relative to sales by the second half of the year and I think that starts to get us back into that range that our long-term model is based on in the 2% to 4%.\nRodney McMullen: And the other thing, it's a great question. It's hard to give a specific data other than I can assure you that our team is working really hard to get there. We're also -- and this is something I would say we've always done, but you always try to get better. And if you look at capital investments, we would also be using capital investments to support that growth. And as you know, we're starting to increase the number of stores that we're opening. And the maturity of those stores and the remodel of those stores also help with identicals over time. And we would expect that to obviously be the case now. And as Todd mentioned, it's early in the slightly higher capital spending for new stores and expansions and stuff, but we're pleased with the early results. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore.\nMichael Montani: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask if you could discuss the ID sales cadence through the quarter and then in the month of June. How should we think about ID sales for 2Q? And then I had a follow-up.\nTodd Foley: Yeah, the first quarter was a little choppy because we had a Easter mismatch relative to the calendar. But the general trend throughout the quarter was that we saw IDs increase steadily as we went through the quarter on average. And then as we look to Q2 to date, so far, we're right on plan relative to our expectations for Q2 results in the guidance that we've given.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah, and as you know, we do expect IDs to improve throughout the year and we continue -- so far we're continuing to see that and would expect that to continue.\nMichael Montani: Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just wanted to try to better get the arms around some of the pharmacy pressures, is there anything that you could point to in the back half of the year, whether it be comparison-based or otherwise, that would help to alleviate some of those pressures or perhaps other sources of profit, whether it be media or fuel that could offset somewhat?\nRodney McMullen: I'll make a couple of comments, and Todd, feel free to add. One of the things as you get to the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter is vaccines. And as you know, last year our teams did an amazing job of increasing the number of vaccines we gave. And we have a ton of learnings that we think will be able to do that again this year. And the -- so when you look at just the pharmacy business, part of that will be that. And also on some of the supply issues, we would hope that and expect for those to get more normalized and like the one drug that Todd was talking about, the generics, as they come out and stuff, historically, that's always improved profitability. And we would expect at some point in this latter part of the year for those things to happen. Relative to the other pieces, Todd, I'll let you.\nTodd Foley: You're right on with what I was going to say on pharmacy, Rodney, and just overall with the business. I alluded to earlier, the margin expansion efforts that we're seeing, and those are all factored into the guidance for the rest of the year. And even given those pharmacy headwinds, we expect the pharmacy or the margin expansion, the gross margin expansion initiatives that we have blended with the pharmacy headwinds that we called out should enable us to achieve gross profit results beyond what we saw in the first quarter.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ed Kelly from Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nEdward Kelly: I wanted to start two questions. The first question I had is just around -- good morning -- it's just around the second quarter guidance. So in Q1, you beat on lower fuel margins and lower pharmacy. Q2, the guidance is coming down. Is that just solely based on pharmacy and incentive comp? Is there something else happening within here? I'm just trying to figure out the level of conservatism that is sitting in the second quarter guidance given what you just did in Q2 against all of this.\nTodd Foley: Yeah, no, you're right. And it is primarily based on pharmacy and incentive. You are correct. From a fuel perspective, that's so volatile. It's really week to week. It's part of what we keep our eye on as we go forward. So far it has been closer to our expectations for the quarter, but that's one that we truly monitor daily and weekly to understand the impact it's having on the business.\nEdward Kelly: All right. Then I guess a quick follow-up is just on leverage. So you continue to reiterate your leverage target. You are well below that at this point. Taking a step back, are there any advantages that you see to the business to running below the target long-term? Is this a metric that you think you would reassess post the Albertsons decision? Just curious as to how you're thinking about that.\nTodd Foley: I think long-term, our targets at 2.3 to 2.5 are in the right place. That is -- one of our key objectives is to maintain our investment grade rating and over time, it's proven that is the range that enables us to be able to do that. So I think we long-term continue to look to operate within that range, with or without the merger, frankly. And the beauty with where we're at here, you're right, we do have a lot of capacity there. Obviously, we're firmly focused on closing the merger and being able to use that capacity relative to the merger and come out the other end. But I think in any scenario, the capital allocation approach that we've taken over time, we've got a long track record on what that is and how we do it. And I would expect this to execute under that framework on a go-forward basis.\nRodney McMullen: We really view our lowest cost of capital is a BBB rating. And if you look at it historically, it's like 80% of the time that would be the lowest cost of capital. And as you look at the markets going forward, we don't see anything that would cause that to change. So that gives you the financial flexibility to do things like merging with Albertsons. It also creates the lowest cost of capital. And the reason we always reiterate that 2.3 to 2.5 is that really is the point that we believe creates a solid BBB rating. And the thing that, as Todd and I both mentioned, the business continues to be incredibly strong from a free cash flow standpoint and the anticipation going forward. So it gives us the opportunity to continue to invest in the business, continue to grow the business, and we can't wait to be able to merge with Albertsons, so we can do that at even a scale a little bit bigger. So thanks, Ed, for the questions.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO.\nKelly Bania: Hi. Good morning. This is Kelly Bania from BMO.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nKelly Bania: Just wanted to ask about the volume and the tonnage outlook. I think you mentioned some positive momentum with the budget consumers and maybe an increasing customer count there. But how are volumes and tonnage trending year-over-year within your different customer cohorts? And how is that impacting your outlook for the full year in terms of tonnage and volume overall?\nRodney McMullen: If you look, the tonnage trends are all trying to think if there's any exception to this, they're all in the right direction and they're improving. If you look at historically, part of that, we believe, is because of the moderating inflation, part of it is because of doing a better job on in-stock and the customer experience and connecting better with each customer segment. So we feel good about those trends for multiple of reasons. Was there a follow-up question or?\nKelly Bania: Oh, yeah, thank you. I wasn't sure if you're done. Just wanted to ask maybe another question on the promotional and the competitive environment. It sounds like you characterize it maybe back to normal, I guess. What's different today about Kroger's kind of gross margin profile being more stable? And it sounds like maybe up a little bit in the next couple of quarters here relative to a few years ago, how much of that just rests on the Alternative Profit and the magnitude of that and the growth -- continued growth there versus anything different that you see in the gross margin for the kind of the core business?\nTodd Foley: Yeah, Kelly, I think it's -- you hit on part of it. I don't think it's just Alternative Profit. I think we have today more levers maybe than we've had in the past to be able to drive that value through margin expansion. So it's Alternative Profit and retail media. It's what our merchants do. We've already talked a little bit today about our brands and the value that our brand brings and the margin expansion there. And same with Fresh. I think it's all of those areas. And I think it's also the things that we continue to do with process improvement, whether it's in supply chain, whether it's continuing to drive down shrink, et cetera, et cetera. So I think it's the variety of margin improvement initiatives that we have. It is -- it's what's a little different than maybe what we saw several years ago, because we have various sources of value to help fund those investments in our customers and in our associates frankly.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah. And if you look at some of the things that's in margin, like, warehouse and transportation costs, our teams are making good progress there, reducing the number of empty miles, taking and managing more of the transportation. So there's a lot -- one of the things, as you know, we've done a ton of work over the last five years or 10 years on diversifying our business model and how we create value. And part of it is the traffic that our base business creates being able to monetize that in ways that the customer actually views and finds of value. Thanks, Kelly.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Krisztina Katai from Deutsche Bank.\nKrisztina Katai: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the store execution plan that you implemented with the daily scoring system. Now you're really addressing some of the underperforming stores relative to the chain average. So one is what has been the biggest opportunity for some of the store-level improvements you're seeing? Just how much are they contributing to the traffic gains that you are also seeing? And just how best to think about further upside with both your budget-conscious customers but also the mainstream and the premium customers?\nRodney McMullen: When you look at upside, I think, our whole team feels incredibly good. If you were in one of our meetings, you would hear us talk about all the things that we can get better at, and it's things that matter to our associates and matter to our customers. So we're incredibly excited about the continued opportunity we have on getting better. On the store execution, obviously, they always say retail is detail and it literally is working with every single store. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, turnover continue to improve. When turnover is lower, when retention is better, it helps on the experience, it helps on the execution in the store, on in-stocks and other things. Our teams are doing a very good job on Fresh and that's everything from our supply chain to our folks ordering product to using AI to make sure the right stores get the right product, to the stores getting it out on the shelf and helping the customer have a couple more days of freshness at home. So it's really all of those things together that we think it's what's driving the increased traffic and increased in connection with our customers. So it's obviously super proud of the whole team and excited about the opportunities going in front of us.\nKrisztina Katai: Great. And just a quick follow-up. I hate to beat this, but just on the promo backdrop, just how should we think about your promotional basket? How much of that is proactive versus reactive that you are doing in the current environment? And I think you said that it's pretty much back to pre-COVID levels. Is it fair to assume that your vendor funding is also in line with pre-COVID levels or do you anticipate that to continue to ramp as your vendors are focusing on driving volumes? Thank you.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look at vendor funding, we would expect it to continue to increase because you know that CPGs are trying to move tonnage. If you look at overall, we would, I think, feel like it's pretty much backed up pre-COVID but at a higher level. Some CPGs have increased their margins without, so they're just making flat-out more profit. So we think they actually have room to even further invest in trade dollars.\nTodd Foley: To your comment on reactive versus proactive, when we put our plan together for the year and our guidance in the whole nine yards, we put together our pricing strategy for the year and we're executing on the strategy that we've put in place and we think clearly customers are responding to that very favorably. We're not deviating from the plan that we have -- that we've put into place. We're executing our playbook. Rodney mentioned it earlier. It's what we've done for 15 years or 20 years and we've stuck to our playbook and we think that's what's resonating with our customers.\nRodney McMullen: Yeah, there isn't things that are going on out there that I would say that's causing us to be reactive. You always pay attention and I spend as much time getting to the competitors' store as I do our own stores. But when I look at overall, we're running our plan and we're using our data and insights to make sure that we're taking care of our customers and associates. So I feel really good about where we are overall on that. So thanks for the questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research.\nChuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning, Chuck.\nChuck Cerankosky: I was cut off for a while, but it sounded like you said, Rodney, that your delivery sales doubled year-over-year in the first quarter. What's driving that? Is it just your execution or the customer demand? And when you look at customer demand for delivered groceries, how does it break down between budget-conscious customers and more affluent customers?\nRodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look, sorry that you got cut off, but the delivery business almost doubled year-on-year. It's pretty broad based on all customer segments, but I think one of the things that's important to remember is that our technology allows us to do a better job now accepting SNAP and some of those things than what it did a year ago. So it's really across all customers. I think the thing that's driving it is our teams are doing a nice job on making sure the experience is good. I can tell you in Florida, people get ice cream that's still frozen and chocolate that's not melted because of our delivery, because of the delivery trucks. And it's really -- it's one of those things where all the things you feel good about, we still have a lot of work to make sure that we're satisfied with the profitability.\nChuck Cerankosky: Are there any CPG promotions or monies made available to help get that customer to make the first delivery order?\nRodney McMullen: Yes. The short answer is yes. And there's, as you know, online and with our data and personalization, there's all kinds of things that you're learning in terms of different customers find it attractive at different times. So the short answer is absolutely yes. The other thing is, obviously online really supports the Alternative Profit business as well from a media standpoint. Thanks, Chuck.\nChuck Cerankosky: Thanks, Rodney. Good luck for the rest of the year.\nRodney McMullen: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The question-and-answer session is now finished. So I will hand back over to Rodney for any final remarks.\nRodney McMullen: Thank you for all the questions, as always. As you know, I always like to share a few comments with our associates listening in. Today I'd like to take a moment to celebrate Alex Spurlock. Alex is a store leader at QFC store 860 in Redmond, Washington, and recently was named the 2024 Food Industry Association Store Leader of the Year. Obviously, this is a huge honor and we are so impressed by the amazing work that Alex does at her store. With more than a decade in the grocery business, Alex understands the industry. She has a gentle spirit and a fierce attention to detail that clearly earned her this recognition. What's most impressive is Alex's passion for her associates. She is always ready to coach her team and celebrate their success in meaningful ways. Thank you and congratulations, Alex, for everything you do for our customers and your fellow associates. And congratulations on this amazing honor. And thank you to all of our teams for all the work they do every day to take care of each other and our associates and thank you for everyone for joining us today.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference call. Have a nice day. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rodney McMullen",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our first quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the first quarter. Finally, I will provide a few comments on our proposed merger with Albertsons before we open it up for questions. We're off to a solid start in 2024, reflecting the strength and diversity of our model. As better than expected performance from our Grocery business helped us manage Fuel and Health & Wellness results that were behind expectations, Kroger is providing exceptional value and a unique omnichannel experience, which combined with strong store execution, led to growth in households and an increase in customer visits. As inflation moderates, we expect customer sentiment to continue improving. But near term, many customers are managing economic uncertainty. While we expect Health & Wellness profitability pressures to continue into the second quarter, our recent improvement on store execution metrics and strong customer trends give us confidence that we are building momentum for a strong back half of the year and we are well-positioned to deliver on our full-year guidance. As we've seen over recent quarters, customers continue to seek value and are shopping with us differently based on their financial situations. Spending from premium and mainstream customers continue to be strong. Mainstream households drove our overall household growth and we improved our share of wallet with premium customers who are deepening their loyalty, spending more in our fresh departments and enjoying more premium products such as Private Selection. Within our most budget-conscious households, we are starting to see positive momentum and we grew households in this segment after experiencing declines last year. Historic multi-year inflation across the economy, high interest rates and reduced government benefits disproportionately affect these customers and are influencing their spending behaviors. Kroger's longstanding commitment to low prices and personalized promotions creates real value for our customers at a time when many of them need it more than ever. Food-at-home continues to be the most affordable meal option for customers while food inflation has impacted every meal occasion, inflation in food-away-from-home has been even higher than food-at-home inflation since 2019. We are committed to making sure our customers can enjoy a great meal experience with zero compromise on quality, selection, value and convenience. We see a significant growth opportunity to deliver convenient restaurant quality meals at an attractive value and we are expanding our Ready To Heat and Ready To Eat offerings. For example, after we revamped our fried chicken recipe, we created a meal bundle which feeds a family for $3.50 a person, a fraction of what it would cost to eat out at restaurants with quality that's difficult to beat. Every day we strive to provide an outstanding customer experience and we are focused on sharpening our store execution to do just that. This year, we raised the bar on our full, fresh and friendly customer experience metrics and we are very proud of our store teams who are delivering an even better shopping experience with service metrics at record highs. To continue the momentum in our Grocery business, we are committed to keeping prices low for customers and delivering a consistent experience while growing our pillars of Fresh, Our Brands, Seamless and Personalization. Leading with Fresh, our store team's primary goal this year is to drive more consistent shopping experience and that begins with Fresh. We are introducing new technology that's enabling our teams to better track [Technical Difficulty] Our ongoing work to differentiate and elevate our brands is driving higher profitability. We are identifying new supply sources using more effective promotions and improving product mix, which is contributing to further margin improvements. Now to Seamless. Delivery solutions led digital results again this quarter with an increase in both households and visits. Pickup also had solid growth and focus on delivering best-in-class fulfillment led to strong improvements in key customer experience metrics. This quarter, our teams improved fill rates to a new record high, reduced wait time and delivered a significant improvement in perfect orders compared to last year. Through the power of machine learning and AI, we are developing new ways to elevate the Pickup experience for customers and at the same time reduce costs. With dynamic batching of orders, these tools are providing associates the most effective pick routes, which is enabling us to dramatically reduce pick lead time in our highest volume stores. Our customers love the Kroger delivery experience with refrigerated products delivered directly to their doorstep. As a result, the Kroger delivery network has experienced remarkable growth with sales nearly doubling this quarter versus last year. As we focus on providing an incredible customer experience, we are learning and adjusting the delivery network. A good example of this is our decision in the first quarter to close three spoke locations to reallocate capacity closer to our automated fulfillment centers where we have higher customer density and better order level profitability. This decision does not impact Kroger's automated FCs or other spoke locations. We remain confident that our Kroger delivery network provides a differentiated customer experience and will continue to be a key pillar of our digital growth strategy. Turning to Personalization. The combination of seamless and our personalization capabilities generated another quarter of digital engagement growth, up 9% compared to the same quarter last year. Personalization enables us to balance the depth and breadth of our promotions more effectively and encourages customers to engage more with us by focusing on promotions that matter most to them. This led to an 18% increase in digital coupon clips compared to last year. Capturing more digital households is a key to our long-term growth model as these households are more loyal, spend nearly three times as much with us and drive our alternative profit businesses. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we create momentum in our Grocery business. In turn, this creates the data and traffic to accelerate growth in areas like Health & Wellness and our Alternative Profit businesses. Alternative Profit businesses had a strong quarter led by growth in Kroger Precision Marketing. KPM results were in-line with what we expected and keep us on track to meet our full-year expectations of more than 20% media growth. Yesterday, KPM continued to broaden its reach by offering its custom audiences and ad measurement capabilities to advertisers on the Meta social media platforms. This is another important step in KPM's growth, creating more opportunities for clients to reach relevant audiences in more places and providing better transparency to add effectiveness. Health & Wellness grew its top line this quarter. However, profitability results were below expectations. We are optimistic about the potential of this area of our business. Our script adherence initiatives are on track and our teams are providing excellent care which helps patients live healthier lives. Additionally, our marketing plans and in-store activations designed to raise awareness and attract new patients are launching now to help drive growth in the back half of the year. Turning now to associates. Our associates are doing an excellent job elevating the customer experience and improving our full, fresh and friendly metrics this quarter. Team consistency leads to better execution and retention improved again this quarter. We are retaining more associates through a holistic approach which includes wage and benefit investments and also a focus on associates well-being and this work is being recognized. This quarter, Kroger received the 2024 Platinum Bell Seal for Workplace Mental Health. This is the third consecutive year that we've been recognized with the certification. And for the first time we received the top distinction. This program recognized Kroger as an employer who creates a mentally healthy workplace for our associates through culture, benefits, compliance and wellness programs. We'll continue to invest in our associates. When our associates have a better experience, they provide a better experience to our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Todd to take you through our first quarter financial results. Todd? Thanks, Todd. As you've heard from both of us, our Grocery business is performing well and we are building momentum across our business. Kroger is operating from a position of strength. We have the right strategy, which is resonating with customers, and we have the financial strength to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. As we continue to prepare for our merger with Albertsons, I'd like to thank our associates for their incredible commitment. Since we announced the proposed merger back in October of 2022, our associates have done an exceptional job preparing for the integration with Albertsons while never once taking their eye off the ball of serving our customers, advancing our strategy, operating our business and driving results. Because of their efforts, we will be prepared to hit the ground running as a combined company ready to serve more customers from day one. A more general merger update, in April, we announced an expanded divestiture plan with C&S, which directly responds to the concerns raised by federal and state antitrust regulators regarding the original agreement. We believe the package, which includes a modified and expanded store set and more non-store assets, bolsters Kroger's position and regulatory challenges to the proposed merger. Including our upcoming court proceedings, it also positions C&S to be a strong and successful competitor. We are prepared to defend our merger because it will produce meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, for associates and for communities across the country. Customers will benefit from lower prices and more choices following the merger close. We have committed to investing $500 million to begin lowering prices day one following close, along with an additional $1.3 billion to improve Albertsons stores. Employees will benefit from Kroger's commitment to invest $1 billion to raise wages and comprehensive benefits, further building on our $2.4 billion and incremental investments since 2018. As union membership continues to decline nationwide, this merger will secure union jobs. And communities will benefit from the strength and the ability of the combined company to accelerate Kroger's commitment to ending hunger. As a combined company, Kroger has committed to donating 10 billion meals to families across the US by 2030. In closing, Kroger is off to a solid start to the year, positioning us well to deliver on our commitments. We continue to invest in associates and the associate experience because when they have a better experience, our customers do as well. Grocery results are off to a better-than-expected start, which provides the foundation for growth in Alternative Profit businesses and our model is generating strong free cash flow, which has strengthened our balance sheet and positions us for future growth. With that Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning. Good morning. I want to just add a couple of points on Todd's last point. We continue to have good success with value-add product and typically that product is something that the customer can eat almost immediately in the car or at home, and that's helping on margin. And then our sourcing teams continue to have making progress in cost of goods, which helps as well. If you look at overall, as you know, for the last, I don't know, 15, 18 years, part of the Kroger's strategy has always been to invest in pricing every year and 2024 wouldn't have been any different than any of the previous years. And we continue to execute against that plan of helping the customer stretch their budget. If you look at where we feel on our relative price position, we feel very good. And one of the things that we even -- was glad to see is if you look at the customer that's on a budget, for the first time in over a year, we actually had growth in count from that customer base. So overall, we feel good about where we are. One of the things I always think it's important to remember too is, as a promotional merchant, people buy a lot more when things are in promotion. We also have a very sophisticated rewards program for personalized offers that publicly you wouldn't see and also our fuel rewards. So overall, we feel good about where we are and we feel good about where we are relative to any of our competitors. Thanks, Rupesh. If you look at CPG partners, overall, we would be seeing more trade dollars than in the past, and I think some of that ties to the comment I made before on sourcing. As economists always say, all short statements are incorrect. There are some CPG partners that aren't worried as much about tonnage and wouldn't be as aggressive. But we are seeing an increased trend where CPG most CPG partners are starting to focus on tonnage again and then trying to partner with us more aggressively to help tonnage. If you look at regional competitors, really wouldn't see much difference there than the national competitors. And overall inflation is up slightly. You would see people raising slightly more prices than lowering. But nothing that's especially different there than what we would see. And as you know, there's a ton of great awesome regional competitors out there. Thanks, Robby. Yeah, if you look at the first quarter performance, as Todd and I both mentioned, we felt very good about where we were finished or where it turned out. One of the things I always think it's, the first quarter is so early in the year, I never felt -- it would be unusual for us to feel comfortable changing too much. If you look at things that we felt good about or the things that we outlined in the prepared comments around our customer count growth, the growth that's broad-based across all of our customer types, our store team is doing a very good job of continuing to improve the experience and in-stock positions and all those things. The couple of headwinds that we do have is if you look at like incentive plans, especially in the second quarter, we'll have significantly higher incentive plan accruals in the second quarter than what we did a year ago, which is partially what's affecting the second quarter. But overall, for the year, we feel good about where we are. We feel good about where we are relative to where we thought we would be. But it's really too early in the year to make too many changes. Thanks, Zach. Yeah, I'll let Todd answer the second part. On inflation for the year, the first quarter was pretty much where we expected it to be. Where we, for the year, it's pretty consistent with where we thought it would be. So if I'm going off of memory, but I think we said it was slightly over 1% and we would continue to see it slightly over 1%. It's -- if you look at some of the commodity -- the commodities themselves, obviously that will bounce up and down. And as you get later in the year, we -- that some of that bounce will be driven by what kind of crop year is it relative to corn and some of those things. But really overall, what we expect inflation to be similar to where we did last year and it is starting to stabilize. We don't see deflation broad-based at all, but it is stabilizing around that little over 1%. Okay. Thanks, Ken. Yeah, if you look, and John, we've talked about it a lot of times, I always say our job one is to make sure we don't lose the customer and job two is we have the responsibility to figure out how to be profitable with each of those customers. We do have some divisions that are now at breakeven or slightly profitable. And if you look at incrementally on a per order basis, through almost all of our channels, now they're -- incrementally they're contributing. In terms of our expectation of ourself is that, that customer will be just as profitable as a store customer over time. I don't know that I would put a specific date on it yet, but that is the expectations we have for ourselves. And the key things on it will be continuing, for me, I think number one is making sure our NPS scores stay strong because that's what causes that customer to continue to repeat. Then making sure that each basket we start getting where the customer adds items within a basket and then always from an operating cost standpoint, we'll continue to use our technology to be more efficient. And as we look longer term, three years or five years, we definitely think there'll be less capacity. And as you noted, there's a significant number of closures by the other three players in that space. And there's a lot of work that's being done from a governmental standpoint around PBMs. The thing that I get super excited about, our pharmacies and our Health & Wellness teams, they continue to do a great job of improving the experience. And I think it's amazing that a third of our customers don't even realize we have a pharmacy. And we're obviously working incredibly hard to make sure that third of our customers that don't even realize we have a custom that we have a pharmacy to get them to convert and become a patient of our pharmacy because our teams do an amazing job on service. We have incredibly quick lines and things like that and it's one less trip that somebody has to make. So thanks, John, for the question. Good morning. In terms of overall, I would say, in terms of promotional activity looks very similar to pre-COVID and for the first time it finally starts looking and feeling more like pre-COVID times. As I mentioned a second ago, overall, we saw more prices go up than go down, when you look at the individual number of SKUs. I feel really good about where we are and I feel good about our teams and their ability to continue taking care of customers. In terms of the valued customer, I think, a lot of it is driven more from some of the things that we've done relative to our new brand in terms of Smart Way, helping that customer understand that they can come and shop with us and it's -- and you don't have to compromise relative to fresh and quality and some of those other aspects and experience -- the customer experience or associate experience that they give. So when you look at it overall, it's pretty consistent with where we thought it would be. And part of it, I think, is just the moderating inflation, but we still continue to expect a little bit of inflation. And the other thing, it's a great question. It's hard to give a specific data other than I can assure you that our team is working really hard to get there. We're also -- and this is something I would say we've always done, but you always try to get better. And if you look at capital investments, we would also be using capital investments to support that growth. And as you know, we're starting to increase the number of stores that we're opening. And the maturity of those stores and the remodel of those stores also help with identicals over time. And we would expect that to obviously be the case now. And as Todd mentioned, it's early in the slightly higher capital spending for new stores and expansions and stuff, but we're pleased with the early results. Thanks, Michael. Yeah, and as you know, we do expect IDs to improve throughout the year and we continue -- so far we're continuing to see that and would expect that to continue. I'll make a couple of comments, and Todd, feel free to add. One of the things as you get to the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter is vaccines. And as you know, last year our teams did an amazing job of increasing the number of vaccines we gave. And we have a ton of learnings that we think will be able to do that again this year. And the -- so when you look at just the pharmacy business, part of that will be that. And also on some of the supply issues, we would hope that and expect for those to get more normalized and like the one drug that Todd was talking about, the generics, as they come out and stuff, historically, that's always improved profitability. And we would expect at some point in this latter part of the year for those things to happen. Relative to the other pieces, Todd, I'll let you. Thanks, Michael. Good morning. We really view our lowest cost of capital is a BBB rating. And if you look at it historically, it's like 80% of the time that would be the lowest cost of capital. And as you look at the markets going forward, we don't see anything that would cause that to change. So that gives you the financial flexibility to do things like merging with Albertsons. It also creates the lowest cost of capital. And the reason we always reiterate that 2.3 to 2.5 is that really is the point that we believe creates a solid BBB rating. And the thing that, as Todd and I both mentioned, the business continues to be incredibly strong from a free cash flow standpoint and the anticipation going forward. So it gives us the opportunity to continue to invest in the business, continue to grow the business, and we can't wait to be able to merge with Albertsons, so we can do that at even a scale a little bit bigger. So thanks, Ed, for the questions. Good morning. If you look, the tonnage trends are all trying to think if there's any exception to this, they're all in the right direction and they're improving. If you look at historically, part of that, we believe, is because of the moderating inflation, part of it is because of doing a better job on in-stock and the customer experience and connecting better with each customer segment. So we feel good about those trends for multiple of reasons. Was there a follow-up question or? Yeah. And if you look at some of the things that's in margin, like, warehouse and transportation costs, our teams are making good progress there, reducing the number of empty miles, taking and managing more of the transportation. So there's a lot -- one of the things, as you know, we've done a ton of work over the last five years or 10 years on diversifying our business model and how we create value. And part of it is the traffic that our base business creates being able to monetize that in ways that the customer actually views and finds of value. Thanks, Kelly. When you look at upside, I think, our whole team feels incredibly good. If you were in one of our meetings, you would hear us talk about all the things that we can get better at, and it's things that matter to our associates and matter to our customers. So we're incredibly excited about the continued opportunity we have on getting better. On the store execution, obviously, they always say retail is detail and it literally is working with every single store. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, turnover continue to improve. When turnover is lower, when retention is better, it helps on the experience, it helps on the execution in the store, on in-stocks and other things. Our teams are doing a very good job on Fresh and that's everything from our supply chain to our folks ordering product to using AI to make sure the right stores get the right product, to the stores getting it out on the shelf and helping the customer have a couple more days of freshness at home. So it's really all of those things together that we think it's what's driving the increased traffic and increased in connection with our customers. So it's obviously super proud of the whole team and excited about the opportunities going in front of us. Yeah. If you look at vendor funding, we would expect it to continue to increase because you know that CPGs are trying to move tonnage. If you look at overall, we would, I think, feel like it's pretty much backed up pre-COVID but at a higher level. Some CPGs have increased their margins without, so they're just making flat-out more profit. So we think they actually have room to even further invest in trade dollars. Yeah, there isn't things that are going on out there that I would say that's causing us to be reactive. You always pay attention and I spend as much time getting to the competitors' store as I do our own stores. But when I look at overall, we're running our plan and we're using our data and insights to make sure that we're taking care of our customers and associates. So I feel really good about where we are overall on that. So thanks for the questions. Good morning, Chuck. Yeah. If you look, sorry that you got cut off, but the delivery business almost doubled year-on-year. It's pretty broad based on all customer segments, but I think one of the things that's important to remember is that our technology allows us to do a better job now accepting SNAP and some of those things than what it did a year ago. So it's really across all customers. I think the thing that's driving it is our teams are doing a nice job on making sure the experience is good. I can tell you in Florida, people get ice cream that's still frozen and chocolate that's not melted because of our delivery, because of the delivery trucks.

The short answer is yes.

            "name": "Todd Foley",
            "content": "Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's first quarter performance reflects the resiliency of our model, which enables us to manage a variety of economic cycles. The strength of our model combined with the momentum in our Grocery business gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance even as we continue to navigate an environment of economic uncertainty. I'll now take you through our first quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 0.5%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our identical sales were driven by several positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households and increased customer visits. We continue to see sequential unit improvement and our teams remain focused on returning to positive units later this year. Inflation continues to moderate, which is consistent with our expectations at the start of the year, and towards the end of the first quarter, we began cycling the headwinds from the reduction in SNAP benefits. Digital sales grew by more than 8%, which was led by 17% growth in delivery solutions. Gross margin was 22.4% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased seven basis points. The decrease in rate was primarily attributable to lower pharmacy margins and increased price investments partially offset by favorable product mix reflecting Our Brands' margin performance. The slight decline in our FIFO gross margin rate was in line with our expectations. We expect our FIFO gross margin rate to improve beyond our first quarter result driven by the core components of our margin expansion initiatives. During the first quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $41 million compared to a charge of $99 million for the same quarter last year. The decreased charge for the quarter was due to lower inflation expectations for the current year compared to last year. The OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items increased 22 basis points, driven by planned investments in associate wages and increased incentive plan costs partially offset by continued execution of cost savings initiatives. In the second quarter, we expect the factors identified in the first quarter to continue, leading to a similar to slightly higher OG&A rate. We expect our OG&A rate to improve in the second half of 2024. We continue to make progress on our digital profitability, delivering another quarter of improvement in our pickup cost to serve. It remains a long-term margin opportunity with runway to improve through increased volume and process enhancements. Our store associates played a key role in the cost to serve improvements and, as Rodney mentioned earlier, did so while they improved key customer experience metrics. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.499 billion. Our adjusted EPS was $1.43 per diluted share, a decline of $0.05 compared to last year. Fuel continues to be a key driver of our strategy to build loyalty by providing compelling fuel rewards to customers. We continue to see more reward activity with 8% more redemptions contributing to gallon sales, which outpaced the industry this quarter. However, our fuel profitability was below expectations this quarter with our cents per gallon fuel margin down low single-digits compared to last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. We continue to invest in our associates as part of our long-term strategy, resulting in an average hourly rate of $19 an hour and a rate of nearly $25, with comprehensive benefits factored in. During the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for our Houston Clerks and Meat, Mid-Atlantic Division stores in West Virginia, South Carolina stores in Columbia and Myrtle Beach and Portland Distribution Center and Drivers covering more than 21,000 associates. Turning to cash flow. Kroger continues to generate adjusted free cash flow, strong adjusted free cash flow, through consistent operating results which is enabling us to continue deleveraging in anticipation of our merger with Albertsons. At the end of the quarter, Kroger's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.25 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides ample opportunities for Kroger to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on projects which drive long-term sustainable net earnings growth while remaining committed to our investment grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time subject to board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. As part of our capital investment plans for 2024, we shared last quarter our plans for approximately 30 major storing projects focused on higher growth geographies, where we have traditionally achieved a strong ROIC and operating profit growth. We've made good progress on our projects so far and remain on track with our plans. While early, we're happy with the results from projects completed in the first quarter. We are confident these new storing projects will help advance our omnichannel strategy and be an important component to our sales growth and TSR model going forward. During the first quarter, we announced we had entered an agreement for the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business. As part of our regular and ongoing review of our portfolio, we determined that Specialty Pharmacy was not part of our core strategy going forward and a sale would enable us to focus on our Health & Wellness strategies that revolve around our retail pharmacies. Due to the sale, a non-recurring held for sale tax adjustment of $31 million was recognized in the quarter and it has been reflected as an adjustment item in our results. The sale of KSP is not expected to have an impact on our 2024 guidance. I'd now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. Today, we reaffirmed our annual guidance reflecting both positive momentum we are seeing in our business along with a more cautious customer environment in the near term. In terms of quarterly cadence, we now expect a decline in adjusted EPS for the second quarter similar to the rate we observed in the first quarter as we expect pharmacy business profitability pressures to carry over into the second quarter. This reaffirms where we expected to be through both the first half of the year as well as the full fiscal 2024. In closing, our first quarter performance reflects the strength and resiliency of our model. We are strengthening our Grocery business, which drives the data and traffic to accelerate growth in our Alternative Profit businesses and we remain confident in our ability to drive attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney. Yeah, thanks, Rupesh. Great question. We talked at the beginning of the year that our expectation was to have relatively flat year-over-year gross margin and that is still the expectation. As mentioned in my comments, we do expect results for the balance of the year to improve beyond our Q1 results and that's really reflective of some of the gross margin expansion efforts that we have going on. They're going actually really well. We alluded to our Our Brands performance. Our margins in Our Brands continue to do very well and as that business continues to grow, particularly in today's environment, we talked about the budget-conscious consumer and that continues to connect with them. And so the growth in that business helps drive the margins and we expect to see that as the year goes on. Fresh is another category where we've had meaningful growth. Fresh is doing really well. We've talked a lot about produce, our end-to-end Fresh and how that business is growing. And certainly that comes with higher margins, which has a positive effect on our mix. And then when you look at Alternative Profits and in particular retail media, that business continues to grow well and especially the second half of the year. We expect retail media to continue its momentum to achieve our growth of excess of 20% for the year. A lot going on in that space. And we went to a new platform a year ago and as we went and ramped up the platform a year ago, we'll be cycling that period of time with some of the momentum we have in that business. So all of those are where a lot of our confidence comes from when we talk about reaffirming our guidance for the year. And we alluded to some of the pharmacy headwinds. Even though we expect some of those to carry over into the second quarter, I think all of the results that we're seeing from our margin expansion efforts are going to continue to drive us so that we hit our expectations to improve the result relative to Q1. That's a good call, Rodney. And actually the two go together. The strength we saw in the first half of the business is really tied to your incentive plan comment. A big contributor to the strength we're seeing in our Grocery business is around our teams delivering on store execution and the shopping experience and improvement in those metrics is an important part of our incentive plan this year. So it's -- those two thoughts are connected with one another. Yeah, that's great. And on the fuel point, we did -- in my comments that we did see that cents per gallon margin was down low single digits. John, I'll talk to the headwinds a little bit. What we're seeing there was really a couple of items in product mix. One was around GLP-1. We've talked about that before. It's a high retail ring, but an extremely low margin and so that puts pressure on our margins. And coming into the year, if you recall the latter part of last year, we had supply constraints on GLP-1. And so some of those restraints were relieved in the first quarter. And frankly, our team did a really nice job with suppliers getting out there to get product to meet demand in our stores. And so our sales exceeded what we expected to see in the first quarter and that put a little bit of that unexpected pressure on margins. And then the second, there's another category of drugs as well, where we saw some regulatory restrictions that were unexpected that drove up the cost on those meds and put some pressure on the margin. So when we talked about some unexpected trends in Pharmacy, it was really around product mix in those couple of areas, and wanted to make sure we called it out, because we do see that carrying over into the second part of the year, it wasn't necessarily reimbursement related. I think you're right. Our model is to drive 2% to 4% ID sales. And as you looked at -- we talked a lot last quarter around the dynamics of inflation and what we saw last year with the rapid disinflation throughout the year. And as we get back to this year, that more normal inflation environment that Rodney alluded to, and we start cycling those heavy disinflations. We talk about the -- getting towards the high end of our guidance range relative to sales by the second half of the year and I think that starts to get us back into that range that our long-term model is based on in the 2% to 4%. Yeah, the first quarter was a little choppy because we had a Easter mismatch relative to the calendar. But the general trend throughout the quarter was that we saw IDs increase steadily as we went through the quarter on average. And then as we look to Q2 to date, so far, we're right on plan relative to our expectations for Q2 results in the guidance that we've given. You're right on with what I was going to say on pharmacy, Rodney, and just overall with the business. I alluded to earlier, the margin expansion efforts that we're seeing, and those are all factored into the guidance for the rest of the year. And even given those pharmacy headwinds, we expect the pharmacy or the margin expansion, the gross margin expansion initiatives that we have blended with the pharmacy headwinds that we called out should enable us to achieve gross profit results beyond what we saw in the first quarter. Yeah, no, you're right. And it is primarily based on pharmacy and incentive. You are correct. From a fuel perspective, that's so volatile. It's really week to week. It's part of what we keep our eye on as we go forward. So far it has been closer to our expectations for the quarter, but that's one that we truly monitor daily and weekly to understand the impact it's having on the business. I think long-term, our targets at 2.3 to 2.5 are in the right place. That is -- one of our key objectives is to maintain our investment grade rating and over time, it's proven that is the range that enables us to be able to do that. So I think we long-term continue to look to operate within that range, with or without the merger, frankly. And the beauty with where we're at here, you're right, we do have a lot of capacity there. Obviously, we're firmly focused on closing the merger and being able to use that capacity relative to the merger and come out the other end. But I think in any scenario, the capital allocation approach that we've taken over time, we've got a long track record on what that is and how we do it. And I would expect this to execute under that framework on a go-forward basis. Yeah, Kelly, I think it's -- you hit on part of it. I don't think it's just Alternative Profit. I think we have today more levers maybe than we've had in the past to be able to drive that value through margin expansion. So it's Alternative Profit and retail media. It's what our merchants do. We've already talked a little bit today about our brands and the value that our brand brings and the margin expansion there. And same with Fresh. I think it's all of those areas. And I think it's also the things that we continue to do with process improvement, whether it's in supply chain, whether it's continuing to drive down shrink, et cetera, et cetera. So I think it's the variety of margin improvement initiatives that we have. It is -- it's what's a little different than maybe what we saw several years ago, because we have various sources of value to help fund those investments in our customers and in our associates frankly. To your comment on reactive versus proactive, when we put our plan together for the year and our guidance in the whole nine yards, we put together our pricing strategy for the year and we're executing on the strategy that we've put in place and we think clearly customers are responding to that very favorably. We're not deviating from the plan that we have -- that we've put into place. We're executing our playbook. Rodney mentioned it earlier. It's what we've done for 15 years or 20 years and we've stuck to our playbook and we think that's what's resonating with our customers."
