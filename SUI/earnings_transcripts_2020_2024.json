A question-and-answer session will follow after the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results as well as our 2021 guidance. We hope that you and your families are in good health as we continue to navigate the challenges of the pandemic. We are very pleased with the resilience of our portfolio and the commitment and humanity of our team members during this most difficult time. The stable growth we delivered in the environment further demonstrates the strength of manufactured housing and RV resorts through economic cycles. It also underscores our rationale for meaningfully expanding our platform with the acquisition of Safe Harbor Marinas, a business that exhibits similar stability and growth characteristics. For the year, Sun generated core FFO per share growth of 3.5%. Same community NOI growth of 4% added over 2,500 revenue-producing sites and achieved total portfolio occupancy of 97.3%, a 90 basis point improvement over 2019. To drive additional future growth, we acquired almost $3 billion of properties in 2020. Over $600 million of our acquisitions took place in the fourth quarter after the closing of the Safe Harbor transaction. Total acquisitions for the year included 24 manufactured housing communities and RV resorts with over 6,900 sites and 106 marinas with nearly 39,000 wet slips and dry storage spaces. Additionally, post year-end, through the date of this call, we have closed acquisitions totaling over $43 million, including 1 manufactured housing community, 2 RV resorts and 2 marinas.  We are actively pursuing opportunities in each of our segments. Our extensive experience, track record and industry relationships have helped continue to facilitate successful MH and RV transactions. On the marina side, since the closing of the Safe Harbor transaction, we have added 7 additional marinas, inclusive of the world-class Rybovich superyacht marinas in West Palm Beach and Riviera Beach, Florida. The Rybovich team is joining Safe Harbor, and we expect them to drive incremental growth across the entire marina portfolio given the specialized nature of superyacht marina operations.  As we reflect on the events of 2020 and look optimistically to the future, we are encouraged by the fundamentals of our business. The demand for high-quality, affordable housing and vacationing is as strong as ever. Even with the various shelter-in-place restrictions throughout 2020 and into 2021, applications to live in a Sun community remain at an all-time high as we received almost 50,000 applications in 2020 and sold nearly 2,900 homes. Our RV resort performance remains strong as travelers who wanted an increased level of control and safety chose our resorts for some much-needed rest. We believe that RVing attracted a large number of first timers, as indicated by a 6% year-over-year growth in RV shipments, including an almost 50% increase in RV shipments for the month of December. We anticipate that many of those first timers are likely to be repeat customers in the years ahead. We see numerous similarities with respect to marinas as a wide portion of the population became first time boat owners as well. According to industry sources, there was a 35% increase in the number of purchases by first time boat buyers in 2020. In short, we expect there will be sustained demand across each of our business lines. As we look to operational initiatives for 2021, Sun is positioned to continue to execute on our 4 core investment strategies. The first is reinvestment in our properties to ensure sustained demand and to maintain the high-quality of our assets. Second is the pursuit of accretive acquisitions of operating manufactured housing communities, RV resorts and marinas. Our acquisition pipeline is as full as it has ever been. Sellers continue to see the benefits of a transaction with Sun given the certainty of execution, tax deferment strategies and the knowledge that Sun will improve and continue managing these assets to the highest possible standards. Our third investment strategy is the construction of expansion sites. And last is the construction of greenfield developments. Together, these 4 strategies support the long-term sustainability of delivering industry-leading growth. As our company has grown significantly, we have decided to expand the size of our Board and recently announced the appointment of Tonya Allen as an independent director. Tonya brings a wealth of experience and expertise in the fields of education and economic development and will be a tremendous asset to our team. We welcome Tonya and look forward to having her expert perspective on sustainability and social issues as part of our Board initiative and leadership moving forward. Our success would not be possible without the dedication and commitment of our team members, who continually place the highest priority on the health and safety of our residents and guests. Through the many challenges this past year, our team consistently rose to the occasion and worked tirelessly to produce these positive results. I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to the entire team as I am very proud of what we have been able to accomplish together. I will now turn the call over to John and Karen to discuss the results in further detail.\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. Our solid performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 demonstrate the resilience of our operations across manufactured housing, RV resorts and marinas. We benefited from heightened demand for our RV resorts in the second half of the year and the steadiness of manufactured housing through all of 2020. Our same community results reflect the stability of the platform as we work through the challenges of the pandemic. For the fourth quarter, same community NOI increased by 2.1%. Excluding direct COVID-19-related expenses of $300,000, our same community NOI growth would have been 2.4%. In the fourth quarter, same community NOI was driven by a 5.7% growth in revenues, reflecting a 3.8% increase in weighted average monthly rent and a 180 basis point occupancy gain. Breaking it down further, manufactured housing revenues grew by 4.8%, annual RV grew by 1.9% and transient RV grew by almost 18%. If it were not for the mandated closures of our resorts in California starting in December as well as the continued Canadian travel restrictions, our fourth quarter transient RV results would have been even stronger. The good news is that travel restrictions were lifted in California at the beginning of February, and we have already begun to welcome our guests to these resorts. Expenses in the fourth quarter were elevated predominantly due to the costs associated with the pandemic, along with higher payroll, supply and repairs and utilities at RV resorts had at extended seasons. For the full year, same community NOI increased 4%. Excluding $2.4 million of direct COVID-related expenses, same community NOI would have increased by 4.4%. This growth reflects a 3.6% revenue increase and a 3% increase in same community expenses. The revenue growth was primarily driven by a 4.5% increase in annual RV revenues and 5.6% growth from manufactured housing revenues. Same community transient RV revenues were down 5% for the year, reflecting the delayed opening of 44 of our seasonal resorts due to COVID-related travel restrictions in the late spring and early summer. Our RV transient business saw a meaningful rebound with same community transient RV revenues growing by 5% in the third quarter and 17.8% in the fourth quarter as compared to the same periods of 2019. Our RV property performance will be affected in the first quarter by the California shelter-in-place order that ran through the early part of February. Additionally, the continued Canadian border closure has prevented some of our guests from returning to our Southern resorts for the season. Combined these 2 events are estimated to have an impact of $8 million to $10 million to transient RV revenues, which is reflected in our first quarter and annual 2021 guidance.  Even as the impact of the pandemic persists, forward bookings for the second quarter are pacing meaningfully ahead with current on the books revenues 18% above this time last year. From a total portfolio perspective, we gained 578 revenue-producing sites for the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to over 2,500. The addition of these sites increased our total portfolio occupancy to 97.3% from 96.4% a year ago. Of our revenue-producing site gains for the year, 1,070 or roughly 43%, were in our manufactured housing expansion communities.  For the year, 863 transient RV sites were converted to annual leases. The development of ground-up and expansion sites is a consistent growth driver for us. In 2020, we delivered over 1,300 vacant ground-up and expansion sites. These recently completed expansion ground-up development sites will contribute to growth in 2021 and beyond as they fill up and stabilize. Additionally, we currently have over 10,000 zoned and entitled sites in our portfolio for expansion and ground-up developments, which, when developed, should contribute to our growth in future years. Moving on to home sales. We sold 782 homes for the quarter and 2,866 homes for the year. 850 of these home sales were conversions of renters to owners in 2020. We saw new home gross profit expansion of 3.6% year-over-year, driven by strong margins in Colorado, Connecticut and Ontario.  For the year, average home sales prices rose for both new and preowned homes by 11.3% and 8.8%, respectively. The new home sales and our ground-up and redevelopments in Colorado and Florida contributed to this increase. Brokered home sales throughout Sun's portfolio saw a 15% increase in total sales year-over-year as the resale market was strong as ever. Average brokered home prices in our communities increased by over 21% in 2020. A healthy resale market is very important for our success as new and existing residents see the value of choosing to live in a Sun community given the quality and level of ongoing reinvestment that goes into our properties. Sun has maintained strong rent collection rates throughout 2020. Total rent collection rates for manufactured housing communities and annual RVs for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 were over 96% and 97%, respectively, after adjusting for the impact of COVID-19-related hardship deferrals and prepaid rent balances. January collections were over 97% for both manufactured housing and annual RV. Through February 16, we have collected 95% for both our manufactured housing communities and for our annual RVs, which is consistent with prior year collections. With respect to Safe Harbor, we closed our acquisition on October 30, 2020. The fourth quarter performance was solid with a 2-month NOI contribution of $17.9 million. COVID-related tailwinds like the surge of new boat ownership, which Gary discussed, helped drive strong wet slip rental and on land winter storage revenue. Given the ability to enjoy the outdoors in a safe and self-control environment, we anticipate marinas to be an important growth driver for the coming years. In closing, 2020 posed both numerous challenges and opportunities for Sun. We have grown as an organization and are stronger than ever. We are proud of our team members' dedication to our residents and guests and are grateful for their efforts in a truly challenging year. Karen will now discuss our financial results. Karen?\nKaren Dearing: Thanks, John. For the fourth quarter, Sun reported core FFO per share of $1.16, 5.5% above the prior year and $0.04 ahead of the top end of our guidance range. These results reflect better-than-expected performance from our ground-up developments and recently completed acquisitions, including Safe Harbor Marinas. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, core FFO per share was $5.09, up 3.5% from 2019. We are very pleased with our results and our positioning for 2021. During the year, we acquired almost $3 billion of operating properties, including the Safe Harbor Marinas portfolio. Subsequent to year-end, we acquired a manufactured housing community for redevelopment adjacent to an existing community, 2 RV resorts and 2 marinas for a combined $43 million.  We had an active year on the capital markets front, raising approximately $1.9 billion in equity to ensure the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet to support our acquisitions and growth initiatives. We ended 2020 with $4.8 billion of debt outstanding at a 3.4% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 9.4 years. We had $83 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio of 6.9 times. Pro forma leverage, including the estimated full year EBITDA contribution from Safe Harbor and other acquisitions, is in the mid-to-high 5 times EBITDA, which is in line with our long-term leverage target. Our performance in 2020 and the confidence we have in the ability to continue to generate industry-leading results provided the incentive for our Board to raise our 2021 distribution to $3.32 per share, up 5.1% from last year. This is our fifth consecutive annual distribution increase. Turning to guidance. For the year, we expect core FFO to be in the range of $5.79 to $5.95 per share, an increase of 15.3% at the midpoint. First quarter FFO is expected to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.17 per share. Moving to internal growth drivers. We are anticipating a 2021 same community NOI growth range of 5.6% to 6.6%, which includes a blended weighted average monthly rent increase of 3.4% for manufactured housing and annual RV. Our core FFO and same community NOI guidance assumes lower transient RV revenue contributions in the first quarter of approximately $8 million to $10 million due to the California shelter-in-place order, which ended in early February, and the extension of the Canadian border closure.  We expect revenue-producing site gains throughout the year to be between 2,150 and 2,350. On the development front, we plan to deliver 1,200 to 1,600 vacant expansion and ground-up development sites in 2021. For our marina business, we expect total NOI, inclusive of service and ancillary contributions, of $163 million to $169 million. With respect to our G&A guidance, we expect our 2021 G&A expense to be in the range of $164 million to $167 million. Approximately $33 million of the year-over-year increase is attributed to marinas as we scale that platform to capture and support the integration and operations of the large consolidation opportunity we see before us. As Safe Harbor transitions from a private operator to a wholly-owned subsidiary of a public company, it requires an expanded operating infrastructure and financial reporting structure to support both its regulatory obligations, primarily around reporting and future growth potential. This level of G&A supports both the operationally-intensive nature of the marina business as well as our expectation for the marina portfolio to be in high-growth mode over the next several years. In just our first 90 days of ownership, we've increased the marina portfolio's transaction value by over 20%. We want to ensure that the business and the team are set up for success and anticipate that marina-related G&A will be leveraged over time. It's important to note, there is seasonality in our portfolio. Please refer to our supplemental for additional disclosures on expected seasonality for total MH and RV NOI, marina NOI and core FFO. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. Finally, we'd like to note that starting with our first quarter earnings release, we intend to provide enhanced reporting disclosures in our supplemental across MH, RV and marinas. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's actually [Lou Asscherick] on for Josh today. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just jumping on to the marina side. We thought that Safe Harbor is hosting regattas in Newport this August. Do you envision hosting similar events across the different areas in your marina portfolio over time? Are there any other events that the team is working on that might drive traffic across your marina's portfolio? I know you mentioned a little bit more on the ancillary side for the NOI, but just kind of trying to figure out what else is part of it.\nGary Shiffman: So it's Gary. I think that we're very excited to participate in the first event that you described. And I think it is the beginning of trying to tie a very large membership consisting of close to 50,000 members in the marina right now to the ability to go from Safe Harbor to Safe Harbor Marinas and understand the expectation that one would have in visiting the consistency of how these marinas run and what the services they offer. So I think that this will be the first opportunity to really showcase that. And the Sun staff sitting in this room is as excited as anyone to really participate and really see what the safe harbor management has planned for the future. So with regard to that, we'll be able to share more, with regard to what the future holds in those types of events going forward. So kind of one of the first inaugural step-outs for Sun to participate in this type of safe harbor event. With regard to marina details and disclosures, what we wanted to share with everyone today is that we will be providing enhanced disclosure by business segmentation, and specifically for marinas, with our first quarter earnings release. So in doing so, we'll begin providing separate disclosure on our manufactured housing business line as well as separate disclosure on our RV business line in an effort to really provide insight into each of the 3 business lines. So I think it will be a -- first quarter, we'll have the opportunity to look a little bit more clearly into marinas and the business segmentation as well as helping everyone understand for their review and modeling purposes breaking apart MH and RV as well. So that will be coming first quarter, and we'll be better able to look into the segmentation of each.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And I apologize I may have missed this, but did you guys discuss the guidance for acquisitions this year? Just trying to think about if we are seeing the same flow from 4Q going forward? Or I don't know, I think you might have mentioned that 4Q is usually a big acquisition quarter. So just trying to figure out?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. You didn't miss it. You didn't miss it. We didn't give it. We typically don't give guidance. We usually have forward acquisitions. We usually reference the previous year or the previous few years. Obviously, new with Safe Harbor Marinas acquisitions. But generally, we look forward to $100 million to $400 million of MH and RV acquisitions based on historical numbers, excluding large portfolios, which basically have already been consolidated. And then separately, we spoke about or I mentioned in my remarks that I can share that the acquisition pipeline really in manufactured housing, RV and marinas as absolutely as full as it's ever been. So we certainly have our work cut out for us. We are seeing increased competition in the MH and RV space. And it might not surprise many of you that we're starting to see increased competition in the marina space. So we will be very, very selective that anything we do acquire will be the highest of quality and the highest of opportunity to provide growth and value creation for our shareholders. And we're excited to work through that pipeline and be able to present exactly what we've accomplished each quarter.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: A couple of questions. On the Rybovich portfolio, which is the largest acquisition you've done in marina since Safe Harbor. Is this the first superyacht marina that you've -- that you own? Any -- can you compare some of the characteristics as far as margins, retention rates or growth potential in events of superyacht versus your typical marina?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. It's Gary again. I'll defer to first quarter, when we can really look a little bit deeper into segments of the business, but I would share with you that the Rybovich marina in both locations offers services to the world's largest boats. But when you get into it, the margins remain similar, but because of the unique offerings, the occupancy, the service requirements, which specialties draw in vessels and boats that are less sensitive to the cost of staying in the marina and provide all the ancillary revenue lead towards very good returns against the investment on a pretty predictable basis. So as you look out over a long period of time, the consistency of their growth of revenue is very comfortably predictable, so those are the characteristics of it. But within it, it's just high occupancy, high demand. Their slips can accommodate boats in excess of 300 feet. So it is really the world's largest boats and yachts and sail craft. And I can share with you, it's really a list of the who's who in marina yacht ownership as it's one of the few marinas that can culminate that size and scale of boats.\nJohn Kim: Looking at your guidance this year for marina is at the midpoint of NOI, that's about a 6.6% cap rate. Are you seeing compression on across the board on marinas? Or is it really just the Rybovich portfolio with a lower cap rate acquisition?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. I guess I would describe it that we expected some cap rate compression after our announcement, and there have been a couple of other platforms for sale over the last 12 months. And as we study them carefully and did our research and began to understand the stability of cash flow, the lack of new supply, the demand versus supply fundamentals, the growth in boat ownership, it doesn't come as a surprise to us. I think what does come as a little bit of a surprise as how fast the awareness of many other potential investors are queuing in, in the marina business. So we have heard both on a publicly announced basis and a private basis that there has been cap rate compression taking place. Certainly, marina is changing hands at a lower cap rate than the ability of the Safe Harbor group to generate higher cap rates. So that cap rate is creeping in. And the way I describe it right now is our view on the marinas is that they're trading at a 300 basis points to 400 basis points spread above where we're seeing many manufactured housing and RV communities trading at today. So still a good solid spread. And what I'd share is that the 7 marinas that were closed, including Rybovich, traded in the range of a 6.4% to 8.5% cap rate thus far.\nJohn Kim: Okay. I appreciate the information that you provided on the seasonality of the marina. Can I just ask just given that 58% of NOIs in the second and third quarter, how much visibility you have on those contracts being signed? And if there's any variability cases, any travel restrictions going forward, what the risks are to achieving that NOI?\nKaren Dearing: I think as far as -- are you speaking of maybe in terms of COVID impact and things like that? We don't see much risk associated with that. I mean, the portfolio performed very well through COVID last year. So I don't really see much impact if that were to happen based on what happened last year.\nGary Shiffman: Our second quarter bookings, John?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. I mean on the RV side, our second quarter and third quarter, bookings are pacing ahead of last year. So as I shared in my remarks, I mean, it's just -- it's that -- what Gary has talked about the whole time is there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for people wanting to get outdoors. And the RV asset class, along with the marine asset class, really serve that purpose. So we're really pretty excited about what we see going forward, John.\nGary Shiffman: Yes, MH is all annual contracts. So we've seen how it performed in 2020, so. But for the impact on the Canadian borders John covered and the California closures that are now up in February, we are feeling very comfortable with how 2021 should play out just based on what we saw in 2020.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Last one for me. Just turning over to RVs. When I look at your RV site breakdown in Page 3 of the supplement, the transient RV as a percentage of total RV sites has been increasing over the last year. Now it's 16.8% from 15% a year ago. Is that due to recent acquisitions and expansions? Or is this partially due to a slower conversion rate from transient to annual leasing?\nJohn McLaren: Well, we converted 863 transient guests over to annual leases last year, which is pretty close to what we do on an annual basis. And so I think we're really pleased with that performance. And -- but I would say the bigger part of that, John, has been the development that we have done that's added to that denominator of transient sites that we have in our portfolio, which, of course, are future transient conversion opportunities to annual leases.\nGary Shiffman: That conversion gets us a 40% to 60% per site revenue increase on an annual basis. So...\nKaren Dearing: First year.\nGary Shiffman: First year. So those conversions are very important to us. There's a part of our strategy that seeks to buy transient just as we seek to buy vacancy in our manufactured housing communities because it's an absolute tremendous first year benefit when, A, we get the sites filled and manufactured housing; and B, when we convert the transient. So you will find us stepping up our conversion programs as we get more and more inventory of the transient sites going forward.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: Gary, appreciate the comments on the cap rate differential between marinas and MH and RV. But how does it work on an IRR differential for the acquisitions that you've done recently?\nGary Shiffman: We're excited to demonstrate to the market and our shareholders growth on the marina side, if you're referencing the marina side, I think that part of the excitement by the Safe Harbor management and operational team is the ability to have a strong, well-capitalized partner to enhance and grow the business. So I think the opportunity ahead of us to create increased cap rate, which will generate into a greater IRR over a, call it, a 3 to 5 to 7-year period of time with additional, I think, contraction of cap rate, which will naturally enter in over a period of time. I think the exit cap rates in this particular asset class will be modeled probably more aggressive than the entry if our strategy proves out. And so the IRRs are very, very strong.\nNicholas Joseph: When you compare that to MH or RV where you're getting some level of uplift, should that incremental capital be going to marinas right now or the IRR is pretty similar, given the uplift that you're seeing on the other segments?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. I would say that the capital will go out similarly where we can justify the return we're going to get on it. But due to the ability to buy at a higher cap rate and the strategy and the supposition, as we said, that there'll be cap rate contraction. Then on paper at least, the IRRs grow a little bit faster on the marina side.\nNicholas Joseph: And then just on the G&A side and understand that it's a wholly owned subsidiary. But obviously, there's some cost there. And I'm wondering if there's an opportunity for synergies or to consolidate some of the back end across marinas and the rest of the platform for some savings in the future?\nKaren Dearing: Nick, what I'd say is that, as you mentioned, this -- the marina platform is independently operating. So we did absorb all of the executive team senior operations back office. And we did not underwrite any expected synergies or efficiencies with that platform. And if you think about that platform, it is -- it's scaling, right? It's growing very, very rapidly. It's not scaled yet. So I would think that we will leverage G&A over time, but I would not expect that near term.\nOperator: Our next question is come from the line of Wes Galladay with Baird.\nWesley Golladay: I'd like to talk about the pace of the marina deals. And how much you think was due to pent-up demand for OP units?\nGary Shiffman: That's a great question, Wes. Certainly, both the Sun management and Safe Harbor management when we explored the transaction, both were excited about the opportunity to create a tax-deferred security to be able to unlock the acquisition of marinas that might not otherwise be available. As I know Baxter and the Safe Harbor management have shared on some of our calls, many of these marinas are second and third generation. So the tax recapture and the tax ramifications and the fact that they generally won't qualify for 1031 exchanges, I think, lead us to believe that we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. I think Rybovich is an excellent example of where -- do you recall the exact percentage there of securities? 30?\nKaren Dearing: A 1/3.\nJohn McLaren: A 1/3 of it.\nGary Shiffman: Okay. A 1/3 of it was actually a combination of preferred operating partnership units and operating partnership units. And the Huizenga family really was aligned and wanting to protect the tax implications and obviously defer the impacts. But at the same time, as I mentioned earlier in our remarks, we're really excited to have that entire team with their experience in the superyacht marina world as part of the Safe Harbor team. So not only do the tax securities become important to acquire the property, but in this case, we acquired a management team, relationships in the industry and core competencies that are just going to enhance safe harbor's efforts moving forward. So there's a lot of benefits from having those securities.\nWesley Golladay: Great. And maybe switching over to development. Do you have any planned starts this year? And then maybe a bigger picture for the industry. Do you have a sense of how many active developments there are for MH and RV right now nationally?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. These are all coming to me. I get the operational questions out here to John. It's a great question. And today, we have about 8,400 sites in various stages of predevelopment, okay? 9 manufactured housing communities, 8 RV communities, 2 hybrids. That are hybrids for us are a combination of manufactured housing and RV in a single development. So as we kind of shared, we've been the largest consolidator of manufactured housing communities over the last 10 years or so. And we began to ramp up our efforts on new community development, especially as we saw the severe compression in cap rates, no new supply coming on and having the experience at Sun Communities -- being a developer of new communities initially. We determined that we could start developing communities at better returns than acquiring the existing communities at these compressed cap rates. So today, we'll continue acquiring existing communities where we think the cap rates justify and the growth justified it. But you'll continue to see a focus on development as we think we can generate high single-digit returns upon stabilization, which generally looks to be 3 to 5 years after the construction begins, depending if it's RV or MH.\nWesley Golladay: Great. And then last one, the topic of rent control comes up in a lot of discussions with investors. And just curious if you're seeing it in more of your markets for the MH segment. And if so, how much -- or I guess, what type of restrictions are they looking to implement? And then maybe a follow-up on that would be with the new administration, is there anything in their plans that will impact your business?\nJohn McLaren: Wes, this is John. So no, I mean, no real impact for Sun as far as that's concerned. It's more -- I think some of it really has to do with a simple fact that, as we've shared, we've always been, on average, over at least the last 20 years, rent increases in the 2% to 4% range. We do have some rent control communities in California that are pure rent control, but it's really a smaller part of our portfolio. And the fact that we've always managed that rent increase between 2% to 4%. What I'm seeing out there and what I've heard in various locations, even if we have a single community in a particular state, that a lot of that dialogue, frankly, is sort of within our range that we would be doing anyway. So it doesn't really have a tremendous impact on us at this point.\nWesley Golladay: Great. And anything on the new administration? Any plans that impact your image positively or negative?\nGary Shiffman: Really too early to tell. We're watching it carefully and everyone is. There's a lot of discussion out there. Certainly, a lot of discussion on the HUD front and the continued commentary to focus on affordable or obtainable housing by the government agencies, but we're yet to see any meaningful shift towards anything.\nJohn McLaren: The other thing I'd add, Wes, like some of the numbers that Gary just shared with you in terms of what we have in various stages of entitlement on development is, I think, that we are in a bit of a unique position just because we have constructed 7 ground-up developments now over the last 3 years. And so when I'm going to these meetings with various municipalities and planning commissions and that sort of thing, I'm no longer showing renderings of what we can do. I'm showing what we've actually done. And so with the dialogue from Washington, which is important about attainability and affordability, we're very well able to demonstrate how we play so well into that -- into helping with that crisis.\nOperator: Our next question is come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.\nJohn Pawlowski: Gary or John, I want to understand the scalability of Safe Harbor's platform a little bit better. And so you have to bring on the Rybovich team for yacht expertise. Just curious, as this grows, are there any -- it takes you to different regions of the country or different types of marinas, are we going to see big step changes in G&A over the coming years? Or do we now have all the expertise in-house to scale your marine investment?\nGary Shiffman: John, that really is a great question. And obviously, as we prepared for budgeting for the acquisition of Safe Harbor and to discuss guidance, we tried to be very, very transparent in our G&A, and we ask that question ourselves, even during the underwriting. This should be very scalable. We do underwrite to a approximately 3% of...\nKaren Dearing: Revenue.\nGary Shiffman: … revenue for G&A as we acquire the new marinas. That has been the practice of Safe Harbor. We continue to underwrite in that methodology. But in working closely with Baxter and Gavin, senior management at Safe Harbor, the addition of the Rybovich senior staff and back office is not so much of a have to have. It's a want of have. And so that's a perfect example where their skill set will be able to be spread over many of the existing Safe Harbor Marinas to be able to now take that superyacht ability to shift and provide services and ancillary revenues from other Safe Harbor Marinas to be able to deliver services back and forth, we think will incrementally grow the existing opportunities. And as we look to new opportunities, and there are several that I could point to in the pipeline, it is their skill set that is being levered to be able to really take a hard look at opportunities and create what we would call more strategic value post-acquisition that will benefit growth going forward. So I don't think you'll see the step. I think you see that we're there, and you'll see the incremental changes from where we are right now.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And Karen, the $23 million in business combination expenses that are excluded from core FFO. What specific costs are included in that? And are additional costs expected in 2021?\nKaren Dearing: No. So the $23 million of business combination costs are really the impact of the Safe Harbor Marinas being treated as a business com rather than an asset acquisition. So asset acquisitions, you capitalize cost business coms, you expense them. Those costs are just typical closing costs on real estate transactions. They are the legal costs associated with it. And the M&A advisory fees, those types of things. I think the amount in line with what you'd see on an M&A transaction of this size and they're not anticipated going forward. Most of our acquisitions are considered asset acquisitions. So those types of costs would be capitalized.\nGary Shiffman: And the only thing that I'd add to that, the complexity of marinas, they're being the uplands in the water. We did extensive diligence from an engineering standpoint to evaluate the uplands, the utilities, the waters, the wave attenuation complexities of the business, the seawalls. So more than we would be doing at an MH or RV transaction, even at that size. One-time costs.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Last one, if I may. Could you share the cap rate for Rybovich, just NOI? And then what it would be if you include their G&A load?\nGary Shiffman: What I can share is what I have in front of me. And I indicated for the 7 properties acquired, the cap rate range was from 6.4% to 8.5%. And Rybovich would be on the lower end of that.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then including G&A, what would the yield be?\nGary Shiffman: I'm sorry, I missed that.\nKaren Dearing: Including G&A, the yield would be?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. I don't have that in front of me, but you could definitely follow-up with Fernando.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Keegan Carl with Berenberg.\nKeegan Carl: So first, just given what's going on in Texas, have you guys heard of any reported damages either to your MH or RV or marina properties? And if so, how material of an impact do you think that will happen in the quarter?\nJohn McLaren: Hey. This is John. So I mean, we've been dealing with some of the power outages and things like that. But really, we haven't had -- other than a few broken pipes and things like that. They're really -- we feel fortunate as of right now within our communities and resorts in Texas that we haven't had more damage than we have. So we seem to be in pretty good shape right now.\nKeegan Carl: Okay. That's good to hear. And then shifting gears a little bit. If we look at resident move-outs in the MH and RV space, it looks like they ticked up to 3.3% for the year. What was the driver of this? And how quickly do you expect to fill these sites?\nJohn McLaren: Well, I think that on the RV side, it was really more to do with our conversions earlier in the course of the year. And we have gained a lot of that back towards the latter half of this year. On the MH side, I mean, what I can tell you is we've seen more homes on our -- particularly our brokered home sales business has grown considerably in more houses changing hands, which is good, and it's healthy for the community. So I think we're just seeing additional activity that's happening. But as I've shared in some of our earlier calls as well, what we may lose from an occupancy standpoint, we are seeing it overwhelmingly come back in terms of the application activity for new people to move in as well.\nOperator: Our next question is comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo.\nTodd Stender: Just to stay on the Rybovich deal, what were the terms on the new Series I preferred OP units, and how did that compare to the Series H?\nKaren Dearing: Well, that one I'm going to have to dig up.\nTodd Stender: But similar to a preferred OP unit, there's got to be a coupon, right?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. Yes. Yes.\nKaren Dearing: Yes. It a 3% coupon. The Series H was a 3% also.\nTodd Stender: And there's a lockup period or some type of hold period that converts to common at some point?\nJohn McLaren: There is. I don't think we have in front of it, but we'd be glad to share it with you.\nOperator: Our next question is come from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Just a follow-up. We talked a lot about superyacht and it made me think about how global that industry is. What's your appetite for international expansion on the marina side?\nGary Shiffman: That's a great question. I think that the seasonality that exists in that superyacht world of where both spend their time at different times of the year. I think it will be logical to look towards a sister marina in the areas of superyacht travel. And I think we have identified a couple that are under consideration and discussion based on the vast experience of the great team that we're getting along with Rybovich and their understanding of that superyacht business. So we won't be jumping and running anywhere soon, but I think that we will selectively look at an opportunity or 2 that matches against the -- generally, the Transatlantic traffic that exists out of Rybovich.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Interesting. So that sounds more like a Mediterranean expansion?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. Mediterranean would be the logical spot.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the call back over to management for any closing comments.\nGary Shiffman: Well, we'd like to thank everybody for participating on this call. We hope that everybody stays safe, and we look forward to speaking again after first quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

            "content": "Thanks, John. For the fourth quarter, Sun reported core FFO per share of $1.16, 5.5% above the prior year and $0.04 ahead of the top end of our guidance range. These results reflect better-than-expected performance from our ground-up developments and recently completed acquisitions, including Safe Harbor Marinas. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, core FFO per share was $5.09, up 3.5% from 2019. We are very pleased with our results and our positioning for 2021. During the year, we acquired almost $3 billion of operating properties, including the Safe Harbor Marinas portfolio. Subsequent to year-end, we acquired a manufactured housing community for redevelopment adjacent to an existing community, 2 RV resorts and 2 marinas for a combined $43 million.  We had an active year on the capital markets front, raising approximately $1.9 billion in equity to ensure the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet to support our acquisitions and growth initiatives. We ended 2020 with $4.8 billion of debt outstanding at a 3.4% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 9.4 years. We had $83 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio of 6.9 times. Pro forma leverage, including the estimated full year EBITDA contribution from Safe Harbor and other acquisitions, is in the mid-to-high 5 times EBITDA, which is in line with our long-term leverage target. Our performance in 2020 and the confidence we have in the ability to continue to generate industry-leading results provided the incentive for our Board to raise our 2021 distribution to $3.32 per share, up 5.1% from last year. This is our fifth consecutive annual distribution increase. Turning to guidance. For the year, we expect core FFO to be in the range of $5.79 to $5.95 per share, an increase of 15.3% at the midpoint. First quarter FFO is expected to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.17 per share. Moving to internal growth drivers. We are anticipating a 2021 same community NOI growth range of 5.6% to 6.6%, which includes a blended weighted average monthly rent increase of 3.4% for manufactured housing and annual RV. Our core FFO and same community NOI guidance assumes lower transient RV revenue contributions in the first quarter of approximately $8 million to $10 million due to the California shelter-in-place order, which ended in early February, and the extension of the Canadian border closure.  We expect revenue-producing site gains throughout the year to be between 2,150 and 2,350. On the development front, we plan to deliver 1,200 to 1,600 vacant expansion and ground-up development sites in 2021. For our marina business, we expect total NOI, inclusive of service and ancillary contributions, of $163 million to $169 million. With respect to our G&A guidance, we expect our 2021 G&A expense to be in the range of $164 million to $167 million. Approximately $33 million of the year-over-year increase is attributed to marinas as we scale that platform to capture and support the integration and operations of the large consolidation opportunity we see before us. As Safe Harbor transitions from a private operator to a wholly-owned subsidiary of a public company, it requires an expanded operating infrastructure and financial reporting structure to support both its regulatory obligations, primarily around reporting and future growth potential. This level of G&A supports both the operationally-intensive nature of the marina business as well as our expectation for the marina portfolio to be in high-growth mode over the next several years. In just our first 90 days of ownership, we've increased the marina portfolio's transaction value by over 20%. We want to ensure that the business and the team are set up for success and anticipate that marina-related G&A will be leveraged over time. It's important to note, there is seasonality in our portfolio. Please refer to our supplemental for additional disclosures on expected seasonality for total MH and RV NOI, marina NOI and core FFO. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. Finally, we'd like to note that starting with our first quarter earnings release, we intend to provide enhanced reporting disclosures in our supplemental across MH, RV and marinas. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator? I think as far as -- are you speaking of maybe in terms of COVID impact and things like that? We don't see much risk associated with that. I mean, the portfolio performed very well through COVID last year. So I don't really see much impact if that were to happen based on what happened last year. First year. Nick, what I'd say is that, as you mentioned, this -- the marina platform is independently operating. So we did absorb all of the executive team senior operations back office. And we did not underwrite any expected synergies or efficiencies with that platform. And if you think about that platform, it is -- it's scaling, right? It's growing very, very rapidly. It's not scaled yet. So I would think that we will leverage G&A over time, but I would not expect that near term. A 1/3. Revenue. No. So the $23 million of business combination costs are really the impact of the Safe Harbor Marinas being treated as a business com rather than an asset acquisition. So asset acquisitions, you capitalize cost business coms, you expense them. Those costs are just typical closing costs on real estate transactions. They are the legal costs associated with it. And the M&A advisory fees, those types of things. I think the amount in line with what you'd see on an M&A transaction of this size and they're not anticipated going forward. Most of our acquisitions are considered asset acquisitions. So those types of costs would be capitalized. Including G&A, the yield would be? Well, that one I'm going to have to dig up. Yes. It a 3% coupon. The Series H was a 3% also."

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results as well as our 2021 guidance. We hope that you and your families are in good health as we continue to navigate the challenges of the pandemic. We are very pleased with the resilience of our portfolio and the commitment and humanity of our team members during this most difficult time. The stable growth we delivered in the environment further demonstrates the strength of manufactured housing and RV resorts through economic cycles. It also underscores our rationale for meaningfully expanding our platform with the acquisition of Safe Harbor Marinas, a business that exhibits similar stability and growth characteristics. For the year, Sun generated core FFO per share growth of 3.5%. Same community NOI growth of 4% added over 2,500 revenue-producing sites and achieved total portfolio occupancy of 97.3%, a 90 basis point improvement over 2019. To drive additional future growth, we acquired almost $3 billion of properties in 2020. Over $600 million of our acquisitions took place in the fourth quarter after the closing of the Safe Harbor transaction. Total acquisitions for the year included 24 manufactured housing communities and RV resorts with over 6,900 sites and 106 marinas with nearly 39,000 wet slips and dry storage spaces. Additionally, post year-end, through the date of this call, we have closed acquisitions totaling over $43 million, including 1 manufactured housing community, 2 RV resorts and 2 marinas.  We are actively pursuing opportunities in each of our segments. Our extensive experience, track record and industry relationships have helped continue to facilitate successful MH and RV transactions. On the marina side, since the closing of the Safe Harbor transaction, we have added 7 additional marinas, inclusive of the world-class Rybovich superyacht marinas in West Palm Beach and Riviera Beach, Florida. The Rybovich team is joining Safe Harbor, and we expect them to drive incremental growth across the entire marina portfolio given the specialized nature of superyacht marina operations.  As we reflect on the events of 2020 and look optimistically to the future, we are encouraged by the fundamentals of our business. The demand for high-quality, affordable housing and vacationing is as strong as ever. Even with the various shelter-in-place restrictions throughout 2020 and into 2021, applications to live in a Sun community remain at an all-time high as we received almost 50,000 applications in 2020 and sold nearly 2,900 homes. Our RV resort performance remains strong as travelers who wanted an increased level of control and safety chose our resorts for some much-needed rest. We believe that RVing attracted a large number of first timers, as indicated by a 6% year-over-year growth in RV shipments, including an almost 50% increase in RV shipments for the month of December. We anticipate that many of those first timers are likely to be repeat customers in the years ahead. We see numerous similarities with respect to marinas as a wide portion of the population became first time boat owners as well. According to industry sources, there was a 35% increase in the number of purchases by first time boat buyers in 2020. In short, we expect there will be sustained demand across each of our business lines. As we look to operational initiatives for 2021, Sun is positioned to continue to execute on our 4 core investment strategies. The first is reinvestment in our properties to ensure sustained demand and to maintain the high-quality of our assets. Second is the pursuit of accretive acquisitions of operating manufactured housing communities, RV resorts and marinas. Our acquisition pipeline is as full as it has ever been. Sellers continue to see the benefits of a transaction with Sun given the certainty of execution, tax deferment strategies and the knowledge that Sun will improve and continue managing these assets to the highest possible standards. Our third investment strategy is the construction of expansion sites. And last is the construction of greenfield developments. Together, these 4 strategies support the long-term sustainability of delivering industry-leading growth. As our company has grown significantly, we have decided to expand the size of our Board and recently announced the appointment of Tonya Allen as an independent director. Tonya brings a wealth of experience and expertise in the fields of education and economic development and will be a tremendous asset to our team. We welcome Tonya and look forward to having her expert perspective on sustainability and social issues as part of our Board initiative and leadership moving forward. Our success would not be possible without the dedication and commitment of our team members, who continually place the highest priority on the health and safety of our residents and guests. Through the many challenges this past year, our team consistently rose to the occasion and worked tirelessly to produce these positive results. I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to the entire team as I am very proud of what we have been able to accomplish together. I will now turn the call over to John and Karen to discuss the results in further detail. So it's Gary. I think that we're very excited to participate in the first event that you described. And I think it is the beginning of trying to tie a very large membership consisting of close to 50,000 members in the marina right now to the ability to go from Safe Harbor to Safe Harbor Marinas and understand the expectation that one would have in visiting the consistency of how these marinas run and what the services they offer. So I think that this will be the first opportunity to really showcase that. And the Sun staff sitting in this room is as excited as anyone to really participate and really see what the safe harbor management has planned for the future. So with regard to that, we'll be able to share more, with regard to what the future holds in those types of events going forward. So kind of one of the first inaugural step-outs for Sun to participate in this type of safe harbor event. With regard to marina details and disclosures, what we wanted to share with everyone today is that we will be providing enhanced disclosure by business segmentation, and specifically for marinas, with our first quarter earnings release. So in doing so, we'll begin providing separate disclosure on our manufactured housing business line as well as separate disclosure on our RV business line in an effort to really provide insight into each of the 3 business lines. So I think it will be a -- first quarter, we'll have the opportunity to look a little bit more clearly into marinas and the business segmentation as well as helping everyone understand for their review and modeling purposes breaking apart MH and RV as well. So that will be coming first quarter, and we'll be better able to look into the segmentation of each. Yes. You didn't miss it. You didn't miss it. We didn't give it. We typically don't give guidance. We usually have forward acquisitions. We usually reference the previous year or the previous few years. Obviously, new with Safe Harbor Marinas acquisitions. But generally, we look forward to $100 million to $400 million of MH and RV acquisitions based on historical numbers, excluding large portfolios, which basically have already been consolidated. And then separately, we spoke about or I mentioned in my remarks that I can share that the acquisition pipeline really in manufactured housing, RV and marinas as absolutely as full as it's ever been. So we certainly have our work cut out for us. We are seeing increased competition in the MH and RV space. And it might not surprise many of you that we're starting to see increased competition in the marina space. So we will be very, very selective that anything we do acquire will be the highest of quality and the highest of opportunity to provide growth and value creation for our shareholders. And we're excited to work through that pipeline and be able to present exactly what we've accomplished each quarter. Yes. It's Gary again. I'll defer to first quarter, when we can really look a little bit deeper into segments of the business, but I would share with you that the Rybovich marina in both locations offers services to the world's largest boats. But when you get into it, the margins remain similar, but because of the unique offerings, the occupancy, the service requirements, which specialties draw in vessels and boats that are less sensitive to the cost of staying in the marina and provide all the ancillary revenue lead towards very good returns against the investment on a pretty predictable basis. So as you look out over a long period of time, the consistency of their growth of revenue is very comfortably predictable, so those are the characteristics of it. But within it, it's just high occupancy, high demand. Their slips can accommodate boats in excess of 300 feet. So it is really the world's largest boats and yachts and sail craft. And I can share with you, it's really a list of the who's who in marina yacht ownership as it's one of the few marinas that can culminate that size and scale of boats. Yes. I guess I would describe it that we expected some cap rate compression after our announcement, and there have been a couple of other platforms for sale over the last 12 months. And as we study them carefully and did our research and began to understand the stability of cash flow, the lack of new supply, the demand versus supply fundamentals, the growth in boat ownership, it doesn't come as a surprise to us. I think what does come as a little bit of a surprise as how fast the awareness of many other potential investors are queuing in, in the marina business. So we have heard both on a publicly announced basis and a private basis that there has been cap rate compression taking place. Certainly, marina is changing hands at a lower cap rate than the ability of the Safe Harbor group to generate higher cap rates. So that cap rate is creeping in. And the way I describe it right now is our view on the marinas is that they're trading at a 300 basis points to 400 basis points spread above where we're seeing many manufactured housing and RV communities trading at today. So still a good solid spread. And what I'd share is that the 7 marinas that were closed, including Rybovich, traded in the range of a 6.4% to 8.5% cap rate thus far. Our second quarter bookings, John? Yes, MH is all annual contracts. So we've seen how it performed in 2020, so. But for the impact on the Canadian borders John covered and the California closures that are now up in February, we are feeling very comfortable with how 2021 should play out just based on what we saw in 2020. That conversion gets us a 40% to 60% per site revenue increase on an annual basis. So... First year. So those conversions are very important to us. There's a part of our strategy that seeks to buy transient just as we seek to buy vacancy in our manufactured housing communities because it's an absolute tremendous first year benefit when, A, we get the sites filled and manufactured housing; and B, when we convert the transient. So you will find us stepping up our conversion programs as we get more and more inventory of the transient sites going forward. We're excited to demonstrate to the market and our shareholders growth on the marina side, if you're referencing the marina side, I think that part of the excitement by the Safe Harbor management and operational team is the ability to have a strong, well-capitalized partner to enhance and grow the business. So I think the opportunity ahead of us to create increased cap rate, which will generate into a greater IRR over a, call it, a 3 to 5 to 7-year period of time with additional, I think, contraction of cap rate, which will naturally enter in over a period of time. I think the exit cap rates in this particular asset class will be modeled probably more aggressive than the entry if our strategy proves out. And so the IRRs are very, very strong. Yes. I would say that the capital will go out similarly where we can justify the return we're going to get on it. But due to the ability to buy at a higher cap rate and the strategy and the supposition, as we said, that there'll be cap rate contraction. Then on paper at least, the IRRs grow a little bit faster on the marina side. That's a great question, Wes. Certainly, both the Sun management and Safe Harbor management when we explored the transaction, both were excited about the opportunity to create a tax-deferred security to be able to unlock the acquisition of marinas that might not otherwise be available. As I know Baxter and the Safe Harbor management have shared on some of our calls, many of these marinas are second and third generation. So the tax recapture and the tax ramifications and the fact that they generally won't qualify for 1031 exchanges, I think, lead us to believe that we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. I think Rybovich is an excellent example of where -- do you recall the exact percentage there of securities? 30? Okay. A 1/3 of it was actually a combination of preferred operating partnership units and operating partnership units. And the Huizenga family really was aligned and wanting to protect the tax implications and obviously defer the impacts. But at the same time, as I mentioned earlier in our remarks, we're really excited to have that entire team with their experience in the superyacht marina world as part of the Safe Harbor team. So not only do the tax securities become important to acquire the property, but in this case, we acquired a management team, relationships in the industry and core competencies that are just going to enhance safe harbor's efforts moving forward. So there's a lot of benefits from having those securities. Yes. These are all coming to me. I get the operational questions out here to John. It's a great question. And today, we have about 8,400 sites in various stages of predevelopment, okay? 9 manufactured housing communities, 8 RV communities, 2 hybrids. That are hybrids for us are a combination of manufactured housing and RV in a single development. So as we kind of shared, we've been the largest consolidator of manufactured housing communities over the last 10 years or so. And we began to ramp up our efforts on new community development, especially as we saw the severe compression in cap rates, no new supply coming on and having the experience at Sun Communities -- being a developer of new communities initially. We determined that we could start developing communities at better returns than acquiring the existing communities at these compressed cap rates. So today, we'll continue acquiring existing communities where we think the cap rates justify and the growth justified it. But you'll continue to see a focus on development as we think we can generate high single-digit returns upon stabilization, which generally looks to be 3 to 5 years after the construction begins, depending if it's RV or MH. Really too early to tell. We're watching it carefully and everyone is. There's a lot of discussion out there. Certainly, a lot of discussion on the HUD front and the continued commentary to focus on affordable or obtainable housing by the government agencies, but we're yet to see any meaningful shift towards anything. John, that really is a great question. And obviously, as we prepared for budgeting for the acquisition of Safe Harbor and to discuss guidance, we tried to be very, very transparent in our G&A, and we ask that question ourselves, even during the underwriting. This should be very scalable. We do underwrite to a approximately 3% of... ... revenue for G&A as we acquire the new marinas. That has been the practice of Safe Harbor. We continue to underwrite in that methodology. But in working closely with Baxter and Gavin, senior management at Safe Harbor, the addition of the Rybovich senior staff and back office is not so much of a have to have. It's a want of have. And so that's a perfect example where their skill set will be able to be spread over many of the existing Safe Harbor Marinas to be able to now take that superyacht ability to shift and provide services and ancillary revenues from other Safe Harbor Marinas to be able to deliver services back and forth, we think will incrementally grow the existing opportunities. And as we look to new opportunities, and there are several that I could point to in the pipeline, it is their skill set that is being levered to be able to really take a hard look at opportunities and create what we would call more strategic value post-acquisition that will benefit growth going forward. So I don't think you'll see the step. I think you see that we're there, and you'll see the incremental changes from where we are right now. And the only thing that I'd add to that, the complexity of marinas, they're being the uplands in the water. We did extensive diligence from an engineering standpoint to evaluate the uplands, the utilities, the waters, the wave attenuation complexities of the business, the seawalls. So more than we would be doing at an MH or RV transaction, even at that size. One-time costs. What I can share is what I have in front of me. And I indicated for the 7 properties acquired, the cap rate range was from 6.4% to 8.5%. And Rybovich would be on the lower end of that. I'm sorry, I missed that. Yes. I don't have that in front of me, but you could definitely follow-up with Fernando. That's a great question. I think that the seasonality that exists in that superyacht world of where both spend their time at different times of the year. I think it will be logical to look towards a sister marina in the areas of superyacht travel. And I think we have identified a couple that are under consideration and discussion based on the vast experience of the great team that we're getting along with Rybovich and their understanding of that superyacht business. So we won't be jumping and running anywhere soon, but I think that we will selectively look at an opportunity or 2 that matches against the -- generally, the Transatlantic traffic that exists out of Rybovich. Yes. Mediterranean would be the logical spot. Well, we'd like to thank everybody for participating on this call. We hope that everybody stays safe, and we look forward to speaking again after first quarter. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Our solid performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 demonstrate the resilience of our operations across manufactured housing, RV resorts and marinas. We benefited from heightened demand for our RV resorts in the second half of the year and the steadiness of manufactured housing through all of 2020. Our same community results reflect the stability of the platform as we work through the challenges of the pandemic. For the fourth quarter, same community NOI increased by 2.1%. Excluding direct COVID-19-related expenses of $300,000, our same community NOI growth would have been 2.4%. In the fourth quarter, same community NOI was driven by a 5.7% growth in revenues, reflecting a 3.8% increase in weighted average monthly rent and a 180 basis point occupancy gain. Breaking it down further, manufactured housing revenues grew by 4.8%, annual RV grew by 1.9% and transient RV grew by almost 18%. If it were not for the mandated closures of our resorts in California starting in December as well as the continued Canadian travel restrictions, our fourth quarter transient RV results would have been even stronger. The good news is that travel restrictions were lifted in California at the beginning of February, and we have already begun to welcome our guests to these resorts. Expenses in the fourth quarter were elevated predominantly due to the costs associated with the pandemic, along with higher payroll, supply and repairs and utilities at RV resorts had at extended seasons. For the full year, same community NOI increased 4%. Excluding $2.4 million of direct COVID-related expenses, same community NOI would have increased by 4.4%. This growth reflects a 3.6% revenue increase and a 3% increase in same community expenses. The revenue growth was primarily driven by a 4.5% increase in annual RV revenues and 5.6% growth from manufactured housing revenues. Same community transient RV revenues were down 5% for the year, reflecting the delayed opening of 44 of our seasonal resorts due to COVID-related travel restrictions in the late spring and early summer. Our RV transient business saw a meaningful rebound with same community transient RV revenues growing by 5% in the third quarter and 17.8% in the fourth quarter as compared to the same periods of 2019. Our RV property performance will be affected in the first quarter by the California shelter-in-place order that ran through the early part of February. Additionally, the continued Canadian border closure has prevented some of our guests from returning to our Southern resorts for the season. Combined these 2 events are estimated to have an impact of $8 million to $10 million to transient RV revenues, which is reflected in our first quarter and annual 2021 guidance.  Even as the impact of the pandemic persists, forward bookings for the second quarter are pacing meaningfully ahead with current on the books revenues 18% above this time last year. From a total portfolio perspective, we gained 578 revenue-producing sites for the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to over 2,500. The addition of these sites increased our total portfolio occupancy to 97.3% from 96.4% a year ago. Of our revenue-producing site gains for the year, 1,070 or roughly 43%, were in our manufactured housing expansion communities.  For the year, 863 transient RV sites were converted to annual leases. The development of ground-up and expansion sites is a consistent growth driver for us. In 2020, we delivered over 1,300 vacant ground-up and expansion sites. These recently completed expansion ground-up development sites will contribute to growth in 2021 and beyond as they fill up and stabilize. Additionally, we currently have over 10,000 zoned and entitled sites in our portfolio for expansion and ground-up developments, which, when developed, should contribute to our growth in future years. Moving on to home sales. We sold 782 homes for the quarter and 2,866 homes for the year. 850 of these home sales were conversions of renters to owners in 2020. We saw new home gross profit expansion of 3.6% year-over-year, driven by strong margins in Colorado, Connecticut and Ontario.  For the year, average home sales prices rose for both new and preowned homes by 11.3% and 8.8%, respectively. The new home sales and our ground-up and redevelopments in Colorado and Florida contributed to this increase. Brokered home sales throughout Sun's portfolio saw a 15% increase in total sales year-over-year as the resale market was strong as ever. Average brokered home prices in our communities increased by over 21% in 2020. A healthy resale market is very important for our success as new and existing residents see the value of choosing to live in a Sun community given the quality and level of ongoing reinvestment that goes into our properties. Sun has maintained strong rent collection rates throughout 2020. Total rent collection rates for manufactured housing communities and annual RVs for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 were over 96% and 97%, respectively, after adjusting for the impact of COVID-19-related hardship deferrals and prepaid rent balances. January collections were over 97% for both manufactured housing and annual RV. Through February 16, we have collected 95% for both our manufactured housing communities and for our annual RVs, which is consistent with prior year collections. With respect to Safe Harbor, we closed our acquisition on October 30, 2020. The fourth quarter performance was solid with a 2-month NOI contribution of $17.9 million. COVID-related tailwinds like the surge of new boat ownership, which Gary discussed, helped drive strong wet slip rental and on land winter storage revenue. Given the ability to enjoy the outdoors in a safe and self-control environment, we anticipate marinas to be an important growth driver for the coming years. In closing, 2020 posed both numerous challenges and opportunities for Sun. We have grown as an organization and are stronger than ever. We are proud of our team members' dedication to our residents and guests and are grateful for their efforts in a truly challenging year. Karen will now discuss our financial results. Karen? Yes. I mean on the RV side, our second quarter and third quarter, bookings are pacing ahead of last year. So as I shared in my remarks, I mean, it's just -- it's that -- what Gary has talked about the whole time is there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for people wanting to get outdoors. And the RV asset class, along with the marine asset class, really serve that purpose. So we're really pretty excited about what we see going forward, John. Well, we converted 863 transient guests over to annual leases last year, which is pretty close to what we do on an annual basis. And so I think we're really pleased with that performance. And -- but I would say the bigger part of that, John, has been the development that we have done that's added to that denominator of transient sites that we have in our portfolio, which, of course, are future transient conversion opportunities to annual leases. A 1/3 of it. Wes, this is John. So no, I mean, no real impact for Sun as far as that's concerned. It's more -- I think some of it really has to do with a simple fact that, as we've shared, we've always been, on average, over at least the last 20 years, rent increases in the 2% to 4% range. We do have some rent control communities in California that are pure rent control, but it's really a smaller part of our portfolio. And the fact that we've always managed that rent increase between 2% to 4%. What I'm seeing out there and what I've heard in various locations, even if we have a single community in a particular state, that a lot of that dialogue, frankly, is sort of within our range that we would be doing anyway. So it doesn't really have a tremendous impact on us at this point. The other thing I'd add, Wes, like some of the numbers that Gary just shared with you in terms of what we have in various stages of entitlement on development is, I think, that we are in a bit of a unique position just because we have constructed 7 ground-up developments now over the last 3 years. And so when I'm going to these meetings with various municipalities and planning commissions and that sort of thing, I'm no longer showing renderings of what we can do. I'm showing what we've actually done. And so with the dialogue from Washington, which is important about attainability and affordability, we're very well able to demonstrate how we play so well into that -- into helping with that crisis. Hey. This is John. So I mean, we've been dealing with some of the power outages and things like that. But really, we haven't had -- other than a few broken pipes and things like that. They're really -- we feel fortunate as of right now within our communities and resorts in Texas that we haven't had more damage than we have. So we seem to be in pretty good shape right now. Well, I think that on the RV side, it was really more to do with our conversions earlier in the course of the year. And we have gained a lot of that back towards the latter half of this year. On the MH side, I mean, what I can tell you is we've seen more homes on our -- particularly our brokered home sales business has grown considerably in more houses changing hands, which is good, and it's healthy for the community. So I think we're just seeing additional activity that's happening. But as I've shared in some of our earlier calls as well, what we may lose from an occupancy standpoint, we are seeing it overwhelmingly come back in terms of the application activity for new people to move in as well. Yes. Yes. Yes. There is. I don't think we have in front of it, but we'd be glad to share it with you."

A question-and-answer session will begin after the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now like to turn the conference over to your host, Gary Shiffman. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Thank you, operator. Good morning. And thank you for joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results and provide an update on the continuing impact of COVID-19. We hope that you and your families are staying healthy and managing through this challenging time. We're now in our 7th month of navigating the pandemic, and we are pleased to share that our performance continues to exceed our expectations. Our commitment to the safety of our residents, guests, and team members remains our top priority, and we are balancing this responsibility with our pledge to deliver Sun's signature service throughout our communities and resorts. In addition to the solid performance delivered in our manufactured housing and RV portfolios, we are excited to further expand and enhance our platform with the pending acquisition of Safe Harbor Marinas. Safe Harbor brings a high-quality rental revenue stream, adds diversity in terms of geography and customer base, and is expected to further enhance Sun's earnings growth potential over the long term. We are pleased with our results for the third quarter as our RV portfolio continued to build reservation momentum on a week-over-week basis and manufactured housing continued to see increased demand given the need for affordable housing. We outperformed initial expectations discussed during our second quarter earnings call in July, primarily due to the strong performance of our transient RV business and related ancillary income generated at our resorts. Our third quarter forecast guided to a net reduction due to the impact from the virus of up to $15 million from our original budget. As the quarter progressed, we continued to perform better than forecast expectations and ultimately outperformed our forecast by approximately $20 million. RVing [ph] proved to be a preferred method of vacationing across the country, due in large part to the ability for travelers to drive to and more safely vacation in our resorts, enjoying the outdoor lifestyle while remaining socially distanced. Our reported core FFO per share was $1.60 for the third quarter, 9.6% ahead of last year. The 5.5% same community NOI growth delivered in the third quarter underscores the resiliency of our platform and the demand for our product. In the quarter, we grew same community occupancy 200 basis points to 98.8%. Additionally, during the third quarter, we deployed approximately $205 million in the acquisition of two manufactured housing communities and five RV resorts, totaling approximately 2,500 developed sites and an additional 109 expansion sites. The majority of these acquisitions came to us through our long-standing industry relationships. Our pipeline of single assets and small portfolios and manufactured housing and RV is as full as ever. So is continuing to see the benefits of the transaction with Sun, given certainty of execution, tax deferment strategies and the knowledge that Sun will improve and continue managing these assets to the best possible standards. We also completed the construction of approximately 685 sites across our expansions, ground up, and redevelopment projects, bringing total development sites delivered for the year to almost 1,200 and 11 communities and resorts in nine states. On September 29th, we announced the pending acquisition of Safe Harbor Marinas for $2.1 billion. This acquisition will serve to expand our loyal customer base, diversify our geographic footprint, and add incremental revenue streams, which we believe will strengthen our ability to generate industry-leading growth over the long term. We are very excited about Safe Harbor Marinas and look forward to welcoming the entire Safe Harbor team to the Sun family. We anticipate that this acquisition will close at the end of this month. We have not lost sight of the potential impact of the virus and the hardship that it has accompanied the pandemic across the country. Overall, we believe that Sun has been a net beneficiary as a consequence of customer behavior, the demand for our homes, and the safety of our vacation properties. As we have said in the prior two quarters, we did not know the duration or the ultimate impact on the economy or our operations. Thus far, we have proven our ability to navigate the environment and successfully execute our business strategy. Throughout the pandemic, our team has worked tirelessly to serve our residents and guests and produce the results we're discussing with you today. The team has demonstrated an ability to adapt while maintaining Sun's high customer service standards that are central to the business. I would like to thank each one of our team members for going above and beyond in contributing to our outstanding results. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results in more detail. John?\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. Our results in the third quarter speak to the resilience of our platform as we outperformed our forecasted expectations across all of our revenue streams. From a total portfolio perspective, we gained 776 revenue-producing sites, a 1.3% increase boosting total occupancy to 97.2%, up 50 basis points from last year. This now brings our year-to-date revenue-producing site gains to approximately 1,930 sites putting us within striking distance of achieving our original RPS gain budget for 2020. The demand for our communities and resorts is stronger than ever. Manufactured housing revenue producing site gains totaled 1,400 sites, or 72% of total site gains year-to-date. 910 of these gains were in manufactured housing expansion communities. The balance of the RPS gains, or 530 sites, came from conversions of transient RV sites to annual leases. Our same community portfolio NOI for the third quarter rose 5.5%, resulting from a 5.4% increase in revenues and a 5.2% increase in operating expenses, which included $1.1 million of PPE-related expenses. Adjusting for our PPE expense, same community NOI growth would have been 6.2%. Our weighted average rental rate increase was 3.6% for the portfolio with manufactured housing at 3.2% and annual RV at 5.5%. Same community manufactured housing revenues increased by 5.4%, driven by the discussed 3.2% rental rate increase and occupancy gains over the last 12 months. Same community annual RV revenues increased by 3.6% and transient RV revenues rose by 5%. On the expense side, while we no longer have team members on furlough, we did have payroll savings due to the delayed hiring for seasonal positions. Our rental program continues to perform well. In the quarter we had a 9% increase in applications to rent the home from Sun and our rental home renewal rate was 67%. Consistent with renewal trends experienced during the second quarter. These renewal rates are 10% better than historical averages. For the quarter total applications to live in a Sun committee, inclusive of sales rose 12% year-over-year. Moving to rent collection, manufactured housing and annual RV collections continue to be strong with MH at approximately 97% and RV at approximately 98%. Month-to-date collections for October are consistent with historical results. These strong collection figures underscore the fundamental strength and stability of our balanced portfolio of manufactured housing and RV communities. With regard to home sales, in the third quarter, we sold 710 homes compared to 906 homes last year. We had less pre-owned inventory to sell as a result of higher renewal rates and longer resident tenure. New home sales revenue grew 20% and our gross margin expanded 3.5% in the quarter to 18.7%. This was driven by a 29% increase in our average new home price of $153,000. New home sales, many of which are in our ground-up developments and expansions, are concentrated in Colorado, Florida, and South Carolina, and have higher-than-average new home prices and gross sales margins. Interesting to note, our brokered home sales are up 37% in the quarter, indicating continued strong demand in our communities, which has also contributed to less inventory for sale. Our RV business, particularly our transient RV business, experienced heightened demand supporting our thesis about travel preferences during the pandemic. We experienced a consistent build in weekly demand with record visits to our websites and calls to our reservation centers. Anecdotally, our Instagram following has grown fourfold over the last four months. As previously discussed, we saw an acceleration in the recovery of our transient RV business throughout the summer once stay-at-home restrictions were lifted in our communities. To demonstrate the velocity of the recovery, recall that the third quarter started with the Fourth of July weekend where our same community transient RV revenues were down approximately 5% on a year-over-year basis, as travel had just started to pick up. Fast forward to Labor Day, our revenues were up 5.4% on a year-over-year basis. Transient RV revenues for the month of September ended up being 32% better than our original budget. This strength is carrying into the fourth quarter, and we are anticipating a high single-digit revenue increase over last year. We remain optimistic in our demand outlook given the increasing popularity of RV vacationing. Our experience thus far with the impact that pandemic has reinforced our confidence in the durability of our cash flows and the strength of our portfolio and our strategy. I would now like to turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial results and balance sheet. Karen?\nKaren Dearing: Thank you, John. I will be reviewing our financial results followed by a discussion of our balance sheet, our capital markets activities and our expectations for the fourth quarter. For the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we reported $1.60 per share in core funds from operations, as compared to $1.46 last year. During the third quarter, we acquired seven properties for approximately $205 million. The acquisitions are comprised of two manufactured home communities with approximately 1200 sites and 5 RV resorts with approximately 1300 sites and just over 100 sites available for expansion. The properties are located in California, Florida, Michigan and Texas. As previously communicated, on September 29, we announced the acquisition of Safe Harbor Marinas for $2.1 billion, including the assumption of approximately $800 million of unsecured debt. We intend to run Safe Harbor as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun, retaining the existing management team and its infrastructure. The acquisition is expected to close on October 30. To support the Safe Harbor investment and maintain a flexible balance sheet, on September 30th, we launched an equity offering for 5.6 million shares. Due to strong demand, the offering was subsequently upsize to 9.2 million shares, including the greenshoe, which allowed us to raise approximately $1.3 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, we had $102.4 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $3.3 billion in debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 3.86% and a weighted average maturity of 11.4 years. Our net debt to trailing 12 month recurring EBITDA ratio at September 30 was 5 times. The pandemic and its financial and operational implications continue to be a fluid situation. However, with that said, and with the expectation that current operational conditions continue, we are providing a forecast range for fourth quarter core FFO per share. Based on our current estimates, we anticipate core FFO for the fourth quarter to be between $1.08 and $1.12 per share. When added to our actual results for the first three quarters, it implies the core FFO per share range of $5.02 to $5.06 for 2020. This forecast range includes, but is not limited to the latest revenue expectations for our transient RV portfolio, the estimated two month contribution from Safe Harbor and the impact of our equity raises and other financing activities. It does not include any prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our prepared remarks. We would like to open the call now for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be with Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And appreciate you providing fourth quarter guidance. So you'll have the two months of the Safe Harbor that will hit the fourth quarter. And I think previously you talked about a 6.7% year one cap rate. I'm wondering if you can walk through the seasonality of that, particularly for these winter months, November, December, and into the beginning of the year, and how that 6.7% plays out over the four quarters.\nKaren Dearing: Sure, Nick. So, yeah, obviously, we're highly active in the pursuit of industry-leading results. So we realized there are a lot of moving parts to creating FFO estimates between COVID impact pluses and minuses, contributions from acquisition, share count changes from equity raises, seasonality, just to name a few of the items going into that high-speed blender. For the Safe Harbor portfolio, there is seasonality in it. So based on our underwritten EBITDA, the fourth quarter typically contributes about 16% to 18% of full-year EBITDA rather than a pro rata 25%. November and December for the month that will be in our portfolio in 2020, those months contribute 7% to 8% of EBITDA. For full year, since Safe Harbor is just in the process of creating their 2021 budget, as are we, I'll provide some quarterly seasonality based on our underwriting. So their seasonality is similar to our MH and RV portfolio, but it's even more heavily weighted to Q3 and Q2. So, seasonality is generally in Q1 15% to 17% of EBITDA, Q2 30% to 32%, Q3 35% to 37%, and Q4 is 16% to 18%. And so we're busy putting together 2021 information, and we look forward to providing some additional information on that seasonality when we provide our 2021 guidance.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just on the transient RV, given the travel restrictions with Canada, how big of a risk do you see that and what's the ability right now do you think to backfill with any sort of domestic demand?\nJohn McLaren: Hey, Nick, it's John. Good morning. Well, I think the first obvious thing is they all want to come down and get out of the cold. Okay, there's no question. And I think that a lot of people are focused on whether or not the border will open, but I think it's important to break it out into two parts. First really is the transient business and looking back on our seasonality on that. Canadian guests only represent about 5% of our yearly transient budget, and so when you look at like Q4, that represents less than 1% of that. But with snowboard season coming, as you might expect, we've been working on executing on plans and campaigns for months to help secure any potential softness that may come in demand, inclusive of having elevated campaign segmentation targeted more to U.S. guests. At this point in time, I can tell you I'm very comfortable with the proactiveness the team has had and the strategy we've employed over the last four months to offset any potential Canadian business decline domestically. With respect to annuals, which is the other component of that, I think, really, their homes are in our communities, and like I said, they want to come down to their winter homes. We've spoken with many of them. They still plan to come down, and in fact, some even might come sooner to enjoy the winter warmth. And I think it's important to note also that our annual guests are all under lease contracts for their homes located in our communities, and we have developed and implemented a number of strategies to help support those folks that may not be able to come down at least as early as they want. We could see some shifts where maybe some of those annuals might come down. Maybe they can't come down in December or maybe they can't come down in January, but maybe they come down in February, March, April, and stay a little longer as well. So all in all, I feel very confident with what we're doing from a marketing and strategic perspective to recapture any potential offset we might have.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nJohn McLaren: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Good morning. You had a very strong growth in third quarter. Your fourth quarter guidance is basically flat year over year. And, John, you mentioned you have high-single digit growth expectations in RVs for the fourth quarter. So I'm wondering why the fourth quarter guidance was relatively modest.\nKaren Dearing: I think it's primarily due to the expectations of the Safe Harbor contribution. As I mentioned a little bit earlier, when I look at the rest of the portfolio exempting Safe Harbor, between I think the partial year contribution from our acquisitions along with the expected transient RV and vacation rental and ancillary contributions that will be very strong, along with higher even broker commissions. Those items are basically offsetting any sort of negative COVID impact that we might have to manufactured housing rents, based on delayed or lowered rent increases, annual RV impacts or even our home sales impacts.\nJohn Kim: Okay. I mean, third quarter was up almost 10% year over year. So an ex the core business, I would assume a lot of that would carry over into the fourth quarter. So is it really the ancillary revenue that's going to come down or I can't imagine Safe Harbor alone is going to bring down that growth for the remainder of the year.\nKaren Dearing: There's not an anticipation that ancillary will be a negative to the fourth quarter.\nJohn Kim: Okay.\nJohn McLaren: I think Karen covered in her earlier remarks, there are a lot of pieces going into fourth quarter and beyond post Safe Harbor. So we do look forward to closing the transaction at the end of the month and being able to share guidance. But sharing the seasonality I hope will be very helpful as you build your models. But the sensitivity of fourth quarter is absolutely lowest in the RV transient as well. So it represents about 15%. So it's not going to be as strong as it was in third quarter.\nKaren Dearing: And just overall, Q4 is lower for the core portfolio just based on our own internal seasonality and the way transient business impacts that.\nJohn Kim: Back in September, you gave the bookings indication of forward bookings up 20% in transient RV. I was wondering if you had that same figure for the next couple months.\nJohn McLaren: Yeah, I mean, October is solidly up year over year. And like we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do expect the highest single-digit growth for Q4. That's about the best outlook I can give you for the fourth quarter at this point in time, John. You know, but I would say that looking out beyond that, again, that's something that we really need to include when we release guidance here in the fourth quarter.\nJohn Kim: Okay. I was wondering if you could quantify your Canadian customers as your percentage of RV revenue, either for the year or particularly the fourth quarter and first quarter, typically.\nJohn McLaren: Yeah. Annual represents about -- Canadians represent about 7.6% of annual revenue and transient is 5.1% from Canada.\nJohn Kim: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nJohn McLaren: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey, guys. I'm curious on what you expect to do maybe on a forward basis as far as marina acquisitions. I think it looks like the Safe Harbor has done about 10 marina acquisitions a year over the last two years. Just curious what your early thoughts are there.\nKaren Dearing: I think from a capital allocation perspective, on the marina side, I think initial expectations are in the $200 million to $300 million range. And just looking forward for the company overall, I think we're going to continue to deploy capital in the MH and RV space, although it's getting tougher. Our long-term relationships are tax-advantageous structures and our trusted name recognition really continues to bear fruit for acquisition opportunities, evidenced by over $300 million in acquisitions so far this year. And we have a very robust pipeline. And outside of the large portfolio transactions, we've been able to typically deploy between $250 million and $300 million in acquisitions per year. And besides that, we'll continue to deploy long-term growth capital on expansions and developments.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Thanks, Karen. Maybe one follow up. When you guys are underwriting or maybe when you're thinking about your capital budget for marinas, what kind of CapEx load are you underwriting to? Is it like 5% of NOI or, I don't know, just throwing out a number there just to see how do you guys think about it and how might that compare to MH or RV?\nJohn McLaren: Yeah, it's very, very similar. I think that when we sat down and did our underwriting, and as Baxter shared on some of our early calls when we announced the deal. Interestingly enough, when you divide their entire CapEx on a per slip [ph] basis, it was approximately $250 per site. Karen's correcting me.\nKaren Dearing: No, it was $250. It was $250. And it's interesting that ours is between $250 and $300 a site, 300 sites, so pretty close to what we experienced.\nJohn McLaren: So very similar to our industry. And I think it just, again, underpins how much similarity there are. Certainly there are differences between the marinas, the customers, the business. But the core fundamentals, as we've talked about, supply, demand, all the things that MH and RV are known for are similar. And then working through the CapEx, it was a pleasant surprise for us to see it very similar to our existing core business.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Great. Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Karen.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.\nJohn Pawlowski: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the time. John, as you've gone and reinstated the rental increases on the MH side, could you give us a sense for the average rate you're sending out today? And how that may differ around that average by markets to come up what's the low and what's the high looking like?\nJohn McLaren: Yeah. I think we might have shared this before. But we had temporarily halted our rent increases in the spring, I think you know. And in response to the unprecedented impact of COVID, when we reinstated those increases, we elected to do it at a lower rate to both aid and supporting our loyal residents and to better secure occupancy and long-term success of the business for all Sun stakeholders. So I think right now we're right about we're averaging 3.2%, and we would expect that to finish out 2020 at about 3%, John.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Within the portfolio, what's the weakest market? Are rental rates falling anywhere?\nJohn McLaren: No. There's nothing that really stands out, John? No, because of the demand that we've got throughout the country, we've applied it on a pretty consistent basis throughout the portfolio.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, thanks. And last one for me I guess for anybody. Trying to wrap my head around the environmental risk for some of the marinas, maybe namely the lake-focused marinas and less about the economy but more floods, droughts, and the like. Historically, have there been assets you've acquired in recent years where just the boating season is largely gone because of environmental factors and revenue plummets? Just how do you think through the volatility associated with the environmental impacts on some of the marinas?\nGary Shiffman: It's Gary, John. And it's a good question and a question that we really spend time on and diligence on during our underwriting of both Safe Harbor and the other marina opportunities that we've looked at over the last four years or so. And I think that one of the things that attracted us to Safe Harbor was their outlook on what they are inclined to want to bring into their platform and what they are inclined not to want to or exclude from their acquisition horizons. And we got comfortable with the fact that the current portfolio and the acquisition objectives take into account as best they can, both historical indications of what have happened, mostly title wise, as well as droughts. And they've focused on the big water opportunities and the coastal opportunities. Certainly, there is future climate risk throughout the marina business and all assets, however you look at those risks with regard to hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, floods, title issues. But the existing portfolio we feel has really been scrutinized and hand selected well. So to the best of our underwriting ability, we think it's the best the best marinas to own, insulated as much as possible from the environmental issues.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. In recent years, how many assets, if any, have lost considerable amount of just the demand in a year due to environmental issue? Have there been any?\nGary Shiffman: There are none that I'm aware of. That being said, there have been adjustments made to docks and things like that, fixed docks are now floating docks. And that capital has been invested in areas where they've seen a benefit to putting the floating docks in. And as an industry common, I think that's the way of the future, if you will, where the fixed moorings become less and less frequent than the floating moorings, which interestingly enough, much of it is done with floating concrete. A lot of air is injected into that concrete. And I think that's the forward direction of most marinas.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nSamir Khanal: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Gary, just curious if you can give some color around the ancillary revenue side. It was very strong in the quarter. What's sort of boosting that number? Is it certainly younger age cohort and how should we think about that over the next 12 months considering that the Safe Harbor as also I think it's about a 10% component to ancillary revenue as well.\nJohn McLaren: Yeah. Samir, this is John. Hey, hey, I think it's primarily as a result of the reservation activity that we've had. We've just simply had more people come into our resorts which drives that ancillary business at the same time.\nKaren Dearing: Inclusive of vacation rental.\nJohn McLaren: Yeah, inclusive of…\nKaren Dearing: The cottage and vacation rental.\nJohn McLaren: Yeah.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. And you think it's sustainable as we think about sort of modeling '21 in numbers at this point with kind of the growth you're seeing?\nJohn McLaren: Yeah.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks so much.\nJohn McLaren: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.\nGary Shiffman: Well, we thank you again for joining us today, and we believe Sun has demonstrated its durability and resiliency during these challenging times. We look forward to sharing additional information with you and guidance on our fourth quarter call. Thank you. Be safe.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

            "name": "Karen Dearing",
            "content": "Thank you, John. I will be reviewing our financial results followed by a discussion of our balance sheet, our capital markets activities and our expectations for the fourth quarter. For the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we reported $1.60 per share in core funds from operations, as compared to $1.46 last year. During the third quarter, we acquired seven properties for approximately $205 million. The acquisitions are comprised of two manufactured home communities with approximately 1200 sites and 5 RV resorts with approximately 1300 sites and just over 100 sites available for expansion. The properties are located in California, Florida, Michigan and Texas. As previously communicated, on September 29, we announced the acquisition of Safe Harbor Marinas for $2.1 billion, including the assumption of approximately $800 million of unsecured debt. We intend to run Safe Harbor as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun, retaining the existing management team and its infrastructure. The acquisition is expected to close on October 30. To support the Safe Harbor investment and maintain a flexible balance sheet, on September 30th, we launched an equity offering for 5.6 million shares. Due to strong demand, the offering was subsequently upsize to 9.2 million shares, including the greenshoe, which allowed us to raise approximately $1.3 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, we had $102.4 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $3.3 billion in debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 3.86% and a weighted average maturity of 11.4 years. Our net debt to trailing 12 month recurring EBITDA ratio at September 30 was 5 times. The pandemic and its financial and operational implications continue to be a fluid situation. However, with that said, and with the expectation that current operational conditions continue, we are providing a forecast range for fourth quarter core FFO per share. Based on our current estimates, we anticipate core FFO for the fourth quarter to be between $1.08 and $1.12 per share. When added to our actual results for the first three quarters, it implies the core FFO per share range of $5.02 to $5.06 for 2020. This forecast range includes, but is not limited to the latest revenue expectations for our transient RV portfolio, the estimated two month contribution from Safe Harbor and the impact of our equity raises and other financing activities. It does not include any prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our prepared remarks. We would like to open the call now for questions. Operator? Sure, Nick. So, yeah, obviously, we're highly active in the pursuit of industry-leading results. So we realized there are a lot of moving parts to creating FFO estimates between COVID impact pluses and minuses, contributions from acquisition, share count changes from equity raises, seasonality, just to name a few of the items going into that high-speed blender. For the Safe Harbor portfolio, there is seasonality in it. So based on our underwritten EBITDA, the fourth quarter typically contributes about 16% to 18% of full-year EBITDA rather than a pro rata 25%. November and December for the month that will be in our portfolio in 2020, those months contribute 7% to 8% of EBITDA. For full year, since Safe Harbor is just in the process of creating their 2021 budget, as are we, I'll provide some quarterly seasonality based on our underwriting. So their seasonality is similar to our MH and RV portfolio, but it's even more heavily weighted to Q3 and Q2. So, seasonality is generally in Q1 15% to 17% of EBITDA, Q2 30% to 32%, Q3 35% to 37%, and Q4 is 16% to 18%. And so we're busy putting together 2021 information, and we look forward to providing some additional information on that seasonality when we provide our 2021 guidance. I think it's primarily due to the expectations of the Safe Harbor contribution. As I mentioned a little bit earlier, when I look at the rest of the portfolio exempting Safe Harbor, between I think the partial year contribution from our acquisitions along with the expected transient RV and vacation rental and ancillary contributions that will be very strong, along with higher even broker commissions. Those items are basically offsetting any sort of negative COVID impact that we might have to manufactured housing rents, based on delayed or lowered rent increases, annual RV impacts or even our home sales impacts. There's not an anticipation that ancillary will be a negative to the fourth quarter. And just overall, Q4 is lower for the core portfolio just based on our own internal seasonality and the way transient business impacts that. I think from a capital allocation perspective, on the marina side, I think initial expectations are in the $200 million to $300 million range. And just looking forward for the company overall, I think we're going to continue to deploy capital in the MH and RV space, although it's getting tougher. Our long-term relationships are tax-advantageous structures and our trusted name recognition really continues to bear fruit for acquisition opportunities, evidenced by over $300 million in acquisitions so far this year. And we have a very robust pipeline. And outside of the large portfolio transactions, we've been able to typically deploy between $250 million and $300 million in acquisitions per year. And besides that, we'll continue to deploy long-term growth capital on expansions and developments. No, it was $250. It was $250. And it's interesting that ours is between $250 and $300 a site, 300 sites, so pretty close to what we experienced. Inclusive of vacation rental. The cottage and vacation rental."

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good morning. And thank you for joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results and provide an update on the continuing impact of COVID-19. We hope that you and your families are staying healthy and managing through this challenging time. We're now in our 7th month of navigating the pandemic, and we are pleased to share that our performance continues to exceed our expectations. Our commitment to the safety of our residents, guests, and team members remains our top priority, and we are balancing this responsibility with our pledge to deliver Sun's signature service throughout our communities and resorts. In addition to the solid performance delivered in our manufactured housing and RV portfolios, we are excited to further expand and enhance our platform with the pending acquisition of Safe Harbor Marinas. Safe Harbor brings a high-quality rental revenue stream, adds diversity in terms of geography and customer base, and is expected to further enhance Sun's earnings growth potential over the long term. We are pleased with our results for the third quarter as our RV portfolio continued to build reservation momentum on a week-over-week basis and manufactured housing continued to see increased demand given the need for affordable housing. We outperformed initial expectations discussed during our second quarter earnings call in July, primarily due to the strong performance of our transient RV business and related ancillary income generated at our resorts. Our third quarter forecast guided to a net reduction due to the impact from the virus of up to $15 million from our original budget. As the quarter progressed, we continued to perform better than forecast expectations and ultimately outperformed our forecast by approximately $20 million. RVing [ph] proved to be a preferred method of vacationing across the country, due in large part to the ability for travelers to drive to and more safely vacation in our resorts, enjoying the outdoor lifestyle while remaining socially distanced. Our reported core FFO per share was $1.60 for the third quarter, 9.6% ahead of last year. The 5.5% same community NOI growth delivered in the third quarter underscores the resiliency of our platform and the demand for our product. In the quarter, we grew same community occupancy 200 basis points to 98.8%. Additionally, during the third quarter, we deployed approximately $205 million in the acquisition of two manufactured housing communities and five RV resorts, totaling approximately 2,500 developed sites and an additional 109 expansion sites. The majority of these acquisitions came to us through our long-standing industry relationships. Our pipeline of single assets and small portfolios and manufactured housing and RV is as full as ever. So is continuing to see the benefits of the transaction with Sun, given certainty of execution, tax deferment strategies and the knowledge that Sun will improve and continue managing these assets to the best possible standards. We also completed the construction of approximately 685 sites across our expansions, ground up, and redevelopment projects, bringing total development sites delivered for the year to almost 1,200 and 11 communities and resorts in nine states. On September 29th, we announced the pending acquisition of Safe Harbor Marinas for $2.1 billion. This acquisition will serve to expand our loyal customer base, diversify our geographic footprint, and add incremental revenue streams, which we believe will strengthen our ability to generate industry-leading growth over the long term. We are very excited about Safe Harbor Marinas and look forward to welcoming the entire Safe Harbor team to the Sun family. We anticipate that this acquisition will close at the end of this month. We have not lost sight of the potential impact of the virus and the hardship that it has accompanied the pandemic across the country. Overall, we believe that Sun has been a net beneficiary as a consequence of customer behavior, the demand for our homes, and the safety of our vacation properties. As we have said in the prior two quarters, we did not know the duration or the ultimate impact on the economy or our operations. Thus far, we have proven our ability to navigate the environment and successfully execute our business strategy. Throughout the pandemic, our team has worked tirelessly to serve our residents and guests and produce the results we're discussing with you today. The team has demonstrated an ability to adapt while maintaining Sun's high customer service standards that are central to the business. I would like to thank each one of our team members for going above and beyond in contributing to our outstanding results. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results in more detail. John? It's Gary, John. And it's a good question and a question that we really spend time on and diligence on during our underwriting of both Safe Harbor and the other marina opportunities that we've looked at over the last four years or so. And I think that one of the things that attracted us to Safe Harbor was their outlook on what they are inclined to want to bring into their platform and what they are inclined not to want to or exclude from their acquisition horizons. And we got comfortable with the fact that the current portfolio and the acquisition objectives take into account as best they can, both historical indications of what have happened, mostly title wise, as well as droughts. And they've focused on the big water opportunities and the coastal opportunities. Certainly, there is future climate risk throughout the marina business and all assets, however you look at those risks with regard to hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, floods, title issues. But the existing portfolio we feel has really been scrutinized and hand selected well. So to the best of our underwriting ability, we think it's the best the best marinas to own, insulated as much as possible from the environmental issues. There are none that I'm aware of. That being said, there have been adjustments made to docks and things like that, fixed docks are now floating docks. And that capital has been invested in areas where they've seen a benefit to putting the floating docks in. And as an industry common, I think that's the way of the future, if you will, where the fixed moorings become less and less frequent than the floating moorings, which interestingly enough, much of it is done with floating concrete. A lot of air is injected into that concrete. And I think that's the forward direction of most marinas. Well, we thank you again for joining us today, and we believe Sun has demonstrated its durability and resiliency during these challenging times. We look forward to sharing additional information with you and guidance on our fourth quarter call. Thank you. Be safe."

            "name": "John McLaren",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Our results in the third quarter speak to the resilience of our platform as we outperformed our forecasted expectations across all of our revenue streams. From a total portfolio perspective, we gained 776 revenue-producing sites, a 1.3% increase boosting total occupancy to 97.2%, up 50 basis points from last year. This now brings our year-to-date revenue-producing site gains to approximately 1,930 sites putting us within striking distance of achieving our original RPS gain budget for 2020. The demand for our communities and resorts is stronger than ever. Manufactured housing revenue producing site gains totaled 1,400 sites, or 72% of total site gains year-to-date. 910 of these gains were in manufactured housing expansion communities. The balance of the RPS gains, or 530 sites, came from conversions of transient RV sites to annual leases. Our same community portfolio NOI for the third quarter rose 5.5%, resulting from a 5.4% increase in revenues and a 5.2% increase in operating expenses, which included $1.1 million of PPE-related expenses. Adjusting for our PPE expense, same community NOI growth would have been 6.2%. Our weighted average rental rate increase was 3.6% for the portfolio with manufactured housing at 3.2% and annual RV at 5.5%. Same community manufactured housing revenues increased by 5.4%, driven by the discussed 3.2% rental rate increase and occupancy gains over the last 12 months. Same community annual RV revenues increased by 3.6% and transient RV revenues rose by 5%. On the expense side, while we no longer have team members on furlough, we did have payroll savings due to the delayed hiring for seasonal positions. Our rental program continues to perform well. In the quarter we had a 9% increase in applications to rent the home from Sun and our rental home renewal rate was 67%. Consistent with renewal trends experienced during the second quarter. These renewal rates are 10% better than historical averages. For the quarter total applications to live in a Sun committee, inclusive of sales rose 12% year-over-year. Moving to rent collection, manufactured housing and annual RV collections continue to be strong with MH at approximately 97% and RV at approximately 98%. Month-to-date collections for October are consistent with historical results. These strong collection figures underscore the fundamental strength and stability of our balanced portfolio of manufactured housing and RV communities. With regard to home sales, in the third quarter, we sold 710 homes compared to 906 homes last year. We had less pre-owned inventory to sell as a result of higher renewal rates and longer resident tenure. New home sales revenue grew 20% and our gross margin expanded 3.5% in the quarter to 18.7%. This was driven by a 29% increase in our average new home price of $153,000. New home sales, many of which are in our ground-up developments and expansions, are concentrated in Colorado, Florida, and South Carolina, and have higher-than-average new home prices and gross sales margins. Interesting to note, our brokered home sales are up 37% in the quarter, indicating continued strong demand in our communities, which has also contributed to less inventory for sale. Our RV business, particularly our transient RV business, experienced heightened demand supporting our thesis about travel preferences during the pandemic. We experienced a consistent build in weekly demand with record visits to our websites and calls to our reservation centers. Anecdotally, our Instagram following has grown fourfold over the last four months. As previously discussed, we saw an acceleration in the recovery of our transient RV business throughout the summer once stay-at-home restrictions were lifted in our communities. To demonstrate the velocity of the recovery, recall that the third quarter started with the Fourth of July weekend where our same community transient RV revenues were down approximately 5% on a year-over-year basis, as travel had just started to pick up. Fast forward to Labor Day, our revenues were up 5.4% on a year-over-year basis. Transient RV revenues for the month of September ended up being 32% better than our original budget. This strength is carrying into the fourth quarter, and we are anticipating a high single-digit revenue increase over last year. We remain optimistic in our demand outlook given the increasing popularity of RV vacationing. Our experience thus far with the impact that pandemic has reinforced our confidence in the durability of our cash flows and the strength of our portfolio and our strategy. I would now like to turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial results and balance sheet. Karen? Hey, Nick, it's John. Good morning. Well, I think the first obvious thing is they all want to come down and get out of the cold. Okay, there's no question. And I think that a lot of people are focused on whether or not the border will open, but I think it's important to break it out into two parts. First really is the transient business and looking back on our seasonality on that. Canadian guests only represent about 5% of our yearly transient budget, and so when you look at like Q4, that represents less than 1% of that. But with snowboard season coming, as you might expect, we've been working on executing on plans and campaigns for months to help secure any potential softness that may come in demand, inclusive of having elevated campaign segmentation targeted more to U.S. guests. At this point in time, I can tell you I'm very comfortable with the proactiveness the team has had and the strategy we've employed over the last four months to offset any potential Canadian business decline domestically. With respect to annuals, which is the other component of that, I think, really, their homes are in our communities, and like I said, they want to come down to their winter homes. We've spoken with many of them. They still plan to come down, and in fact, some even might come sooner to enjoy the winter warmth. And I think it's important to note also that our annual guests are all under lease contracts for their homes located in our communities, and we have developed and implemented a number of strategies to help support those folks that may not be able to come down at least as early as they want. We could see some shifts where maybe some of those annuals might come down. Maybe they can't come down in December or maybe they can't come down in January, but maybe they come down in February, March, April, and stay a little longer as well. So all in all, I feel very confident with what we're doing from a marketing and strategic perspective to recapture any potential offset we might have. Yeah. I think Karen covered in her earlier remarks, there are a lot of pieces going into fourth quarter and beyond post Safe Harbor. So we do look forward to closing the transaction at the end of the month and being able to share guidance. But sharing the seasonality I hope will be very helpful as you build your models. But the sensitivity of fourth quarter is absolutely lowest in the RV transient as well. So it represents about 15%. So it's not going to be as strong as it was in third quarter. Yeah, I mean, October is solidly up year over year. And like we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do expect the highest single-digit growth for Q4. That's about the best outlook I can give you for the fourth quarter at this point in time, John. You know, but I would say that looking out beyond that, again, that's something that we really need to include when we release guidance here in the fourth quarter. Yeah. Annual represents about -- Canadians represent about 7.6% of annual revenue and transient is 5.1% from Canada. Yeah. Yeah, it's very, very similar. I think that when we sat down and did our underwriting, and as Baxter shared on some of our early calls when we announced the deal. Interestingly enough, when you divide their entire CapEx on a per slip [ph] basis, it was approximately $250 per site. Karen's correcting me. So very similar to our industry. And I think it just, again, underpins how much similarity there are. Certainly there are differences between the marinas, the customers, the business. But the core fundamentals, as we've talked about, supply, demand, all the things that MH and RV are known for are similar. And then working through the CapEx, it was a pleasant surprise for us to see it very similar to our existing core business. Yeah. I think we might have shared this before. But we had temporarily halted our rent increases in the spring, I think you know. And in response to the unprecedented impact of COVID, when we reinstated those increases, we elected to do it at a lower rate to both aid and supporting our loyal residents and to better secure occupancy and long-term success of the business for all Sun stakeholders. So I think right now we're right about we're averaging 3.2%, and we would expect that to finish out 2020 at about 3%, John. No. There's nothing that really stands out, John? No, because of the demand that we've got throughout the country, we've applied it on a pretty consistent basis throughout the portfolio. Yeah. Samir, this is John. Hey, hey, I think it's primarily as a result of the reservation activity that we've had. We've just simply had more people come into our resorts which drives that ancillary business at the same time. Yeah, inclusive of... Yeah. Yeah. Thank you."

At this time, management would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can provide no assurance that its expectations will be achieved. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations include the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other details -- others detailed in yesterday's press release and from time to time in the company's periodic filings within the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the release.  Having said this, I'd like to introduce management with us today: Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John McLaren, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Karen Dearing, Chief Financial Officer. After their remarks, there'll be an opportunity to ask a question. I'll now turn the call over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, please go ahead.\nGary Shiffman: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results and provide an update on how Sun is navigating the impact of COVID-19. We hope that everyone is staying healthy and managing through this challenging time. The intensity of the pandemic across the country continues to evolve, and the environment has been challenging, but I'm happy to report that all of our manufactured housing and RV properties are open for business and performing. We have worked hard to keep our residents, guests and team members safe. From a customer service perspective, we remain focused on delivering the signature service that Sun's residents and guests have come to expect across the portfolio.  We are pleased with our results for the second quarter in light of the challenges presented by the virus. The team's skilled execution of our operating and financial plans has served to mitigate the impact on our business. For the second quarter, we realized a net FFO impact of approximately $10.8 million below our original budget which is better than our initial expectation of $15 million to $18 million provided during our first quarter release. Factors driving our performance included strong manufactured housing revenues, rental program results and expense savings and personnel costs and variable operating expenses primarily due to RV resorts that were not open. Offsets to positive contributors in the quarter were largely due to the COVID-related restrictions on our transient RV business. Despite obstacles related to the virus, our reported core FFO per share was $1.12 for the second quarter.  In addition, Sun Communities generated positive same community NOI growth of 1.4%. Adjusting for $900,000 of direct COVID-19 related expenses, NOI growth would have been 2%. As of June 30, 2020, all of our manufactured housing communities and RV resorts are open with varying degrees of occupancy limitations in certain of our amenities to comply with public health guidelines set by state and local governments. Over 80% of our furloughed team members have returned to work and base compensation for main office team members, executive officers and the Board has been restored to prior levels. From an operational perspective, we are seeing the resilience of Sun's unique platform in action. Total portfolio occupancy in the second quarter rose 70 basis points year-over-year as we added 851 revenue-producing sites, a 27% increase over last year. We also completed the construction of almost 500 vacant expansion, redevelopment and ground-up development sites.  As the country has reopened, we've experienced steady incremental improvement in our reservation pace for July and August. Moreover, our forward bookings for September and October have surpassed pre pandemic budgeted expectations. While the potential for local and state mandates could impact this trend, we believe this improved reservation pace reflects pent-up demand and our ability to offer a vacation option that is perceived to be both safer and easier to control as compared to other alternatives. RV travel is the preferred mode for families to get away this summer. Expected strong sales growth in June and beyond limited only by the amount of available inventory supports this thesis as discussed by major RV manufacturers like Winnebago and Thor Industries.  Articles on the RV lifestyle are trending in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal among many other national and local media outlets. While we remain optimistic on forward booking trends, we must be cognizant of the current situation related to COVID-19 and how it might affect travel in the months ahead. The underlying strength of our business in the midst of this pandemic gave us the confidence to raise $633 million of equity in May. This raise allows us to act on a very active deal pipeline and resume growth capital expenditure projects, such as site expansions and ground up developments. While we do not know the duration of the pandemic and its ultimate financial impact on Sun's business, we do know that Sun is in a position of strength operationally due to the high-quality of our portfolio and the nature of our offerings as well as financially due to the strength of our balance sheet.  It has been a challenging year thus far, and I commend each and every one of our team members for going above and beyond during these past few months. Their commitment to executing on Sun's core principles has been exemplary. John will now discuss our operating results in more detail.\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. Despite the challenges presented to our business by the pandemic, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. Quick implementation of our emergency preparedness plan, cost containment efforts and better-than-expected manufactured housing revenues mitigated the financial to our second quarter results. From a total portfolio perspective, we gained 851 revenue-producing sites, a 27% increase over the second quarter 2019, boosting total occupancy to 97.3%. Moreover, the financial hardship program implemented for April and May rent is now in the 12-month installment repayment period, and we are happy to report that over 17% of total deferred rent has already been collected and approximately 400 residents have paid their deferred rent in full.  Our same community portfolio demonstrated resilience in the second quarter. NOI grew by 1.4%, resulting from a 1.8% decline in revenues and an 8% decline in expenses due to delayed seasonal opening of a number of RV resorts and portfolio-wide measures taken at the property level to reduce variable expenses. Manufactured housing revenues increased by 6%, driven by a 3.9% weighted average rental rate increase year-over-year and occupancy gains over the last 12 months. Annual RV revenues increased by 3.2% and transient RV revenue declined by 37%, largely due to delayed openings at our resorts during the quarter as discussed previously. On the expense side, we experienced reductions across payroll and health benefits driven by furloughs and delayed seasonal hiring, utilities and certain maintenance items given restricted access to most amenities. Variable expense savings realized in the second quarter are expected to be lower in the second half of the year as furloughed and seasonal team members return to work and amenities that were not accessible in the second quarter due to state and local restrictions are returned to service.  Same community occupancy improved 190 basis points to 98.7%, reflecting almost 2,300 revenue-producing site gains over the last 12 months. Additionally, our rental program exhibited resilience with a 17% increase in applications to rent-a-home from Sun and an elevated rental home renewal rate of 68.2% in the quarter. Total applications were up almost 5% year-over-year. This demonstrates the continued strength of our platform and the demand to live in a Sun community.  With regard to rent collection, net of hardship deferrals and prepaid balances, manufactured housing collections averaged 97% for the second quarter and are at 96% as of July 21. These collection percentages are in line with 2019 figures as of the same dates. Additionally, over the second quarter, collections averaged approximately 98% for annual RV site rent, also in line with the second quarter of 2019. These strong collection figures across the portfolio are indicative of the resilience and predictability of our balanced portfolio of manufactured housing and RV communities.  Moving on to home sales, in the second quarter, we sold 611 homes as compared to 927 homes last year. Shelter in place restrictions and the inability to show homes physically contributed to the year-over-year decline. While pre-owned home sales were down, new home sales revenues grew 15%, and our gross margin expanded by 7% in the quarter, driven by the sale of 140 new homes. Our average new home price increased 14% over last year to $137,000. We believe that our manufactured home price point and high-quality communities are likely to make Sun a preferred provider of affordable detached housing today and in the post-COVID economy. Our RV business, particularly our transient RV business has shown steady improvement week after week as travel restrictions were lifted throughout the quarter. We have seen an acceleration in website visits, call volume and reservations. For example, Memorial Day weekend trends in RV revenues were down 39% as compared to last year, while transient RV revenues for the fourth of July weekend were down just 5.5% compared to last year. In addition, forward bookings for the month of September and October are trending greater than 10% growth over the same period last year.  Gary referred to the strong projected RV sales figures and trending media coverage surrounding the growth and demand for the RV lifestyle over the past few months. We are bullish on RV vacationing and have seen the follow-through from our guests and our forward bookings. We believe that most other travel options, including air travel and cruises, could take longer to return to pre-COVID levels. Given the breadth and high-quality of the resorts we own, we are well-positioned to benefit from the increasing popularity of the RV lifestyle and vacation option. We offer an excellent product and our resort performance during this challenging time reinforces the importance of this business to our overall platform.  We are resolute in our view of the long-term viability of our mission and our business model. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of affordable housing and the desirability of competitively priced and safer vacation options for consumers. Sun, in many ways, has set the standard, and we remain at the forefront of providing a quality experience to fulfill this need. I would now like to turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial results and balance sheet preparedness.\nKaren Dearing: Thank you, John. I'd like to begin by reviewing our financial results, followed by a discussion of our balance sheet as well as our expectations for the third quarter. For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we reported $1.12 per share in core funds from operations as compared to $1.18 last year. The year-over-year change reflects the previously mentioned $10.8 million FFO impact from COVID-19, which was better than our original expectations. During and subsequent to quarter end, we acquired a manufactured home community in California with 372 developed sites and 2 RV resorts located in Oregon and Florida totaling 544 sites. Our year-to-date acquisition volume is $132 million. Additionally, we sold our only Montana community for $13 million. In May, we closed an underwritten public offering of nearly 5 million shares, netting $633 million in proceeds. We intend to use the proceeds to continue to fund our growth initiatives, including acquisitions, ground-up developments and expansion projects. At quarter end, we had $3.4 billion in debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 3.86% and a weighted average maturity of 11.6 years.  Our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio at June 30 was 4.8x. The pandemic and its financial and operational implications continue to be a fluid situation. While we have seen an improvement in our level of transient RV reservations, we also recognize the recent spike in new COVID-19 cases may introduce unforeseen challenges in the third quarter and beyond, which is why we will not be reinstating guidance. In addition, a number of the variable expense savings realized in the second quarter will not continue for the remainder of the year as all of our communities are now open. Based on our original budget, the third quarter was expected to be our biggest contributor, representing approximately 31% of budgeted FFO for the year. With the information we have available today, our forecasted reduction to original budget for the third quarter is between $12 million and $15 million. This range includes expected reductions to the original budget of $9.5 million of income from real property across manufactured housing, annual RV and transient RV, $2.5 million of net contribution from ancillary services and $2 million of net contribution from home sales.  It also includes $650,000 of additional expenses related to the acquisition of personal protective equipment and products for heightened cleaning protocols. The decisive actions we have taken year-to-date provide Sun with meaningful financial flexibility to react to operational challenges during this time. We also believe that we are well-positioned to respond opportunistically to acquisitions as they arise. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our prepared remarks. We would like to open the call now for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Nick Joseph from Citigroup.\nNicholas Joseph: Karen, I appreciate the color into third quarter. So the $9.5 million impact to the real property, can you please break that down between the MH annual RV and transient RV expectations?\nKaren Dearing: Yes, sure, Nick. As you noted, we included a range of $12 million to $15 million. $9.5 million of it on income from property, the MH piece is due to rent increase changes, annual RV shortened seasons, and there's a small impact on transient RV. That's about $1.8 million. So the difference between the 9.5 -- 8.5 -- $1.8 million, I'm sorry, you can probably split between the two categories, MH and annual RV.\nNicholas Joseph: That's helpful. And then for the acquisition pipeline, you mentioned the equity that you raised in the second quarter and the expectation to redeploy that. So can you talk about where the pipeline is today. And then maybe just on pricing, where initial yields are now? And if you've seen any change from pre-COVID?\nGary Shiffman: Thanks, Nick, it's Gary. I would share with everyone that the pipeline is very full with a lot of attractive opportunities for Sun. Inbound calls from owner-operators looking to discuss potential transactions have never been higher. We have all the relationships built over the 30-plus years, estate planning going on, a lot of it directly driven by the pandemic and factors related to it, where the timing is just right to open up those discussions. So we expect to continue a strong pace of acquisitions, and that was the result and the driving reason for the equity offering. Going into the year, we had discussed a target of about $150 million and to date, we've closed on about $132 million and second quarter, and subsequent to second quarter, acquisitions closed were about $110 million. So we're beginning to drive up that closing rate. And we expect to continue to deploy our growth capital throughout the balance of the year. We think that having access to the equity marketplace will allow us to take advantage of external growth opportunities and provide some outsized long-term growth for our shareholders.  When we look at cap rates, I would share with everyone on the call today, this is where I've been somewhat surprised. Having been focused on our industry, both manufactured and RV resorts., I had expected that there might be a little bit of relief on cap rates and I would share that the opposite has actually been our experience to date. There's lots of available capital out there, lower interest rates today and the continued recognition of the fundamentals of both manufactured housing and the RV platforms. They've continued to push on cap rates more than I would have expected in both segments. And we've seen a lot of lower quality, less well-located communities, if you will, trading in the low 4s and sometimes a touch below.  And I would give some measure, just in the interest of trying to be as helpful and transparent as we can at Sun, we have looked at more than $500 million of transactions very, very carefully, most of which would be contenders and have not been willing to come down to the pricing where these transactions have been going. That being said, we have an acquisition pipeline that allows me to say that we will be able to put the equity to work to give you some sense of where we're thinking the 3 properties that Karen spoke about that we have closed on the acquisitions. We're in a range of a 4.7 cap rate, up to a 6.2% cap rate range. And we will continue to be looking in that range as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets.\nWesley Golladay: Can you talk about what you're seeing for annual RV conversion from a demand perspective?\nJohn McLaren: Sure. This is John. So I mean I will tell you that 2020 has been, as you can see with the results, a bit challenging on the RV conversion standpoint, and a lot of that's because the healthy respect that we've had for social distancing, and we've had to temporarily -- we had to temporarily maybe not interact so much with our guests face-to-face, which is very much how we secure RV conversions. Many of our southern conversions happen -- generally happen at the end of March, mid-April and northern conversions, most of those happen in early in June and early July. So the timing wasn't great as well. But that said, the reason why we've been so successful converting transient to annual is because guests love coming to our resorts. So I think once things settle down and we get closer to normal again, that conversion activity will resume. Yes.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then let's see, looking at the -- your sites, I think you mentioned they were all open. And just curious, is that -- are all the RV transient sites open to all guests. I know there were some restrictions earlier, if you had to say a certain length of period of the year it was open. But I just want to clarify that all the RV sites are open for everybody now.\nJohn McLaren: Every resort is open. We do have some sites in Ontario that are still not available for transient guests. And we've just got a few communities out in California where they're -- there are some limitations as the number of transient or short-term guests that you can have at any given time. So we still got a little bit of that going on right now.\nWesley Golladay: Got you. And last one, do you expect to start any developments later this year?\nJohn McLaren: Well, we actually -- in the quarter, we actually added additional sites to some of the developments that we had done from ground up that we'd opened up last year. I am excited to say that Larkspur, which is in Colorado, opened up their sites in the second quarter, which is a big thing for us because it's very well-located just south of Denver. And we will look to add additional site deliveries for those ground ups in phases over the course of this year. And we are solidly in the ground. In fact, I just saw it myself a week ago at Costa Vista in San Diego, should be coming out of the ground early next year as far as opening is concerned.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Good morning, everyone. Gary, just kind of thinking big picture, the new expanded unemployment benefits or like what expires soon unless Congress enacts additional legislation. How are you thinking about MH all-age occupancy kind of going forward if those run out, it seems like long-term, probably benefit from just the affordable nature of it, but just kind of near term.\nGary Shiffman: This is Gary. And then John, you can feel free to add anything in here, but I mean I can only give you the perspective of what we have talked about for a long period of time. And after being in the business for 30-plus years, I think manufactured housing is as resilient of an asset class as I've experienced in real estate. It's affordable housing. We typically share with everyone. We're not recession proof, but when we look particularly in the balance of our portfolio, it's designed intentionally with age-restricted communities and all age communities because over the long period of time, we find that our growth is best with that balance. And so when you just look at the age-restricted communities, we do get more turnover when there are very challenging periods of economic.\nKaren Dearing: All age.\nGary Shiffman: All age. I'm sorry, all-age economic downturns, but it's more than made up by the increased desire for affordable housing. So when we look through all the various economic downturns, the great financial crisis, others, some of our strongest growth is post those economic downturns. So again, not recession proof, but very, very resilient and a great opportunity, I think, like other -- unlike other asset classes to bounce back pretty strong. And then when we talk about things that we look at, like bad debt, we look back 18 years, which we did recently. And the range has averaged -- bad debt has averaged around 100 basis points, 110 basis points from a low of about 60 basis points to a high of 140 basis points annually during that 18-year period of time. And if I go back in my notes, that's pretty similar to how it goes. So John, you might want to add some color to what you're seeing.\nJohn McLaren: Yes. The only color I'd add, Gary, is just that sort of on the overwhelming side, meaning the number of people that are coming to our communities, Josh, I mean, we're already seeing it as far as the application counts that we've gotten for the second quarter having a total apps up 5% in the midst of this quarter-over-quarter as well as rental home applications being up 17%. Our off the street sales applications are up 22%. And so like Gary said, recession resistance is a good way to characterize it because in the end, there are going to be people that maybe are in different forms of housing, okay, that come into our product than what we've seen over time. Yes, we lose a few people marginally from an occupancy standpoint, but we overwhelmingly offset it with the number of people that are coming into our product. That's been the experience over that period of time, the 18 years, Gary is talking about. And so it's -- we feel pretty optimistic about what the future holds from that respect.\nGary Shiffman: And why did we choose 18 years? Because John McLaren, our Chief Operating Officer, started here 18 years ago.\nKaren Dearing: From the moment he walked in the door.\nJohn McLaren: I cut my teeth in collections in this business.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Awesome. And then maybe just one more for me. You mentioned -- I think you said 80% of the furlough teammates have come back. Any sense of how payroll and benefits in your same community will kind of trend through 3Q? Like today, where they all -- was that 80% fully back at the start of the quarter? Or that just happened recently?\nKaren Dearing: No, they were pretty much back by the start of the first quarter, Josh. So we're not really expecting any real reductions in payroll from that perspective for the third quarter.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Would 1Q be a decent run rate to use for 3Q for that line item then?\nKaren Dearing: Well, it's tough to say because of seasonality. You've got RV, which has a higher level of team members in it. So I'd have to take a look back. You probably follow-up with Fernando on that, Josh, but I can't make that comparison right now.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.\nPiljung Kim: I realize transient RV has picked up since the second quarter. But I was wondering if you could share what the occupancy rate was for the transient RV segment in the second quarter and today versus the same periods last year.\nGary Shiffman: Actually, John, unfortunately, I don't have that figure right in front of me. It's something that we can follow back up with you on after the call. I apologize for that.\nJohn McLaren: Okay. But in your prepared remarks, it sounded like transient RV was trending ahead of last year, excluding the July 4 weekend. Is that correct?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. I mean it's been -- I would characterize it as over the course of the quarter, if I look at the revenue and what we've done between April, May and June, it has consistently been picking up, and that's been a result of the lifting of the stay at home orders and the -- and those limitations that we've had. And I think it speaks to what Gary said a lot -- many times, which is the pent-up demand that's out there for people to get out. And we clearly see that looking at sequentially each of the months. And so without having the actual figure, I know the occupancy has ticked up, and I see that in the revenue, but we can, again, circle back on those figures for you.\nJohn McLaren: This might be helpful because, John, your question is a question we're studying all the time as we look at our business platform and how we're approaching it. But one thing we've discovered when we talk about resilience that through downturns in the economy, gas prices that have been approaching $5 a gallon, if those of you who can remember that far back, I can. Swings in RV annual sales. Those measures, as we look back historically, revenues have grown in our RV communities on an average of 90 to 100 basis points greater than our manufactured housing business over a 10, 15, 20 year period of time.  So I think that while we're not brushing aside the impact of the pandemic, fundamentally, as John used the word bullish, we're really proponents of how resilient the RV business is going to be both annual and transient as the strong demand comes back. And we're seeing that both here in our portfolio and in our investment over in Australia, where it's pretty much forward reservations in Australia, which I reviewed the other day, are up 24% for the forward 12-month period of time, and they struggled also through closures of their internal borders, travel restrictions and stay-at-home mandates. So I think that we feel very, very good about how our RV transient and annual business will perform subject to the uncertainty of governmental actions and things like that as the pandemic goes forward. And we're also cognizant of the changing environment daily of what's going on with the virus.\nPiljung Kim: But in your $9.5 million reduction versus budget to real property, some of that was transient RV, as Karen mentioned, is that purely from the July 4 weekend? Or are you baking in some conservatism in the back half of the quarter?\nKaren Dearing: Yes. There's a little bit of conservatism there. Obviously, we don't know what's going on. That's a reduction to transient RV represents 97.8% of what our budget is. So it's pretty small amount of conservatism there.\nPiljung Kim: Okay. On the expansion front, you've delivered 851 revenue-producing sites this quarter. Some of that was probably delayed in the first quarter. But how close is this to a run rate quarterly figure for the rest of the year?\nJohn McLaren: You mean for revenue-producing sites, John?\nPiljung Kim: Yes.\nJohn McLaren: Well, I think that puts us for the year at roughly 1,150 plus or minus -- actually, 1,151 sites that we've gained year-to-date. So I think our original guidance was somewhere -- I think it was about 2,600 is what we had in original guidance. So I guess the way I'd answer that question is some of it's going to be -- we had a really good second quarter on the RPS front and gaining sites. It was higher than last year, as we shared in the remarks. I think that some of it is just dependent upon, as Gary mentioned, everything is subject to what happens going forward in the pandemic, but based on the application counts, it's difficult for me to give you really sort of a guidance number of what it would be at this time. But I think that yes. It's just -- I think it's still a little bit early, John, to provide that right now. But I am pleased with where we're at. It is close to where we were. I think it's about 100 sites shorter than where we were last year at this time. So we're in striking distance of being in the range.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors.\nJohn Pawlowski: I wanted to circle back on the collections conversation from earlier. The 110 bps average bad debt over the last 18 years and a high of, I believe, 140 or 150, what you referenced there. Is that high watermark a reasonable betting line over these coming years from everything you see on the ground today? Because the portfolio is better situated today, just geographically and quality but unemployment is pretty darn high right now. So just everything you see in terms of the strain on your consumer today is that 140 bps, 150 bps kind of bad debt, net bad debt numbers, a reasonable bogey?\nGary Shiffman: Well, you used the word bet. We don't tend to bet a little bit. We like to be as precise as we possibly can. And it's difficult to have clarity, okay, in an environment that's pretty unprecedented. And it's scary, by the way. But I can share with you, though, is post-2008, we didn't see a spike beyond that range. And for a period of time, we've been operating in that range. I think that Karen can share with you some of the metrics because we have thought through a little bit of reserve and accruing for bad debt, but I don't think that it's anything that far out of that range.\nKaren Dearing: Okay. Yes. The -- just as far as Gary saying that, that has really on par. That being said, we -- with the uncertainty we have, including hardship repayments, we did conservatively accrue an additional $2 million of bad debt in Q2. So Q2 bad debt is about 100 bps of revenue without that $2 million, I think, 64 bps.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. With unemployment remained elevated, is there -- I mean is there a chance that you have to reinstate the deferral program? Or are consumers coming to you or renters coming to you still asking for relief, even though you've cut it -- or you've stopped it in June?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. This is John. So we actually -- that -- we cut it off in June, but we have not had a lot of requests for the program and part of the reason why we did end it in June was because those had trailed off significantly. So I -- at this point in time, again, it's hard to say. But at this point in time, we don't have any expectations that we would have to reengage that program.\nGary Shiffman: John, it is very fluid, but we can share with you because we do discuss this. And like all of you, we are wondering what's going to happen with the stimulus package, what's going to happen with unemployment. But there is nothing that we're seeing out of what we've shared with you where we could discuss now some vulnerability, if you will, other than the small piece that Karen shared to be conservative and on the unemployment side, there's nothing on collections. In fact, it was somewhat unusual for us to receive the request that we received for prepayment in full of the rent deferral. John, what was the percentage of that?\nJohn McLaren: 17%.\nGary Shiffman: 17%. Whereby they had 12 months to really pay this back. So interestingly enough, it's almost as if there's some conservatism by some of our residents who want to know currently that they can pay back that deferral that gives us a little bit comfort, if you will, and how we're going to navigate these uncertain times.\nJohn McLaren: I think it's also important, just again, to kind of go on back in history to look at what we shared in terms of the resilience of the business. I mean they were fairly tough times in the early 2000s that we went through, still grew. There were tough times through the global financial crisis. We still grew, okay? And so it's again, it goes back to the fact of what is it we have, we have affordable vacation, we have affordable housing, we have a product that is needed in all economic cycles, okay? And so it's just a matter of -- it doesn't -- to us, it's resistant because it doesn't really matter what the economic cycle is, the need is always there. And we're seeing that come through with our application counts and all the other things that we've shared along the way, too, John.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. I appreciate all the thoughts. Maybe just 1 last one for me. Circling back to Nick's first question on the roughly $10 million impact on real property income for the coming quarter. And I think Karen, you mentioned it's roughly half split between MH and annual RV and the other transient. So the not increasing rents on the annual RVs or MH, is there a -- have you come up with a date on when you're going to start increasing rents again? Or is it a month-by-month process?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. This is John. So we've already implemented the rent increase process again, John. One of the things that we've always said is that the most important -- the best revenue-producing site you can gain is the one you never lose. And so we've been very thoughtful, very careful in terms of the rent increase for 2020 with the goal of doing what's right for all of Sun's stakeholders. So -- but we have engaged that process.\nKaren Dearing: And just as a reminder, about 50% of our 2020 rent increases were in place prior to mid-March. So after that sort of 3.5-month halt in raising rents we are implementing them now. We think the adjustment to our 2020 -- with that adjustment to our 2020 rent increases, our weighted average MH rent increase is expected to be around 3% rather than 4% that we'd originally guided to by the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Samir Khanal from Evercore ISI.\nSamir Khanal: Gary, sorry if I missed this earlier, but what was the timing of that deployment of that $500 million of equity raise? Is that more of the bulk of those acquisitions? Is that more of a this year's story? Or is it -- are you looking at more in the '21 and further here?\nGary Shiffman: Well, generally, we don't forecast acquisition volume other than to refer to what we've done in the previous years. We're well ahead of pace where we expected to be based on last year's acquisitions with the exemption of the Jensen portfolio. And I would simply state with $132 million closed on so far this year, we should be able to significantly exceed that with what we closed this year. And if anything overlaps into next year, we'll be glad to share this. But for right now, I can only say that our pipeline is extremely full. We are very pleased that we will be able to match up the equity growth capital that we raised to the potential acquisitions, and the timing is really hard to forecast.\nSamir Khanal: I guess my second question is just, can you provide an update on your Australian JV, maybe address how that business has been holding up through -- to sort of COVID-19 here?\nGary Shiffman: Sure. I referenced it a little bit with how similar their RV business has been. But despite tight restrictions over in Australia and certainly within their internal borders, Ingenia really has continued to perform really well during these challenging times. Last quarter, they announced that total year-to-date home sales were $240 million with another 30 expected to close prior to their year-end, which was June 30. So if they close those around 270 home sales should have closed. On the Sun Ingenia development joint venture, we've been slower to deploy our capital over there than our original goal but we continue to wait for some delayed entitlement approvals that are delayed in some part due to the COVID situation there as well.  Our first project, Freshwater in a place called Burpengary. We've closed 7 new homes, generating gross proceeds of about AUD 2.5 million with an additional 15 homes under contract in deposit now which are being constructed. Some delay again through COVID but on track to deliver the kind of results and returns that we hope for in that development. And then I mentioned RV, a few comments before. Similar to what we've experienced in the U.S., but looking forward, now that everything is open, the travel restrictions have been lifted with the exception of one area. 12-month bookings are strong, and they're indicating a revenue increase year-over-year of just over 24%. So they're continuing to perform well. They're getting ready to report on their year-end results, and I'm looking forward to seeing them as much of the market is.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Gary for any further or closing comments.\nGary Shiffman: Well, we want to thank all of you for taking the time out to join us today. We believe Sun's actions in response to this unprecedented period of time ensure that our business is strong through and on the other side of this pandemic. So we look forward to speaking to you at the end of next quarter. And as I always conclude, Fernando, John, myself and Karen are always available for any follow-up questions. Thank you, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Karen Dearing",
            "content": "Thank you, John. I'd like to begin by reviewing our financial results, followed by a discussion of our balance sheet as well as our expectations for the third quarter. For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we reported $1.12 per share in core funds from operations as compared to $1.18 last year. The year-over-year change reflects the previously mentioned $10.8 million FFO impact from COVID-19, which was better than our original expectations. During and subsequent to quarter end, we acquired a manufactured home community in California with 372 developed sites and 2 RV resorts located in Oregon and Florida totaling 544 sites. Our year-to-date acquisition volume is $132 million. Additionally, we sold our only Montana community for $13 million. In May, we closed an underwritten public offering of nearly 5 million shares, netting $633 million in proceeds. We intend to use the proceeds to continue to fund our growth initiatives, including acquisitions, ground-up developments and expansion projects. At quarter end, we had $3.4 billion in debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 3.86% and a weighted average maturity of 11.6 years.  Our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio at June 30 was 4.8x. The pandemic and its financial and operational implications continue to be a fluid situation. While we have seen an improvement in our level of transient RV reservations, we also recognize the recent spike in new COVID-19 cases may introduce unforeseen challenges in the third quarter and beyond, which is why we will not be reinstating guidance. In addition, a number of the variable expense savings realized in the second quarter will not continue for the remainder of the year as all of our communities are now open. Based on our original budget, the third quarter was expected to be our biggest contributor, representing approximately 31% of budgeted FFO for the year. With the information we have available today, our forecasted reduction to original budget for the third quarter is between $12 million and $15 million. This range includes expected reductions to the original budget of $9.5 million of income from real property across manufactured housing, annual RV and transient RV, $2.5 million of net contribution from ancillary services and $2 million of net contribution from home sales.  It also includes $650,000 of additional expenses related to the acquisition of personal protective equipment and products for heightened cleaning protocols. The decisive actions we have taken year-to-date provide Sun with meaningful financial flexibility to react to operational challenges during this time. We also believe that we are well-positioned to respond opportunistically to acquisitions as they arise. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our prepared remarks. We would like to open the call now for questions. Operator? Yes, sure, Nick. As you noted, we included a range of $12 million to $15 million. $9.5 million of it on income from property, the MH piece is due to rent increase changes, annual RV shortened seasons, and there's a small impact on transient RV. That's about $1.8 million. So the difference between the 9.5 -- 8.5 -- $1.8 million, I'm sorry, you can probably split between the two categories, MH and annual RV. All age. From the moment he walked in the door. No, they were pretty much back by the start of the first quarter, Josh. So we're not really expecting any real reductions in payroll from that perspective for the third quarter. Well, it's tough to say because of seasonality. You've got RV, which has a higher level of team members in it. So I'd have to take a look back. You probably follow-up with Fernando on that, Josh, but I can't make that comparison right now. Yes. There's a little bit of conservatism there. Obviously, we don't know what's going on. That's a reduction to transient RV represents 97.8% of what our budget is. So it's pretty small amount of conservatism there. Okay. Yes. The -- just as far as Gary saying that, that has really on par. That being said, we -- with the uncertainty we have, including hardship repayments, we did conservatively accrue an additional $2 million of bad debt in Q2. So Q2 bad debt is about 100 bps of revenue without that $2 million, I think, 64 bps. And just as a reminder, about 50% of our 2020 rent increases were in place prior to mid-March. So after that sort of 3.5-month halt in raising rents we are implementing them now. We think the adjustment to our 2020 -- with that adjustment to our 2020 rent increases, our weighted average MH rent increase is expected to be around 3% rather than 4% that we'd originally guided to by the end of the year."

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results and provide an update on how Sun is navigating the impact of COVID-19. We hope that everyone is staying healthy and managing through this challenging time. The intensity of the pandemic across the country continues to evolve, and the environment has been challenging, but I'm happy to report that all of our manufactured housing and RV properties are open for business and performing. We have worked hard to keep our residents, guests and team members safe. From a customer service perspective, we remain focused on delivering the signature service that Sun's residents and guests have come to expect across the portfolio.  We are pleased with our results for the second quarter in light of the challenges presented by the virus. The team's skilled execution of our operating and financial plans has served to mitigate the impact on our business. For the second quarter, we realized a net FFO impact of approximately $10.8 million below our original budget which is better than our initial expectation of $15 million to $18 million provided during our first quarter release. Factors driving our performance included strong manufactured housing revenues, rental program results and expense savings and personnel costs and variable operating expenses primarily due to RV resorts that were not open. Offsets to positive contributors in the quarter were largely due to the COVID-related restrictions on our transient RV business. Despite obstacles related to the virus, our reported core FFO per share was $1.12 for the second quarter.  In addition, Sun Communities generated positive same community NOI growth of 1.4%. Adjusting for $900,000 of direct COVID-19 related expenses, NOI growth would have been 2%. As of June 30, 2020, all of our manufactured housing communities and RV resorts are open with varying degrees of occupancy limitations in certain of our amenities to comply with public health guidelines set by state and local governments. Over 80% of our furloughed team members have returned to work and base compensation for main office team members, executive officers and the Board has been restored to prior levels. From an operational perspective, we are seeing the resilience of Sun's unique platform in action. Total portfolio occupancy in the second quarter rose 70 basis points year-over-year as we added 851 revenue-producing sites, a 27% increase over last year. We also completed the construction of almost 500 vacant expansion, redevelopment and ground-up development sites.  As the country has reopened, we've experienced steady incremental improvement in our reservation pace for July and August. Moreover, our forward bookings for September and October have surpassed pre pandemic budgeted expectations. While the potential for local and state mandates could impact this trend, we believe this improved reservation pace reflects pent-up demand and our ability to offer a vacation option that is perceived to be both safer and easier to control as compared to other alternatives. RV travel is the preferred mode for families to get away this summer. Expected strong sales growth in June and beyond limited only by the amount of available inventory supports this thesis as discussed by major RV manufacturers like Winnebago and Thor Industries.  Articles on the RV lifestyle are trending in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal among many other national and local media outlets. While we remain optimistic on forward booking trends, we must be cognizant of the current situation related to COVID-19 and how it might affect travel in the months ahead. The underlying strength of our business in the midst of this pandemic gave us the confidence to raise $633 million of equity in May. This raise allows us to act on a very active deal pipeline and resume growth capital expenditure projects, such as site expansions and ground up developments. While we do not know the duration of the pandemic and its ultimate financial impact on Sun's business, we do know that Sun is in a position of strength operationally due to the high-quality of our portfolio and the nature of our offerings as well as financially due to the strength of our balance sheet.  It has been a challenging year thus far, and I commend each and every one of our team members for going above and beyond during these past few months. Their commitment to executing on Sun's core principles has been exemplary. John will now discuss our operating results in more detail. Thanks, Nick, it's Gary. I would share with everyone that the pipeline is very full with a lot of attractive opportunities for Sun. Inbound calls from owner-operators looking to discuss potential transactions have never been higher. We have all the relationships built over the 30-plus years, estate planning going on, a lot of it directly driven by the pandemic and factors related to it, where the timing is just right to open up those discussions. So we expect to continue a strong pace of acquisitions, and that was the result and the driving reason for the equity offering. Going into the year, we had discussed a target of about $150 million and to date, we've closed on about $132 million and second quarter, and subsequent to second quarter, acquisitions closed were about $110 million. So we're beginning to drive up that closing rate. And we expect to continue to deploy our growth capital throughout the balance of the year. We think that having access to the equity marketplace will allow us to take advantage of external growth opportunities and provide some outsized long-term growth for our shareholders.  When we look at cap rates, I would share with everyone on the call today, this is where I've been somewhat surprised. Having been focused on our industry, both manufactured and RV resorts., I had expected that there might be a little bit of relief on cap rates and I would share that the opposite has actually been our experience to date. There's lots of available capital out there, lower interest rates today and the continued recognition of the fundamentals of both manufactured housing and the RV platforms. They've continued to push on cap rates more than I would have expected in both segments. And we've seen a lot of lower quality, less well-located communities, if you will, trading in the low 4s and sometimes a touch below.  And I would give some measure, just in the interest of trying to be as helpful and transparent as we can at Sun, we have looked at more than $500 million of transactions very, very carefully, most of which would be contenders and have not been willing to come down to the pricing where these transactions have been going. That being said, we have an acquisition pipeline that allows me to say that we will be able to put the equity to work to give you some sense of where we're thinking the 3 properties that Karen spoke about that we have closed on the acquisitions. We're in a range of a 4.7 cap rate, up to a 6.2% cap rate range. And we will continue to be looking in that range as we move forward. This is Gary. And then John, you can feel free to add anything in here, but I mean I can only give you the perspective of what we have talked about for a long period of time. And after being in the business for 30-plus years, I think manufactured housing is as resilient of an asset class as I've experienced in real estate. It's affordable housing. We typically share with everyone. We're not recession proof, but when we look particularly in the balance of our portfolio, it's designed intentionally with age-restricted communities and all age communities because over the long period of time, we find that our growth is best with that balance. And so when you just look at the age-restricted communities, we do get more turnover when there are very challenging periods of economic. All age. I'm sorry, all-age economic downturns, but it's more than made up by the increased desire for affordable housing. So when we look through all the various economic downturns, the great financial crisis, others, some of our strongest growth is post those economic downturns. So again, not recession proof, but very, very resilient and a great opportunity, I think, like other -- unlike other asset classes to bounce back pretty strong. And then when we talk about things that we look at, like bad debt, we look back 18 years, which we did recently. And the range has averaged -- bad debt has averaged around 100 basis points, 110 basis points from a low of about 60 basis points to a high of 140 basis points annually during that 18-year period of time. And if I go back in my notes, that's pretty similar to how it goes. So John, you might want to add some color to what you're seeing. And why did we choose 18 years? Because John McLaren, our Chief Operating Officer, started here 18 years ago. Actually, John, unfortunately, I don't have that figure right in front of me. It's something that we can follow back up with you on after the call. I apologize for that. Yes. I mean it's been -- I would characterize it as over the course of the quarter, if I look at the revenue and what we've done between April, May and June, it has consistently been picking up, and that's been a result of the lifting of the stay at home orders and the -- and those limitations that we've had. And I think it speaks to what Gary said a lot -- many times, which is the pent-up demand that's out there for people to get out. And we clearly see that looking at sequentially each of the months. And so without having the actual figure, I know the occupancy has ticked up, and I see that in the revenue, but we can, again, circle back on those figures for you. Well, you used the word bet. We don't tend to bet a little bit. We like to be as precise as we possibly can. And it's difficult to have clarity, okay, in an environment that's pretty unprecedented. And it's scary, by the way. But I can share with you, though, is post-2008, we didn't see a spike beyond that range. And for a period of time, we've been operating in that range. I think that Karen can share with you some of the metrics because we have thought through a little bit of reserve and accruing for bad debt, but I don't think that it's anything that far out of that range. John, it is very fluid, but we can share with you because we do discuss this. And like all of you, we are wondering what's going to happen with the stimulus package, what's going to happen with unemployment. But there is nothing that we're seeing out of what we've shared with you where we could discuss now some vulnerability, if you will, other than the small piece that Karen shared to be conservative and on the unemployment side, there's nothing on collections. In fact, it was somewhat unusual for us to receive the request that we received for prepayment in full of the rent deferral. John, what was the percentage of that? 17%. Whereby they had 12 months to really pay this back. So interestingly enough, it's almost as if there's some conservatism by some of our residents who want to know currently that they can pay back that deferral that gives us a little bit comfort, if you will, and how we're going to navigate these uncertain times. Well, generally, we don't forecast acquisition volume other than to refer to what we've done in the previous years. We're well ahead of pace where we expected to be based on last year's acquisitions with the exemption of the Jensen portfolio. And I would simply state with $132 million closed on so far this year, we should be able to significantly exceed that with what we closed this year. And if anything overlaps into next year, we'll be glad to share this. But for right now, I can only say that our pipeline is extremely full. We are very pleased that we will be able to match up the equity growth capital that we raised to the potential acquisitions, and the timing is really hard to forecast. Sure. I referenced it a little bit with how similar their RV business has been. But despite tight restrictions over in Australia and certainly within their internal borders, Ingenia really has continued to perform really well during these challenging times. Last quarter, they announced that total year-to-date home sales were $240 million with another 30 expected to close prior to their year-end, which was June 30. So if they close those around 270 home sales should have closed. On the Sun Ingenia development joint venture, we've been slower to deploy our capital over there than our original goal but we continue to wait for some delayed entitlement approvals that are delayed in some part due to the COVID situation there as well.  Our first project, Freshwater in a place called Burpengary. We've closed 7 new homes, generating gross proceeds of about AUD 2.5 million with an additional 15 homes under contract in deposit now which are being constructed. Some delay again through COVID but on track to deliver the kind of results and returns that we hope for in that development. And then I mentioned RV, a few comments before. Similar to what we've experienced in the U.S., but looking forward, now that everything is open, the travel restrictions have been lifted with the exception of one area. 12-month bookings are strong, and they're indicating a revenue increase year-over-year of just over 24%. So they're continuing to perform well. They're getting ready to report on their year-end results, and I'm looking forward to seeing them as much of the market is. Well, we want to thank all of you for taking the time out to join us today. We believe Sun's actions in response to this unprecedented period of time ensure that our business is strong through and on the other side of this pandemic. So we look forward to speaking to you at the end of next quarter. And as I always conclude, Fernando, John, myself and Karen are always available for any follow-up questions. Thank you, operator."

            "name": "John McLaren",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Despite the challenges presented to our business by the pandemic, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. Quick implementation of our emergency preparedness plan, cost containment efforts and better-than-expected manufactured housing revenues mitigated the financial to our second quarter results. From a total portfolio perspective, we gained 851 revenue-producing sites, a 27% increase over the second quarter 2019, boosting total occupancy to 97.3%. Moreover, the financial hardship program implemented for April and May rent is now in the 12-month installment repayment period, and we are happy to report that over 17% of total deferred rent has already been collected and approximately 400 residents have paid their deferred rent in full.  Our same community portfolio demonstrated resilience in the second quarter. NOI grew by 1.4%, resulting from a 1.8% decline in revenues and an 8% decline in expenses due to delayed seasonal opening of a number of RV resorts and portfolio-wide measures taken at the property level to reduce variable expenses. Manufactured housing revenues increased by 6%, driven by a 3.9% weighted average rental rate increase year-over-year and occupancy gains over the last 12 months. Annual RV revenues increased by 3.2% and transient RV revenue declined by 37%, largely due to delayed openings at our resorts during the quarter as discussed previously. On the expense side, we experienced reductions across payroll and health benefits driven by furloughs and delayed seasonal hiring, utilities and certain maintenance items given restricted access to most amenities. Variable expense savings realized in the second quarter are expected to be lower in the second half of the year as furloughed and seasonal team members return to work and amenities that were not accessible in the second quarter due to state and local restrictions are returned to service.  Same community occupancy improved 190 basis points to 98.7%, reflecting almost 2,300 revenue-producing site gains over the last 12 months. Additionally, our rental program exhibited resilience with a 17% increase in applications to rent-a-home from Sun and an elevated rental home renewal rate of 68.2% in the quarter. Total applications were up almost 5% year-over-year. This demonstrates the continued strength of our platform and the demand to live in a Sun community.  With regard to rent collection, net of hardship deferrals and prepaid balances, manufactured housing collections averaged 97% for the second quarter and are at 96% as of July 21. These collection percentages are in line with 2019 figures as of the same dates. Additionally, over the second quarter, collections averaged approximately 98% for annual RV site rent, also in line with the second quarter of 2019. These strong collection figures across the portfolio are indicative of the resilience and predictability of our balanced portfolio of manufactured housing and RV communities.  Moving on to home sales, in the second quarter, we sold 611 homes as compared to 927 homes last year. Shelter in place restrictions and the inability to show homes physically contributed to the year-over-year decline. While pre-owned home sales were down, new home sales revenues grew 15%, and our gross margin expanded by 7% in the quarter, driven by the sale of 140 new homes. Our average new home price increased 14% over last year to $137,000. We believe that our manufactured home price point and high-quality communities are likely to make Sun a preferred provider of affordable detached housing today and in the post-COVID economy. Our RV business, particularly our transient RV business has shown steady improvement week after week as travel restrictions were lifted throughout the quarter. We have seen an acceleration in website visits, call volume and reservations. For example, Memorial Day weekend trends in RV revenues were down 39% as compared to last year, while transient RV revenues for the fourth of July weekend were down just 5.5% compared to last year. In addition, forward bookings for the month of September and October are trending greater than 10% growth over the same period last year.  Gary referred to the strong projected RV sales figures and trending media coverage surrounding the growth and demand for the RV lifestyle over the past few months. We are bullish on RV vacationing and have seen the follow-through from our guests and our forward bookings. We believe that most other travel options, including air travel and cruises, could take longer to return to pre-COVID levels. Given the breadth and high-quality of the resorts we own, we are well-positioned to benefit from the increasing popularity of the RV lifestyle and vacation option. We offer an excellent product and our resort performance during this challenging time reinforces the importance of this business to our overall platform.  We are resolute in our view of the long-term viability of our mission and our business model. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of affordable housing and the desirability of competitively priced and safer vacation options for consumers. Sun, in many ways, has set the standard, and we remain at the forefront of providing a quality experience to fulfill this need. I would now like to turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial results and balance sheet preparedness. Sure. This is John. So I mean I will tell you that 2020 has been, as you can see with the results, a bit challenging on the RV conversion standpoint, and a lot of that's because the healthy respect that we've had for social distancing, and we've had to temporarily -- we had to temporarily maybe not interact so much with our guests face-to-face, which is very much how we secure RV conversions. Many of our southern conversions happen -- generally happen at the end of March, mid-April and northern conversions, most of those happen in early in June and early July. So the timing wasn't great as well. But that said, the reason why we've been so successful converting transient to annual is because guests love coming to our resorts. So I think once things settle down and we get closer to normal again, that conversion activity will resume. Yes. Every resort is open. We do have some sites in Ontario that are still not available for transient guests. And we've just got a few communities out in California where they're -- there are some limitations as the number of transient or short-term guests that you can have at any given time. So we still got a little bit of that going on right now. Well, we actually -- in the quarter, we actually added additional sites to some of the developments that we had done from ground up that we'd opened up last year. I am excited to say that Larkspur, which is in Colorado, opened up their sites in the second quarter, which is a big thing for us because it's very well-located just south of Denver. And we will look to add additional site deliveries for those ground ups in phases over the course of this year. And we are solidly in the ground. In fact, I just saw it myself a week ago at Costa Vista in San Diego, should be coming out of the ground early next year as far as opening is concerned. Yes. The only color I'd add, Gary, is just that sort of on the overwhelming side, meaning the number of people that are coming to our communities, Josh, I mean, we're already seeing it as far as the application counts that we've gotten for the second quarter having a total apps up 5% in the midst of this quarter-over-quarter as well as rental home applications being up 17%. Our off the street sales applications are up 22%. And so like Gary said, recession resistance is a good way to characterize it because in the end, there are going to be people that maybe are in different forms of housing, okay, that come into our product than what we've seen over time. Yes, we lose a few people marginally from an occupancy standpoint, but we overwhelmingly offset it with the number of people that are coming into our product. That's been the experience over that period of time, the 18 years, Gary is talking about. And so it's -- we feel pretty optimistic about what the future holds from that respect. I cut my teeth in collections in this business. Okay. But in your prepared remarks, it sounded like transient RV was trending ahead of last year, excluding the July 4 weekend. Is that correct? This might be helpful because, John, your question is a question we're studying all the time as we look at our business platform and how we're approaching it. But one thing we've discovered when we talk about resilience that through downturns in the economy, gas prices that have been approaching $5 a gallon, if those of you who can remember that far back, I can. Swings in RV annual sales. Those measures, as we look back historically, revenues have grown in our RV communities on an average of 90 to 100 basis points greater than our manufactured housing business over a 10, 15, 20 year period of time.  So I think that while we're not brushing aside the impact of the pandemic, fundamentally, as John used the word bullish, we're really proponents of how resilient the RV business is going to be both annual and transient as the strong demand comes back. And we're seeing that both here in our portfolio and in our investment over in Australia, where it's pretty much forward reservations in Australia, which I reviewed the other day, are up 24% for the forward 12-month period of time, and they struggled also through closures of their internal borders, travel restrictions and stay-at-home mandates. So I think that we feel very, very good about how our RV transient and annual business will perform subject to the uncertainty of governmental actions and things like that as the pandemic goes forward. And we're also cognizant of the changing environment daily of what's going on with the virus. You mean for revenue-producing sites, John? Well, I think that puts us for the year at roughly 1,150 plus or minus -- actually, 1,151 sites that we've gained year-to-date. So I think our original guidance was somewhere -- I think it was about 2,600 is what we had in original guidance. So I guess the way I'd answer that question is some of it's going to be -- we had a really good second quarter on the RPS front and gaining sites. It was higher than last year, as we shared in the remarks. I think that some of it is just dependent upon, as Gary mentioned, everything is subject to what happens going forward in the pandemic, but based on the application counts, it's difficult for me to give you really sort of a guidance number of what it would be at this time. But I think that yes. It's just -- I think it's still a little bit early, John, to provide that right now. But I am pleased with where we're at. It is close to where we were. I think it's about 100 sites shorter than where we were last year at this time. So we're in striking distance of being in the range. Yes. This is John. So we actually -- that -- we cut it off in June, but we have not had a lot of requests for the program and part of the reason why we did end it in June was because those had trailed off significantly. So I -- at this point in time, again, it's hard to say. But at this point in time, we don't have any expectations that we would have to reengage that program. 17%. I think it's also important, just again, to kind of go on back in history to look at what we shared in terms of the resilience of the business. I mean they were fairly tough times in the early 2000s that we went through, still grew. There were tough times through the global financial crisis. We still grew, okay? And so it's again, it goes back to the fact of what is it we have, we have affordable vacation, we have affordable housing, we have a product that is needed in all economic cycles, okay? And so it's just a matter of -- it doesn't -- to us, it's resistant because it doesn't really matter what the economic cycle is, the need is always there. And we're seeing that come through with our application counts and all the other things that we've shared along the way, too, John. Yes. This is John. So we've already implemented the rent increase process again, John. One of the things that we've always said is that the most important -- the best revenue-producing site you can gain is the one you never lose. And so we've been very thoughtful, very careful in terms of the rent increase for 2020 with the goal of doing what's right for all of Sun's stakeholders. So -- but we have engaged that process."

At this time, management would like me to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions and the company can provide no assurance that its expectations will be achieved.

The company undertakes no obligation to advise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release. Having said that, I would like to introduce management with us today; Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John McLaren, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Karen Dearing, Chief Financial Officer. After their remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results and provide an update on Sun's preparedness to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Since our fourth quarter call in mid-February, the environment has been dramatically challenged by a worldwide public health crisis. And before we begin, we wish to convey our sincere wishes for everyone's health and safety. We started the first quarter of 2020 ahead of expectations, reporting FFO per share of $1.22, $0.01 ahead of the high end of guidance. While everyone is focused on how the pandemic will affect our performance over the coming weeks and months, it's important to note that we entered the year from a position of strength and because of the underlying fundamentals of providing affordable housing and vacationing options; we expect to sustain a relative position of strength as we navigate through the pandemic. We began 2020 with total portfolio occupancy of 96.7% are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective, with approximately $380 million of unrestricted cash as of quarter end and a trailing net debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.6x. We want to commend and recognize our team and acknowledge the incredible job they have done stepping up and responding during this challenging time. Our team acted swiftly to ensure that Sun was doing its part to stem the spread of Coronavirus by adopting work from home practices at our main office and wherever possible at our communities. At our properties, we close the amenities where residents and guests gather and implemented recommended sanitation and hygiene protocols, while prioritizing health and safety by adhering to social distancing parameters, we're striving to provide Sun's trademark customer service. Given current shelter in place and social distancing orders, we do not know nor are we in control of the duration of the current changes in operating conditions brought on by the pandemic. However, we can adjust certain controllable operating expenses, modify our capital deployment plans and manage our liquidity. On the expense side, since Directors and Executive Officers have set the tone by electing to forego their compensation for at least the second quarter. The balance of our main office team members have also taken salary reductions and recognizing that we are all in this together. Additionally, we have placed a number of our team members on furlough, due to the closing of our amenities in the temporary reduction of transactions. The company will continue to pay both its share and the team member share of costs associated with providing each furloughed team members, uninterrupted healthcare benefits. We have implemented a rent forbearance program for residents financially impacted by the virus. We have elected to apply and provide the necessary information related to their hardship in order to qualify for the program. Approximately 2.9% of our manufactured housing residence, inclusive of our rental home program have applied and been approved. Requests from our annual RV guests have been minimal. In our manufactured housing portfolio, we have collected 98% of our rents as of April 22, which is on par with last month and prior year. In our RV portfolio, approximately 55% of our RV sites are leased annual sites. For annual RV rents currently due collections are at 92% relative to the percent collected at the same time last year. Of the remaining 45% of RV sites, which are transient, we're experiencing an impact from a pandemic with delayed resort openings and cancelled reservations. John will provide additional detail. Given limited visibility and the return to normal operating conditions and the duration of the current situation, we're suspending our 2020 financial and operating guidance. We've also determined it prudent to temporarily reduce or suspend certain capital spend and expansions in ground up developments and we continue to evaluate acquisitions with measured caution. John and Karen will provide further details on the unavoidable financial impact associated with the pandemic. However, we believe that even in the times of uncertainty or disruption, Sun's portfolio and the industry in which we operate, are well suited to withstand the impacts of a recession. Sun provides a high quality affordable housing option that has historically demonstrated stability and resilience during a downturn and a stronger earlier bounce back to recovery as the macro economy improved or different circumstances caused the great financial crisis in 2008. The underlying business model at Sun and the demand for affordable housing which Sun provides resulted in significant growth in the five years after the GFC. We anticipate that our RV Resort business will demonstrate a similar pattern, as it provides similar affordability in a market with proven strong demand and limited supply. Our RV Resorts provide an affordable vacation option where guests can travel an average of two to three hours safely in their own vehicles without the need to get on a plane, stay in a hotel or congregate in a public space. For now, the pandemic has galvanized our operations team to stay ahead of the situation and steer us in the right direction. They need daily to ensure that residents, guests and Sun team members are receiving compassion and unparalleled service during these times. They monitor local shelter in place mandates and are literally writing the playbook on how to navigate this fluid situation. There is no precedent for what the world or the Sun is experiencing. We've had to make some extremely difficult but necessary decisions to ensure that Sun continues to be the nation's premier, owner operator of manufacturer housing in RV communities. John and Karen will now provide additional operational and financial updates. John?\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. I'll start with a recap on the strong performance and metrics in the first quarter, after which I'll provide specific details regarding the impact of the pandemic on operations, financials and the actions we've taken. As Gary mentioned, we're tracking strongly ahead of expectations for the quarter and delivered excellent same community growth, even after absorbing disruptions from the onset of shelter in place ordinances in mid to late March. Our total portfolio ended the first quarter 96.7% occupied, improving 30 basis points over last year and we added 300 revenue producing sites, even as shelter in place restrictions were put into effect. Our same community NOI increased 6.7% year-over-year, driven by 5.2% increase in same community revenues and a 1.8% increase in same community expenses. Same community manufactured housing revenue growth was 6.2%; annual RV revenues grew by 9.6%; and transient RV revenues decreased by 6% as we felt the first effects of COVID-19 related social distancing orders in March. In the first quarter, we saw same community occupancy increase to 98.4% from 96.6% in the first quarter of 2019. Even as social distancing began to impact traffic at our properties, home sales are quite strong with sales of 763 homes of which 119 were new homes and 234 rental home conversions. A core strength to Sun's operations team is the continual emphasis on refining our contingency planning and emergency preparedness and disaster recovery protocols, which are in place to rapidly deal with various out of the ordinary circumstances. By late February, the team began deploying recommended protocols throughout the portfolio and assessing how best the balance compliance with health related orders and the delivery of essential services to our residents and guests, which dictated a number of changes in the field. The steps we implemented are aimed to help ensure the safety of our residents, guests and team members assist our residents who are facing extreme financial challenges and to support our local communities wherever we can. In terms of health and safety, we seamlessly implemented work from home for all positions that can be remote. We enhanced our cleaning protocols, closed public amenities and discontinued social gatherings. Our onsite offices remain available for essential services. We have also stepped up our communications and virtual servicing options for current and prospective residents. We have adopted a financial hardship program to provide forbearance under certain terms to residents impacted financially by the pandemic and temporarily suspend evictions, late fees and rental rate increase. For residents to qualify for the financial hardship program, rent will be deferred through May and be payable in 12 equal installments beginning in July 2020. We estimate the deferred rent equates to $1.9 million for each of the two months and it includes resident owned homes on sites and our manufactured housing rental units. Now I'll provide some details related to the current quarter that will help frame our best estimate of financial expectations with regard to the actions just described and the impact of the pandemic. We are very pleased with the [indiscernible] rent collections, in our manufactured housing portfolio as Gary indicated earlier, we have collected 90% of our April rent today. While we're experiencing lower traffic at the communities as would be expected with shelter in place mandates, we're still seeing demand for movements and actually expect fewer move outs during this time. For the month of April, while total application count is down approximately 13% on a year-over-year basis, web applications are up 111% and represent 45% total applications compared to only 19% April the prior year. Our technology platform has the capability to capture online applications and steer prospective residents use Sun's web services. Our platform also has the capabilities to provide remote virtual home showings and tours allowing us to nimbly adapt in the face of this evolving landscape. Now we would like to provide some perspective in our RV portfolio. Our portfolio consists of over 26,000 annual sites and approximately 22,000 transient sites. The annual RV sites are located in resorts that are open year round, as well as resorts that are open on a seasonal basis. The majority of our annual sites are either Park models or sites where RVs are tied down and the guests has made significant investments in personalizing their sites by building decks, indoor outdoor rooms, and porches and installing landscaping and hardscaping essentially making these very permanent nature. These guests return year-after-year so what is typically their vacation home. On the transient side of our RV business, it has been our experience for more than 25 years, the most of Sun's transient RV guests enjoy the convenience and safety of driving in their own vehicle to a vacation destination they're familiar with and comfortable at. Based on many years of operating experience and engagement with our transient guests, we believe they are likely to return to our resorts when shelter in place and non-essential travel restrictions are lifted. Historically, over 50% of our transient RV guests returns the same resort each year, providing a predictable and steady income stream. For the time being, however, we have received an increased number of reservation cancellations related to shelter in place directly. Additionally, we have 44 RV resorts that would have been open on around April 1, but are being prohibited from opening by local authorities. As of now, we expect these resorts to open at various points in May as restrictions are lifted. Thus far for May and June, guests are calling frequently inquiring about our opening date and taking a wait and see approach with regard to their planned vacations. Forecasting for what we know related to cancellations bookings, resorts that are not currently open in effect that Memorial Day weekend is included in this quarter. Our best estimate for the second quarter includes a reduction of $10 million transient revenue from our original budget expectations. In addition to this forecasted reduction in transient RV revenue just discussed based on the current environment, there are a number of additional revenue sources that could be impacted temporarily. These include lower manufactured housing revenue due to rental increases being deferred and lower occupancy gains. Lower annual RV revenue related to fewer transients annual site conversions and the associated rent pickup. Lower other and ancillary income due to various fees not being collected as a result of delayed resort openings, and lower home sales and brokerage fees as a result of stay at home orders and travel restrictions. Despite the near-term disruption to our operations, we are confident in the long-term viability of our mission and business model, which has stood the test of time throughout many of the most difficult economic times and downturns over the life of the industry. During those periods, this industry has been characterized by its steady, predictable cash flow, fueled by strong consumer demand for homeownership, as well as the demand for affordable vacationing. I would now like to turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial results, balance sheet and provide a summary of the potential impact to our second quarter as a result of the pandemic. Karen?\nKaren Dearing: Thank you, John. I will begin by reviewing our financial results followed by a discussion of our balance sheet as well as the estimated financial implications, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business operations and the actions we have taken to-date. For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we reported $1.22 per share in core funds from operations, $0.01 ahead of the top-end of our previously provided guidance range for the quarter. We ended the first quarter with approximately $380 million of unrestricted cash on hand after we completed a 15-year $230 million term loan at a rate of 3% that closed at the end of March. The properties for this new financing had been encumbered by a $99.6 million term loan due to mature in 2021, with an interest rate of 5.84% that was paid off at the end of February. Additionally, we paid off for term loans totaling approximately $20 million that were set to mature this year. We have no material debt maturities until 2023. We ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 3.64% and a weighted average maturity of 10.6 years. Our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio at March 31 was 5.6x. We also have flexibility on our balance sheet to support our business operations. As of March 31, we had $223 million of capacity on our revolving line of credit and have the ability to increase the size of our facility by $350 million to $1.1 billion. Also, our significant unencumbered asset base comprised of 143 properties provides us with additional potential funding capacity. We took decisive measures to reduce our cash spend for the remainder of 2020. We have suspended non-essential capital expenditures of $240 million, including expansions ground up development, home purchases and other capital projects. From a corporate perspective, we've made compensation reductions at the board and executive management level and implemented other compensation savings throughout the company through salary reductions and furloughing certain team members. We've reviewed our general and administrative cost line items and reduced expenses where possible. From the operations perspective, we continue to maintain our properties at the highest level, but may see a reduction in certain variable operating costs. More broadly, when taking into consideration the disruptions to our business in both our manufactured housing and RV Resort operations discussed earlier by John and including projected expense savings, the forecasted reduction to our original budget for the second quarter is between $15 million to $18 million. As we said earlier, the pandemic is a fluid situation. As shelter in place and travel restrictions are lifted, we expect to see an improvement in our level of transient RV reservations and our second quarter forecast. But for now, we've shared what we believed to be our best estimate based on the information we have today. In summary, we've taken a number of actions to support the company should the impact of the pandemic persist. We are confident that we have the financial flexibility to ensure our ability to operate in this unprecedented time. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our prepared remarks. We would like to open the call now for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I was wondering, John, if you could provide some more color on when you think the RV campgrounds will be open as far as the 44 that are not open yet. And how many of those 44 could be opened by Memorial Day?\nJohn McLaren: Hey, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, it's, I mean, that is going to be sort of aligned with the government mandates and as things start to lift along the way, I think we said in our prepared remarks. So we expect that sort of start happening in May. And I think one of the important things with that, John, is the fact that we often talk about our playbook, and the decades we're finding that playbook and all of this situation is just a different version of operating conditions during post natural disasters and hurricanes and things like that, that we deal with. So, as you might imagine, pretty much as soon as this all started to happen, we were preparing our plants for reopening at the same time. And through that, we've developed the three phased plan associated with reopening that will align with those government mandates that all you really have to do is drop in the open date, and it guides to prepare our team leading to opening all the way through normal operations status. And so the plan itself includes proper sequencing of reopening the resorts and the amenities, starting with ones that provide better space or social distancing. So we're really looking forward to welcoming our guests back. But again, that's going to be more along the lines of whatever the governmental authorities allow us to do.\nJohn Kim: Did the $50 million to $80 million range is that just a wide range of outcomes for how many of those open by Memorial Day just given that's a crucial date for your?\nGary Shiffman: It's Gary. I think that we want to be cautious. We have been in touch with the counties, cities and municipalities who have asked us to extend our openings from generally April 1, with the anticipation that they would be opening up and sometime in May. We haven't heard otherwise. So, as of right now, we do expect to get them all opened in the month of May. But that's of course going to be dependent on any change that we hear from the municipalities.\nJohn Kim: Okay. So once the RVs are open, is there anything you're going to do on your end to limit capacity just to, I guess limit human interaction?\nJohn McLaren: Well, one of the interesting things about an RV Resort as opposed to other hospitality options is there's sort of some of that built-in spread, because everybody has their own site that they're on, which promotes all by itself, social distancing. Some of the things that we've done -- some examples of some things, John, that we've already put into play to get ahead of that is, we've actually already stocked social distancing signage for all entry points. So we have what's in our communities, as well as you've seen those before conferences where they put the stickers down on the floors. And we can do that in the more highly trafficked areas to promote that as well. And I think one of the really key things that we're able to do is utilize our Online Express checking capabilities, which allows guests to check in and pay early allowing them for a touchless arrival process as well. So, there's a lot of that sort of thing that's happening. But I think by its very nature and RV Resort promotes a lot of social distancing, right out of the gate. And I also think that, Gary and I both agree that many people are going to want to get out of their houses.\nJohn Kim: Final question is, just on the a bit your ability and confidence on demand for RVs. Just given the amount of character and cancellations that you've received so far?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. I think we -- all sort of feel the same way. We can't brush aside or make light of the financial impact, especially the transient RV from the current pandemic, but we really have to look through to the value of the fundamental business proposition and the platform itself, which is, John sort of indicated we're providing an affordable and cost effective vacation experience in what really is a safe, self-contained RV and we're doing it to all various demographics. So we would expect really on the other side of this unfortunate circumstance that people that are looking for unique and desirable experience like RV offers to both individuals, retirees and families, spending time in our rustic camping resorts or one of our high-end glamping experience really should be in high demand. Anecdotally, I've heard from a least a dozen people over the last two weeks or so, looking to inquire and where to get an RV, of course, if we don't can get them a discount, if we can assist them. But as recent as yesterday, one of our Board Members wanted to let me know that they bought an RV. They've actually left Michigan and they are on their way first to Colorado traveling out to California. So we really feel that the RV business could benefit strongly from this unfortunate situation. And I think we'll see that rather rapidly when the impact of stay at home and travel bans are lifted.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. Appreciate the details on April MH collections, but I'm just curious as we go forward over the next few months if you expect any performance differential given different demand drivers between the all age and the age restricted MH portfolios, then maybe within owned versus rental as well.\nJohn McLaren: Yes. Nick, this is John. I think the way I'd characterize is that with April rent collections that they all age portfolio is showed its resilience. And I think it also benefits along with the rest of the portfolio, sort of the proactive nature of our culture. One of the things that we've said as a company for a decade or longer has been the best revenue producing site you can gain as the one you never lose. And I think everybody knows that. Our average residency in our communities is 14 years, there's a value proposition, there's a reason why people want to be there. From a rent collection standpoint in April, rent collections for all age communities is on par with last month. I mean, and so I think that that really kind of shows coming right into this, when there was a lot of uncertainty coming into this pandemic that that value proposition that people see is realized. The other thing I'd add is a component of the all age portfolio is a bit of a reminder that, that we've shared before that, from a retiree standpoint, or when you compare 55 plus versus all age not every person who is over 55 wants to live in a retirement community. So we have a healthy component of residents within our all age communities that are retirees. And so those folks are going to be less impacted by things like job loss than others. And so, I think looking out -- looking into May, I would add that, I think that our hardship program did what it was designed to do and that takes the pressure off as well. And I would like to think that some of the things that our government has done to help promote what people's needs are with the stimulus plan and the checks that are starting to arrive that I would hope that the experience from May rent collection will be similar to that of April.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then anything on the rental program versus owned in terms of different risk profiles going forward?\nJohn McLaren:  No, I mean, it's really, it's pretty much, it's about 50:50 as far as the utilization of the hardship program. So it was -- it's very similar in nature. I will tell you that an interesting thing that's happened during this terrible crisis has been that with the rental home program our applications in April are actually up versus where they were April of last year.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. So, then just you mentioned the change to expansion and development spend and how does that impact the Australian JV or were those comments just for the U.S.?\nJohn McLaren: Well, speaking to the U.S., really, I think one of the things on our expansion development spend has been the fact that and I think we might have shared this before as well, I apologize for my repeating myself. But we're fortunate that we're always in a position thinking ahead and stay in a year, year and a half ahead of what the supply needs are for expansion sites. As we shared another cause we had 2100 sites built in '17, 1200 sites in '18, 1200 in 2019. And so we've got a good supply of site. So tapering it down for a bit, really shouldn't have an impact.\nGary Shiffman: It's Gary. John's remarks did reflect what's taking place in the U.S. With regard to Ingenious and Australia, it's a little bit of a different business proposition. They've been a little bit less impacted. I'd like to thank maybe that social distancing of the size of the country versus the population allows them a little bit more natural barrier to what we're experiencing here in the U.S. But demand has remained strong, there's been -- as John said, tendency for people who maybe were going to move out of Sun's Communities to kind of postpone those moves and in the sort of opposite way in Australia, they queue up what they refer to as their settlements or the home closings long and advanced. And that's dictated by a residence, home sale, primary home sale, if they're downsizing, they look to downsize to relief equity to be used in their retirement. So it's very, very important to them to understand and know that as they sell their home, they have a place to go. So if anything, there's been a little bit of an acceleration and those who have reservations and plan to move into the Ingenious communities. So that's been a positive thing there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Babin with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Babin: Quick question just related to transient reopenings. I know a lot of the rent premium that you're able to command associated with just upgraded amenities, things like that at the properties. Can you even give a little more detail on kind of amenities might be available upon the opening which amenities may kind of lag and whether as far as there are bookings or any clarity, is that affecting pricing at all?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. I mean sort of the natural sequence Drew with many openings is going to start with ones that are more social distancing promoting, so call it more of the outdoor type stuff that we have out there where there can be less contact. I think some of the things that we're doing in terms of signage, one of the things that we're also doing, we're starting to secure a supply of infrared thermometers, where we can check temperatures as our team comes in for the day and as well as when our guests check in and those sorts of things. And we're actually going to be providing wristbands everybody indicated they've been cleared. Just out of an abundance of caution that we do this and help them to build confidence for our guests coming back because they're excited to come back and they want to be there. And so, that's sort of the sequencing of it. We've not to-date made any adjustments in terms of rate.\nAndrew Babin: Okay. Appreciate the color there. And just one follow-up for me. Just on the pace of expansions and development deliveries. I know you mentioned that online traffic is up, obviously onsite traffic has been down amidst all of this. Is there any kind of update on the pacing of the delivery of revenue producing sites throughout this year, whether its sites that were put in place kind of coming into the year at the end of last year, or ones that you may be planning on adding later this year? Any update there, as we model it out?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. As far as the expansion site delivers, again, I don't think that there's a lot of impact from an availability or supply standpoint. I mean, it really is, from an application standpoint, as we've shared in the remarks, the apps are down only 13% thus far. We've got excellent web-based connectivity to be able to continue to collect applications and as well as do virtual showings and that sort of thing. And frankly, I've seen a lot of great creativity out of our teams out in the field. And so, again, it's going to line up more without being able to tell you exactly what's going to happen. It's all going to line up with no kind of as these things start to ease up a little bit, but in the end, we are still building a pipeline that we will remain engaged with those prospects and customers that when the time comes and we can sort of be it in pace we are used to be in at, then it's all really about the throughput that we do after that.\nAndrew Babin: Thanks, john. I appreciate the transparency on the transient reopening plans. It's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with the question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Maybe just a clarification on the first question. So it sounds like, you can correct me if I'm wrong. It sounds like the $10 million in transient revenue impact assumes, basically zero revenue coming in the door in April and the vast majority of May revenue is still achievable. Is that fair?\nGary Shiffman: I would say that's somewhere in between there.\nKaren Dearing: Yes. That sort of ramps up to highest level in June obviously, but there -- you're correct there's a minimal amount of revenues expected in April and ramping up from there.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then the 98% collections on the MH side in April. Is that a cash or GAAP basis? So roughly 3% of rents are deferred. Or is the cash collection 95 or is the cash collection actually 98?\nJohn McLaren: 98.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Final one for me. So $15 million to $18 million 2Q impact on NOI, 10 million of it coming from the transient side. What kind of impact are you assuming on the MH portfolio in 2Q? Thank you.\nKaren Dearing: Okay. So John, we knew that providing that estimated impacted dollar amount was going to lead you to be wanting some more details. We felt it was the right thing to do. And so we've done it, our effort was to provide as much detail as we could. Therefore, these are the things that we have included, transient revenue reduction of 10 million that makes up the majority of the range. And the remaining $5 million to $8 million is split between home sales and brokerage, other and ancillary, annual revenues and MH revenues. It's net of expense reductions.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Understood. Are you assuming at this point that you see any diminution in occupancy on the MH portfolio?\nJohn McLaren: No.\nJohn Pawlowski: All right. Sounds good. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nWes Golladay: How was financing availability changing for home sells? Are you seeing any changes on that?\nJohn McLaren: No, I haven't.\nGary Shiffman: But it hasn't been good before. It hasn't gotten any better. It hasn't gotten any worse.\nWes Golladay: Fair enough. Will still be doing any more on that on that front helping in it?\nGary Shiffman: I think that we actually have a subcommittee on our Board of Directors that is really focused on improving the availability of home financing. They were on track to be able to work through probably the first manufacturer housing, loan securitization at the end of second quarter. I know John's worked very hard on it. Do we have any more color at this time?\nJohn McLaren: Not at this time.\nGary Shiffman: Yes. So we will keep everybody posted, but the home financing today is pretty much the same as it was two months ago.\nWes Golladay: Got you. Okay. Then looking at the [indiscernible] the increased unemployment benefits that many of the tenant should receive? Will you need to extend that hardship program beyond May and hold off on rent increases? And then a quick addition to that, one is how many leases in MH expire in 2Q?\nJohn McLaren: Well, that's a good question, because that's precisely why we designed the program to include April and May because the thought process was with a hardship program and it was going to be very difficult for people to go out and find jobs in April. And so, we wanted to kind of wrap it over both of those months. And as we talked about in our prepared remarks, begin the payments, lighter payments starting over a 12-month period of time in July. So I think that provides a lot of support for our residents. My hope would be that that will one promote, like I said earlier on this call, good May rent collections as well as put some things at ease for people, as they're kind of putting things back together when the pandemic starts to hopefully taper down.\nGary Shiffman: The rank collections by quarter, does someone have those available or rent increases renewals?\nKaren Dearing: I'm sorry, what was the last part of your question was?\nWes Golladay: I'm sorry just the expirations that can't be expired this quarter.\nKaren Dearing: I don't have the detail of that number.\nWes Golladay: No problem. And then, maybe one last one. What is the typical booking window for transient RV?\nJohn McLaren: It's a pretty wide range. I mean, it can be anywhere from a year in advance and a lot of people that are booking before they even leave the resort from the year before it could be the day of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Maybe just a follow up on the last question, for MH rent increases, do those all go through on January 1, or are they staggered throughout the year? And if so, have you considered maybe not pushing through any rent increase for people this year?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. So the increases that are out there about 50% is what happens in the first quarter. And so those are already out Josh. And then, we have put a hole on further rent increases until things start to open up or ease up a little bit. And so I think, when you look at this sort of overall, it could have about maybe a 50 basis point impact on the guided rent increase for 2020. That's our best estimate at this point in time.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. And that's all related to MH communities, where is that also with RV communities for annuals?\nJohn McLaren: It's both.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Both, okay. And then if the pandemic goes on for longer and maybe if things can start opening up in May on the RV side. Has there been any thought given to how you would respond as far as like, if people can't access their sites on the RV side, maybe like reducing their rent for the year, anything on that front?\nGary Shiffman: I think it's something that we talked about and something that we're just going -- have to watch and continue to see what does take place just like across the country. But we have been conservative in our thought process through the quarter slowly ramping up as we indicated earlier, we have deferred rental increases for the time being. We have eliminated all fees related delay charges, various other fees that we often do collect and try to be there for our residents. As john said, our residents are there long-term and so it'll just be a work in process. If things continue on, we're going to have to be able to provide additional transparency to you and to the market. But we do think that we really did take a very good hard look at our best estimates. And that's what we put forward with the concept of what we know now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please proceed you’re your question.\nTodd Stender: Hi, everyone. I hope you're all well.\nGary Shiffman: Thanks.\nTodd Stender: Thanks. So back to the hardship program. You guys are talking about April and May tenants then pick up in July. What about June? How does it seems like they jumped over June but maybe not.\nJohn McLaren: Yes. So sort of like what Gary said just a minute ago. I mean, I think that we launched the program even before April rent was due trying to think of ahead of it. So we are thinking about that, but the thought process was to just cover April and May based on the data that we had at the time, that's out there to try and set up the program, so it sort of fits with the various models that are out there. And to provide some space between when things hopefully start to slow down, when people have to start making payments back. And so I would say as far as June is concerned and tied, I mean, it's something that we will closely monitor as things evolve or emerge as we need to.\nGary Shiffman: So if they were to start making their first rental payment in June, we didn't want to burden them with the forbearance pay back, so that's why we delayed an additional 30 days. And that's also why we took the route of 12 equal payments to extend it over the longest period of time to make it easiest on the residents.\nTodd Stender: All right. Thank you. So April and May will begin being paid back in July, but June will be just your standard June payment.\nJohn McLaren: Absolutely right.\nTodd Stender: Got it. Thank you. Appreciate that. And then for going based compensation for the board and executives give any numbers around this just for us to look and start looking at our G&A estimate going forward.\nGary Shiffman: We don't really have numbers and…\nKaren Dearing: Had to add them up really quickly in my head. They just came out in the proxy Todd, I think you can add them up and take a quarter of that.\nTodd Stender: Okay. So it's one quarters worth for now [indiscernible].\nKaren Dearing: Yes.\nTodd Stender: Okay.\nGary Shiffman: We were very pleased proactively, our Board of Directors reached out to us very early on in the situation and wanted to do whatever they could and obviously, from a distance and strategically they've done some, but they continue to do some, but they were able to contribute financially in this way.\nTodd Stender: Okay. Finally, just for Karen, your line of credit balance ramped, but also certainly your balance. Have you spelled out how much you've tapped just kind of sit on cash to preserve liquidity right now?\nKaren Dearing: I'm sorry, I missed the last part. Todd.\nTodd Stender: Well, taping your line? How much is that? Are you just sitting on cash just to preserve liquidity right now?\nKaren Dearing: And also, you're right, we had $380 million of unrestricted cash on hand. We just finished the $230 million financing. We drew about $200 million additionally on our line, and we haven't drawn subsequent to quarter end. We feel like that is enough to meet our near term needs. We did our distribution in April. So we think that balance, less distributions, I think we did about $70 million, $75 million in distributions puts us in a good position to have the flexibility we need at this point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSamir Khanal: I guess for Gary for you. Do you have any early reads as to what the impact is done to maybe, underwriting for new deals or kind of unlevered IRS cap rates and you've acquired a lot in the last few years and on the other side of this, could you see the opportunity to maybe pick up any asset? I just want to kind of get your initial thoughts here.\nGary Shiffman: That's excellent question. I would state the following that we have seen significant interest in three different areas. We're seeing several types of communities that until recent events were not likely to be for sale. So that's been probably the biggest surprise, properties that were or have been for sale, but we're not priced appropriately. We're getting a lot of inbound traffic and entering in dialogue and discussions as to whether or not those are things we want to look at right now. And then properties that could have been acquired, but we didn't act on or we weren't proactive to getting to them. They're starting to surface. So I think the overall responses that we are seeing kind of a turned up interest in acquisition offerings. And as I said in my earlier remarks, we're taking a very cautious approach to those acquisitions. But I think that for the time being, we're seeing a more realistic approach to how sellers might be thinking about their valuations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO. Please proceed with the question.\nJohn Kim: Thanks. Just a follow up. On your suspension of rent increases in MH, what would be the catalyst or catalysts to return back to your projected escalations? Would they be macro economic factors or metrics tied specifically within your portfolio?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. Anyways, we've talked about this. I think their metrics specifically tied to our portfolio. Sitting in March along with the rest of the world, we had no idea how our residents or when our residents would be paying April rent. We've gotten through April rent, really pleasantly pleased. We've now got a look at May assuming that we see continued strength with our residents and the desire to stay in the communities. We'll take it one month at a time. And I think it will be a combination of what we see in the macro world as well as how we feel about the quality of what we're offering against other opportunities and being compassionate to our residents who have stuck by us and we want to continue sticking by us. So it's a fluid situation and something John and the ops team will have to present to management here and making a full decision as we step forward really month by month. And the first thing we'd like to accomplish, as we shared with everybody is to get our transients seasonal -- our transient business back in our seasonal communities open. I think having that step behind us will be a positive thing and how we approach when or if we put in rental increases.\nOperator: Next question comes from Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Joseph: Just want to follow up on I guess the transient and seasonal revenues. Appreciate the color for the second quarter expectations, but just curious what the scope of revenue that's been received, that could be potentially refunded if the properties open later than expected there [indiscernible] remained longer than expected. Thanks.\nGary Shiffman: I don't think the concept of refunding has been anything that we are expecting. And I think that if anything, we're to approach that magnitude or discussion.\nJohn McLaren: I think it's also Nick important to note that the vast majority of the seasonal or the annual site and the seasonal resorts, those sites remain occupied 12 months of the year. Like we shared in the script where it's either a park model or it's a tied down unit where they've done significant investment in their sites. And so similar to MH, it's a very significant investment that's been made by them. So I think that a lot of -- frankly, they expect to pay the rent.\nGary Shiffman: So, it's not something we've been actually kind of planning at this time.\nOperator: At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for closing comment.\nGarry Shiffman: I just want to wrap it up by thanking everybody for participating on this call. We've shared and firmly believe that Sun is well positioned to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide a highly desirable experience that our communities and our resorts and we continue to have access to capital and are dedicated to see this through. As always, Karen, John, myself and others in the company remain around to follow-up with any questions that you have. And we look forward to updating you in the near future. Thank you, Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

I will begin by reviewing our financial results followed by a discussion of our balance sheet as well as the estimated financial implications, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business operations and the actions we have taken to-date. For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we reported $1.22 per share in core funds from operations, $0.01 ahead of the top-end of our previously provided guidance range for the quarter. We ended the first quarter with approximately $380 million of unrestricted cash on hand after we completed a 15-year $230 million term loan at a rate of 3% that closed at the end of March. The properties for this new financing had been encumbered by a $99.6 million term loan due to mature in 2021, with an interest rate of 5.84% that was paid off at the end of February. Additionally, we paid off for term loans totaling approximately $20 million that were set to mature this year. We have no material debt maturities until 2023. We ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 3.64% and a weighted average maturity of 10.6 years. Our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio at March 31 was 5.6x. We also have flexibility on our balance sheet to support our business operations. As of March 31, we had $223 million of capacity on our revolving line of credit and have the ability to increase the size of our facility by $350 million to $1.1 billion. Also, our significant unencumbered asset base comprised of 143 properties provides us with additional potential funding capacity. We took decisive measures to reduce our cash spend for the remainder of 2020. We have suspended non-essential capital expenditures of $240 million, including expansions ground up development, home purchases and other capital projects. From a corporate perspective, we've made compensation reductions at the board and executive management level and implemented other compensation savings throughout the company through salary reductions and furloughing certain team members. We've reviewed our general and administrative cost line items and reduced expenses where possible. From the operations perspective, we continue to maintain our properties at the highest level, but may see a reduction in certain variable operating costs. More broadly, when taking into consideration the disruptions to our business in both our manufactured housing and RV Resort operations discussed earlier by John and including projected expense savings, the forecasted reduction to our original budget for the second quarter is between $15 million to $18 million. As we said earlier, the pandemic is a fluid situation. As shelter in place and travel restrictions are lifted, we expect to see an improvement in our level of transient RV reservations and our second quarter forecast. But for now, we've shared what we believed to be our best estimate based on the information we have today. In summary, we've taken a number of actions to support the company should the impact of the pandemic persist. We are confident that we have the financial flexibility to ensure our ability to operate in this unprecedented time. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our prepared remarks. We would like to open the call now for questions. Yes. That sort of ramps up to highest level in June obviously, but there -- you're correct there's a minimal amount of revenues expected in April and ramping up from there. Okay. So John, we knew that providing that estimated impacted dollar amount was going to lead you to be wanting some more details. We felt it was the right thing to do. And so we've done it, our effort was to provide as much detail as we could. Therefore, these are the things that we have included, transient revenue reduction of 10 million that makes up the majority of the range. And the remaining $5 million to $8 million is split between home sales and brokerage, other and ancillary, annual revenues and MH revenues. It's net of expense reductions. I'm sorry, what was the last part of your question was? I don't have the detail of that number. Had to add them up really quickly in my head. They just came out in the proxy Todd, I think you can add them up and take a quarter of that. Yes. I'm sorry, I missed the last part. Todd. And also, you're right, we had $380 million of unrestricted cash on hand. We just finished the $230 million financing. We drew about $200 million additionally on our line, and we haven't drawn subsequent to quarter end. We feel like that is enough to meet our near term needs. We did our distribution in April. So we think that balance, less distributions, I think we did about $70 million, $75 million in distributions puts us in a good position to have the flexibility we need at this point in time."

            "content": "Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results and provide an update on Sun's preparedness to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Since our fourth quarter call in mid-February, the environment has been dramatically challenged by a worldwide public health crisis. And before we begin, we wish to convey our sincere wishes for everyone's health and safety. We started the first quarter of 2020 ahead of expectations, reporting FFO per share of $1.22, $0.01 ahead of the high end of guidance. While everyone is focused on how the pandemic will affect our performance over the coming weeks and months, it's important to note that we entered the year from a position of strength and because of the underlying fundamentals of providing affordable housing and vacationing options; we expect to sustain a relative position of strength as we navigate through the pandemic. We began 2020 with total portfolio occupancy of 96.7% are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective, with approximately $380 million of unrestricted cash as of quarter end and a trailing net debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.6x. We want to commend and recognize our team and acknowledge the incredible job they have done stepping up and responding during this challenging time. Our team acted swiftly to ensure that Sun was doing its part to stem the spread of Coronavirus by adopting work from home practices at our main office and wherever possible at our communities. At our properties, we close the amenities where residents and guests gather and implemented recommended sanitation and hygiene protocols, while prioritizing health and safety by adhering to social distancing parameters, we're striving to provide Sun's trademark customer service. Given current shelter in place and social distancing orders, we do not know nor are we in control of the duration of the current changes in operating conditions brought on by the pandemic. However, we can adjust certain controllable operating expenses, modify our capital deployment plans and manage our liquidity. On the expense side, since Directors and Executive Officers have set the tone by electing to forego their compensation for at least the second quarter. The balance of our main office team members have also taken salary reductions and recognizing that we are all in this together. Additionally, we have placed a number of our team members on furlough, due to the closing of our amenities in the temporary reduction of transactions. The company will continue to pay both its share and the team member share of costs associated with providing each furloughed team members, uninterrupted healthcare benefits. We have implemented a rent forbearance program for residents financially impacted by the virus. We have elected to apply and provide the necessary information related to their hardship in order to qualify for the program. Approximately 2.9% of our manufactured housing residence, inclusive of our rental home program have applied and been approved. Requests from our annual RV guests have been minimal. In our manufactured housing portfolio, we have collected 98% of our rents as of April 22, which is on par with last month and prior year. In our RV portfolio, approximately 55% of our RV sites are leased annual sites. For annual RV rents currently due collections are at 92% relative to the percent collected at the same time last year. Of the remaining 45% of RV sites, which are transient, we're experiencing an impact from a pandemic with delayed resort openings and cancelled reservations. John will provide additional detail. Given limited visibility and the return to normal operating conditions and the duration of the current situation, we're suspending our 2020 financial and operating guidance. We've also determined it prudent to temporarily reduce or suspend certain capital spend and expansions in ground up developments and we continue to evaluate acquisitions with measured caution. John and Karen will provide further details on the unavoidable financial impact associated with the pandemic. However, we believe that even in the times of uncertainty or disruption, Sun's portfolio and the industry in which we operate, are well suited to withstand the impacts of a recession. Sun provides a high quality affordable housing option that has historically demonstrated stability and resilience during a downturn and a stronger earlier bounce back to recovery as the macro economy improved or different circumstances caused the great financial crisis in 2008. The underlying business model at Sun and the demand for affordable housing which Sun provides resulted in significant growth in the five years after the GFC. We anticipate that our RV Resort business will demonstrate a similar pattern, as it provides similar affordability in a market with proven strong demand and limited supply. Our RV Resorts provide an affordable vacation option where guests can travel an average of two to three hours safely in their own vehicles without the need to get on a plane, stay in a hotel or congregate in a public space. For now, the pandemic has galvanized our operations team to stay ahead of the situation and steer us in the right direction. They need daily to ensure that residents, guests and Sun team members are receiving compassion and unparalleled service during these times. They monitor local shelter in place mandates and are literally writing the playbook on how to navigate this fluid situation. There is no precedent for what the world or the Sun is experiencing. We've had to make some extremely difficult but necessary decisions to ensure that Sun continues to be the nation's premier, owner operator of manufacturer housing in RV communities. John and Karen will now provide additional operational and financial updates. John? It's Gary. I think that we want to be cautious. We have been in touch with the counties, cities and municipalities who have asked us to extend our openings from generally April 1, with the anticipation that they would be opening up and sometime in May. We haven't heard otherwise. So, as of right now, we do expect to get them all opened in the month of May. But that's of course going to be dependent on any change that we hear from the municipalities. Yes. I think we -- all sort of feel the same way. We can't brush aside or make light of the financial impact, especially the transient RV from the current pandemic, but we really have to look through to the value of the fundamental business proposition and the platform itself, which is, John sort of indicated we're providing an affordable and cost effective vacation experience in what really is a safe, self-contained RV and we're doing it to all various demographics. So we would expect really on the other side of this unfortunate circumstance that people that are looking for unique and desirable experience like RV offers to both individuals, retirees and families, spending time in our rustic camping resorts or one of our high-end glamping experience really should be in high demand. Anecdotally, I've heard from a least a dozen people over the last two weeks or so, looking to inquire and where to get an RV, of course, if we don't can get them a discount, if we can assist them. But as recent as yesterday, one of our Board Members wanted to let me know that they bought an RV. They've actually left Michigan and they are on their way first to Colorado traveling out to California. So we really feel that the RV business could benefit strongly from this unfortunate situation. And I think we'll see that rather rapidly when the impact of stay at home and travel bans are lifted. It's Gary. John's remarks did reflect what's taking place in the U.S. With regard to Ingenious and Australia, it's a little bit of a different business proposition. They've been a little bit less impacted. I'd like to thank maybe that social distancing of the size of the country versus the population allows them a little bit more natural barrier to what we're experiencing here in the U.S. But demand has remained strong, there's been -- as John said, tendency for people who maybe were going to move out of Sun's Communities to kind of postpone those moves and in the sort of opposite way in Australia, they queue up what they refer to as their settlements or the home closings long and advanced. And that's dictated by a residence, home sale, primary home sale, if they're downsizing, they look to downsize to relief equity to be used in their retirement. So it's very, very important to them to understand and know that as they sell their home, they have a place to go. So if anything, there's been a little bit of an acceleration and those who have reservations and plan to move into the Ingenious communities. So that's been a positive thing there. I would say that's somewhere in between there. But it hasn't been good before. It hasn't gotten any better. It hasn't gotten any worse. I think that we actually have a subcommittee on our Board of Directors that is really focused on improving the availability of home financing. They were on track to be able to work through probably the first manufacturer housing, loan securitization at the end of second quarter. I know John's worked very hard on it. Do we have any more color at this time? Yes. So we will keep everybody posted, but the home financing today is pretty much the same as it was two months ago. The rank collections by quarter, does someone have those available or rent increases renewals? I think it's something that we talked about and something that we're just going -- have to watch and continue to see what does take place just like across the country. But we have been conservative in our thought process through the quarter slowly ramping up as we indicated earlier, we have deferred rental increases for the time being. We have eliminated all fees related delay charges, various other fees that we often do collect and try to be there for our residents. As john said, our residents are there long-term and so it'll just be a work in process. If things continue on, we're going to have to be able to provide additional transparency to you and to the market. But we do think that we really did take a very good hard look at our best estimates. And that's what we put forward with the concept of what we know now. Thanks. So if they were to start making their first rental payment in June, we didn't want to burden them with the forbearance pay back, so that's why we delayed an additional 30 days. And that's also why we took the route of 12 equal payments to extend it over the longest period of time to make it easiest on the residents. We don't really have numbers and... We were very pleased proactively, our Board of Directors reached out to us very early on in the situation and wanted to do whatever they could and obviously, from a distance and strategically they've done some, but they continue to do some, but they were able to contribute financially in this way. That's excellent question. I would state the following that we have seen significant interest in three different areas. We're seeing several types of communities that until recent events were not likely to be for sale. So that's been probably the biggest surprise, properties that were or have been for sale, but we're not priced appropriately. We're getting a lot of inbound traffic and entering in dialogue and discussions as to whether or not those are things we want to look at right now. And then properties that could have been acquired, but we didn't act on or we weren't proactive to getting to them. They're starting to surface. So I think the overall responses that we are seeing kind of a turned up interest in acquisition offerings. And as I said in my earlier remarks, we're taking a very cautious approach to those acquisitions. But I think that for the time being, we're seeing a more realistic approach to how sellers might be thinking about their valuations. Yes. Anyways, we've talked about this. I think their metrics specifically tied to our portfolio. Sitting in March along with the rest of the world, we had no idea how our residents or when our residents would be paying April rent. We've gotten through April rent, really pleasantly pleased. We've now got a look at May assuming that we see continued strength with our residents and the desire to stay in the communities. We'll take it one month at a time. And I think it will be a combination of what we see in the macro world as well as how we feel about the quality of what we're offering against other opportunities and being compassionate to our residents who have stuck by us and we want to continue sticking by us. So it's a fluid situation and something John and the ops team will have to present to management here and making a full decision as we step forward really month by month. And the first thing we'd like to accomplish, as we shared with everybody is to get our transients seasonal -- our transient business back in our seasonal communities open. I think having that step behind us will be a positive thing and how we approach when or if we put in rental increases. I don't think the concept of refunding has been anything that we are expecting. And I think that if anything, we're to approach that magnitude or discussion. So, it's not something we've been actually kind of planning at this time."

            "content": "Thank you, Gary. I'll start with a recap on the strong performance and metrics in the first quarter, after which I'll provide specific details regarding the impact of the pandemic on operations, financials and the actions we've taken. As Gary mentioned, we're tracking strongly ahead of expectations for the quarter and delivered excellent same community growth, even after absorbing disruptions from the onset of shelter in place ordinances in mid to late March. Our total portfolio ended the first quarter 96.7% occupied, improving 30 basis points over last year and we added 300 revenue producing sites, even as shelter in place restrictions were put into effect. Our same community NOI increased 6.7% year-over-year, driven by 5.2% increase in same community revenues and a 1.8% increase in same community expenses. Same community manufactured housing revenue growth was 6.2%; annual RV revenues grew by 9.6%; and transient RV revenues decreased by 6% as we felt the first effects of COVID-19 related social distancing orders in March. In the first quarter, we saw same community occupancy increase to 98.4% from 96.6% in the first quarter of 2019. Even as social distancing began to impact traffic at our properties, home sales are quite strong with sales of 763 homes of which 119 were new homes and 234 rental home conversions. A core strength to Sun's operations team is the continual emphasis on refining our contingency planning and emergency preparedness and disaster recovery protocols, which are in place to rapidly deal with various out of the ordinary circumstances. By late February, the team began deploying recommended protocols throughout the portfolio and assessing how best the balance compliance with health related orders and the delivery of essential services to our residents and guests, which dictated a number of changes in the field. The steps we implemented are aimed to help ensure the safety of our residents, guests and team members assist our residents who are facing extreme financial challenges and to support our local communities wherever we can. In terms of health and safety, we seamlessly implemented work from home for all positions that can be remote. We enhanced our cleaning protocols, closed public amenities and discontinued social gatherings. Our onsite offices remain available for essential services. We have also stepped up our communications and virtual servicing options for current and prospective residents. We have adopted a financial hardship program to provide forbearance under certain terms to residents impacted financially by the pandemic and temporarily suspend evictions, late fees and rental rate increase. For residents to qualify for the financial hardship program, rent will be deferred through May and be payable in 12 equal installments beginning in July 2020. We estimate the deferred rent equates to $1.9 million for each of the two months and it includes resident owned homes on sites and our manufactured housing rental units. Now I'll provide some details related to the current quarter that will help frame our best estimate of financial expectations with regard to the actions just described and the impact of the pandemic. We are very pleased with the [indiscernible] rent collections, in our manufactured housing portfolio as Gary indicated earlier, we have collected 90% of our April rent today. While we're experiencing lower traffic at the communities as would be expected with shelter in place mandates, we're still seeing demand for movements and actually expect fewer move outs during this time. For the month of April, while total application count is down approximately 13% on a year-over-year basis, web applications are up 111% and represent 45% total applications compared to only 19% April the prior year. Our technology platform has the capability to capture online applications and steer prospective residents use Sun's web services. Our platform also has the capabilities to provide remote virtual home showings and tours allowing us to nimbly adapt in the face of this evolving landscape. Now we would like to provide some perspective in our RV portfolio. Our portfolio consists of over 26,000 annual sites and approximately 22,000 transient sites. The annual RV sites are located in resorts that are open year round, as well as resorts that are open on a seasonal basis. The majority of our annual sites are either Park models or sites where RVs are tied down and the guests has made significant investments in personalizing their sites by building decks, indoor outdoor rooms, and porches and installing landscaping and hardscaping essentially making these very permanent nature. These guests return year-after-year so what is typically their vacation home. On the transient side of our RV business, it has been our experience for more than 25 years, the most of Sun's transient RV guests enjoy the convenience and safety of driving in their own vehicle to a vacation destination they're familiar with and comfortable at. Based on many years of operating experience and engagement with our transient guests, we believe they are likely to return to our resorts when shelter in place and non-essential travel restrictions are lifted. Historically, over 50% of our transient RV guests returns the same resort each year, providing a predictable and steady income stream. For the time being, however, we have received an increased number of reservation cancellations related to shelter in place directly. Additionally, we have 44 RV resorts that would have been open on around April 1, but are being prohibited from opening by local authorities. As of now, we expect these resorts to open at various points in May as restrictions are lifted. Thus far for May and June, guests are calling frequently inquiring about our opening date and taking a wait and see approach with regard to their planned vacations. Forecasting for what we know related to cancellations bookings, resorts that are not currently open in effect that Memorial Day weekend is included in this quarter. Our best estimate for the second quarter includes a reduction of $10 million transient revenue from our original budget expectations. In addition to this forecasted reduction in transient RV revenue just discussed based on the current environment, there are a number of additional revenue sources that could be impacted temporarily. These include lower manufactured housing revenue due to rental increases being deferred and lower occupancy gains. Lower annual RV revenue related to fewer transients annual site conversions and the associated rent pickup. Lower other and ancillary income due to various fees not being collected as a result of delayed resort openings, and lower home sales and brokerage fees as a result of stay at home orders and travel restrictions. Despite the near-term disruption to our operations, we are confident in the long-term viability of our mission and business model, which has stood the test of time throughout many of the most difficult economic times and downturns over the life of the industry. During those periods, this industry has been characterized by its steady, predictable cash flow, fueled by strong consumer demand for homeownership, as well as the demand for affordable vacationing. I would now like to turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial results, balance sheet and provide a summary of the potential impact to our second quarter as a result of the pandemic. Karen? Hey, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, it's, I mean, that is going to be sort of aligned with the government mandates and as things start to lift along the way, I think we said in our prepared remarks. So we expect that sort of start happening in May. And I think one of the important things with that, John, is the fact that we often talk about our playbook, and the decades we're finding that playbook and all of this situation is just a different version of operating conditions during post natural disasters and hurricanes and things like that, that we deal with. So, as you might imagine, pretty much as soon as this all started to happen, we were preparing our plants for reopening at the same time. And through that, we've developed the three phased plan associated with reopening that will align with those government mandates that all you really have to do is drop in the open date, and it guides to prepare our team leading to opening all the way through normal operations status. And so the plan itself includes proper sequencing of reopening the resorts and the amenities, starting with ones that provide better space or social distancing. So we're really looking forward to welcoming our guests back. But again, that's going to be more along the lines of whatever the governmental authorities allow us to do. Well, one of the interesting things about an RV Resort as opposed to other hospitality options is there's sort of some of that built-in spread, because everybody has their own site that they're on, which promotes all by itself, social distancing. Some of the things that we've done -- some examples of some things, John, that we've already put into play to get ahead of that is, we've actually already stocked social distancing signage for all entry points. So we have what's in our communities, as well as you've seen those before conferences where they put the stickers down on the floors. And we can do that in the more highly trafficked areas to promote that as well. And I think one of the really key things that we're able to do is utilize our Online Express checking capabilities, which allows guests to check in and pay early allowing them for a touchless arrival process as well. So, there's a lot of that sort of thing that's happening. But I think by its very nature and RV Resort promotes a lot of social distancing, right out of the gate. And I also think that, Gary and I both agree that many people are going to want to get out of their houses. Yes. Nick, this is John. I think the way I'd characterize is that with April rent collections that they all age portfolio is showed its resilience. And I think it also benefits along with the rest of the portfolio, sort of the proactive nature of our culture. One of the things that we've said as a company for a decade or longer has been the best revenue producing site you can gain as the one you never lose. And I think everybody knows that. Our average residency in our communities is 14 years, there's a value proposition, there's a reason why people want to be there. From a rent collection standpoint in April, rent collections for all age communities is on par with last month. I mean, and so I think that that really kind of shows coming right into this, when there was a lot of uncertainty coming into this pandemic that that value proposition that people see is realized. The other thing I'd add is a component of the all age portfolio is a bit of a reminder that, that we've shared before that, from a retiree standpoint, or when you compare 55 plus versus all age not every person who is over 55 wants to live in a retirement community. So we have a healthy component of residents within our all age communities that are retirees. And so those folks are going to be less impacted by things like job loss than others. And so, I think looking out -- looking into May, I would add that, I think that our hardship program did what it was designed to do and that takes the pressure off as well. And I would like to think that some of the things that our government has done to help promote what people's needs are with the stimulus plan and the checks that are starting to arrive that I would hope that the experience from May rent collection will be similar to that of April. No, I mean, it's really, it's pretty much, it's about 50:50 as far as the utilization of the hardship program. So it was -- it's very similar in nature. I will tell you that an interesting thing that's happened during this terrible crisis has been that with the rental home program our applications in April are actually up versus where they were April of last year. Well, speaking to the U.S., really, I think one of the things on our expansion development spend has been the fact that and I think we might have shared this before as well, I apologize for my repeating myself. But we're fortunate that we're always in a position thinking ahead and stay in a year, year and a half ahead of what the supply needs are for expansion sites. As we shared another cause we had 2100 sites built in '17, 1200 sites in '18, 1200 in 2019. And so we've got a good supply of site. So tapering it down for a bit, really shouldn't have an impact. Yes. I mean sort of the natural sequence Drew with many openings is going to start with ones that are more social distancing promoting, so call it more of the outdoor type stuff that we have out there where there can be less contact. I think some of the things that we're doing in terms of signage, one of the things that we're also doing, we're starting to secure a supply of infrared thermometers, where we can check temperatures as our team comes in for the day and as well as when our guests check in and those sorts of things. And we're actually going to be providing wristbands everybody indicated they've been cleared. Just out of an abundance of caution that we do this and help them to build confidence for our guests coming back because they're excited to come back and they want to be there. And so, that's sort of the sequencing of it. We've not to-date made any adjustments in terms of rate. Yes. As far as the expansion site delivers, again, I don't think that there's a lot of impact from an availability or supply standpoint. I mean, it really is, from an application standpoint, as we've shared in the remarks, the apps are down only 13% thus far. We've got excellent web-based connectivity to be able to continue to collect applications and as well as do virtual showings and that sort of thing. And frankly, I've seen a lot of great creativity out of our teams out in the field. And so, again, it's going to line up more without being able to tell you exactly what's going to happen. It's all going to line up with no kind of as these things start to ease up a little bit, but in the end, we are still building a pipeline that we will remain engaged with those prospects and customers that when the time comes and we can sort of be it in pace we are used to be in at, then it's all really about the throughput that we do after that. 98. No. No, I haven't. Not at this time. Well, that's a good question, because that's precisely why we designed the program to include April and May because the thought process was with a hardship program and it was going to be very difficult for people to go out and find jobs in April. And so, we wanted to kind of wrap it over both of those months. And as we talked about in our prepared remarks, begin the payments, lighter payments starting over a 12-month period of time in July. So I think that provides a lot of support for our residents. My hope would be that that will one promote, like I said earlier on this call, good May rent collections as well as put some things at ease for people, as they're kind of putting things back together when the pandemic starts to hopefully taper down. It's a pretty wide range. I mean, it can be anywhere from a year in advance and a lot of people that are booking before they even leave the resort from the year before it could be the day of. Yes. So the increases that are out there about 50% is what happens in the first quarter. And so those are already out Josh. And then, we have put a hole on further rent increases until things start to open up or ease up a little bit. And so I think, when you look at this sort of overall, it could have about maybe a 50 basis point impact on the guided rent increase for 2020. That's our best estimate at this point in time. It's both. Yes. So sort of like what Gary said just a minute ago. I mean, I think that we launched the program even before April rent was due trying to think of ahead of it. So we are thinking about that, but the thought process was to just cover April and May based on the data that we had at the time, that's out there to try and set up the program, so it sort of fits with the various models that are out there. And to provide some space between when things hopefully start to slow down, when people have to start making payments back. And so I would say as far as June is concerned and tied, I mean, it's something that we will closely monitor as things evolve or emerge as we need to. Absolutely right. I think it's also Nick important to note that the vast majority of the seasonal or the annual site and the seasonal resorts, those sites remain occupied 12 months of the year. Like we shared in the script where it's either a park model or it's a tied down unit where they've done significant investment in their sites. And so similar to MH, it's a very significant investment that's been made by them. So I think that a lot of -- frankly, they expect to pay the rent."

A question-and-answer session will begin after the formal presentation. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and provide and overview of our 2022 guidance. The accelerated growth we delivered this past year is a testament to the resilience, desirability and favorable positioning of our best-in-class portfolio. As the largest owner and operator of manufactured housing communities, RV resorts and marinas, we are uniquely positioned to meet customer needs across all of our platforms. The ongoing demand for attainable housing and outdoor vacationing and leisure activities has continued tailwinds for some. With this backdrop, we’ve delivered industry-leading and sustained earnings growth, as well as meaningful value creation with our strategic acquisitions. For the year, core FFO per share increased nearly 28% and same community NOI grew 11.2% over 2020, building further on the growth we delivered throughout the pandemic, driven by high occupancy and rent increases. We added approximately 2,500 revenue-producing sites and total home sales increased nearly 43% as compared to the prior year, demonstrating the high demand to live in a Sun community. On the external growth front, during 2021 and through the date of this call, we acquired approximately $1.5 billion of properties and invested approximately $173 million in land for development to build out in the coming years. In the fourth quarter, we realized yet another milestone achievement, with the announced pending acquisition of Park Holidays for approximately $1.3 billion, which is anticipated to close mid-March. Park Holidays is the second largest owner and operator of holiday parks in the UK, with 40 owned and two managed communities. Their business model is nearly identical to that Sun’s manufactured housing platform. And this transaction allows us to apply a proven expertise and track record to a fragmented market, further expanding our opportunities and accelerating our growth potential. For the RV business, many travelers continue to discover the enjoyment and affordability of an RV vacation. The ongoing demand and interest in the RV lifestyle at Sun Outdoors is evident with accelerated same community RV revenue growth of nearly 25% compared to 2020. And compared to 2019, the same community RV NOI CAGR increased by 12%. We believe tailwinds support continued demand and a shift in consumer behavior with a strong desire to experience the great outdoors. RV sales continue to increase in volume, with RV shipments surpassing 600,000 for 2021, an all-time high for the industry. We are also pleased with the growth we are capturing in the marina business. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, both sales in 2021 surpassed 300,000 units for the second consecutive year, indicating continued demand. Through the end of 2021 starting with the acquisition of Safe Harbor in October of 2020, we have added 125 marinas to our portfolio, including 19 in 2021, and we maintain an active pipeline that will continue to feed our growth and shareholder returns. The longstanding relationships with Safe Harbor team has in the marina industry, the ability to transact with tax deferred securities, and Sun’s attractive cost of capital have made Safe Harbor the premier marina consolidator. At the foundation of this growth and success, our Sun’s core attributes, which encompass our commitment to our team members, including empowerment and accountability, leadership and governance as well as sustainability. We are pleased to have greatly enhanced our ESG disclosures and established a baseline from which to demonstrate improvements. We recently published our Annual ESG Report, and we responded to three voluntary frameworks in 2021. This year, Sun will continue to submit responses to these frameworks, improve in areas of identified opportunity, integrate green building practices into our new developments and incorporate the marina platform into our ESG reporting process. With confidence in Sun’s continued ability to generate industry-leading results, our Board has raised our 2022 distributions of $3.52 per share, up 6% from last year. 2021 was another year of outsized growth for Sun as we continue to expand through acquisitions, expansions, and new MH and RV community developments in addition to consolidating the marina sector. Our unparalleled focus on delivering the best customer experience and optimizing our operating platform is evident in our track record. We’re proud of this track record and recognize that we need to continue to invest in our platform, technology and innovation to deliver industry-leading growth for years to come. Supported by a favorable macro environment, we are confident that Sun has uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity as we execute on our strategic priorities. We are grateful for our dedicated team members’ daily commitment as we enhance our offerings and deliver growth with continued best-in-class customer service across the entire Sun platform for our residents, guests, members and all shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John and Karen to discuss our results and guidance in further detail.\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. Sun delivered yet another year of strong results in 2021. Our operational strength across the entire platform is a testament to our unrivaled team managing a best-in-class portfolio. In the fourth quarter, same community NOI increased by 8.4% compared to the same period in 2020. It was driven by an 8.5% increase in revenues, reflecting a 3.6% increase in weighted average monthly rent, a 140 basis point occupancy gain and 15% growth in transient RV revenues. To further provide detail, manufactured housing same community NOI increased by 6.7% and the RV segment same community NOI grew by 14.1%. For the full year, same community NOI increased by 11.2% over the prior year. The NOI increase was mainly due to an 11.8% increase in revenues, offset by a 13.1% increase in expenses. The expense growth was mainly driven by our RV same community in line with increased transient RV revenues. Same community MH revenues increased by 5.7% and RV revenues grew by 24.8% with contributions from occupancy and rate increases. Our $1.4 billion of operating property acquisitions for the year included 11 manufactured housing communities, 24 RV resorts and 19 marinas with over 15,800 sites wet slips and dry storage spaces. Year-to-date, in 2022, we have closed on two marinas and one bolt-on for approximately $62 million. We are seeing sustained demand for attainable housing affordable vacationing. The applications to live in a Sun community averaged approximately 50,000 applications per year for the last five years, including over 55,000 applications in 2021. Home sales increased by 28.4% for new homes and 46.2% for pre-owned homes as compared to 2020. Brokered home sales increased by 38% for the year, with an average sales price of 27%. We gained nearly 2,500 revenue-producing sites during the year, with almost 1,700 coming from RV transient, the annual conversions a record high for Sun. With each conversion of transient site to annual lease, we gain an average of 50% revenue uplift within the first year. Total portfolio occupancy as of December 31, 2021 was 97.4%, which provides us with the potential for continued occupancy gains as we fill up vacant sites. In addition, we have an attractive growth pipeline as we continue building new sites in our expansion communities and ground-up developments. To that end, Sun delivered over 1,600 expansion in ground-up development sites at 19 properties in 2021. These include two newly opened manufactured housing communities with a total build out of nearly 600 sites. Our pipeline of land for future expansion in greenfield development continues to grow with the acquisition of approximately $173 million in land for future development, where there is strong demand for attainable housing and vacationing. During 2022, we expect to begin construction of five new greenfield MH communities, which when fully built out, will add approximately 1,500 new MH sites to Sun’s portfolio. Over the past five-plus years, we’ve been building our development platform in order to build new modern MH communities for better returns than the cost of acquiring existing MH communities in these locations. We believe this work and investment will provide Sun with a significant competitive advantage as we look to grow our MH portfolio over the next one to five years. As of year-end, we had nearly 11,000 zone and titled sites available for expansion in new development. Forward bookings to our Sun owned and operate RV resorts are pacing 62% ahead of last year for the first quarter and 53% ahead of the first half of the year. This pacing year-over-year provides us with confidence that demand for RV vacation and lifestyle remains strong and we are further investing in this segment to reinforce our leading position and drive ongoing demand in Sun resorts. In 2022, this investment includes an RV rebranding and supporting media campaign as we launch our new branding for our RV resorts, Sun Outdoors. For example, at the end of November, we launched our Sun Outdoors YouTube channel, and are producing a number of videos series featuring various vacation options at our RV resorts. Additionally, our proprietary Sun Outdoors’ mobile app was released live this past quarter. The app offers an image rich streamlined booking experience for our branded Sun Outdoors and sun retreat destinations. Our social media strategy continues to be the top tier performer in the outdoor lifestyle industry as guests explore their Sun of your side. Within our Marina business, we acquired 19 new marina properties in 2021, including five in the fourth quarter. Same marina rental revenue growth for properties owned and managed by Safe Harbor since 2019 was 17.8% for the full year 2021 over 2019, which is a CAGR increase of rental revenue of 7.4% for the quarter and 8.5% for the year. The main drivers of the revenue increase this quarter was strong wet and dry storage revenues, resulting from rate and occupancy increases across the portfolio. During 2021, we consistently execute on our four core investment strategies. First, reinvesting in our existing communities leads to steady demand and high occupancy to live in Sun’s properties; second, the acquisition of accretive properties continues to add revenue and cash flow; third, expansion in our existing properties provides occupancy revenue growth and high demand, low supply markets; and fourth, ground-up developments provide Sun with the ability to build the highest quality communities for our residents and guests while achieving high returns for our shareholders. This year, with our continued reinvestment in our communities, acquisition of over 50 operating properties, delivery of over 1,600 development sites and opening the first phases of two manufactured housing and two RV redevelopments, Sun successfully executed on each of these four core strategic pillars. Going into 2022, we are successfully executing our core strategies and continue the momentum to yield industry-leading growth, which is [ph] and continue the momentum to yield industry-leading growth, which could not be possible without our entire Sun team. Karen will now discuss our financial results and guidance for 2022. Karen?\nKaren Dearing: Thanks, John. For the fourth quarter, Sun reported core FFO per share of $1.31, 12.9% above the prior year. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, core FFO per share was $6.51, which was $0.01 ahead of the top end of our 2021 revised guidance and an increase of 27.9% from 2020. During 2021 and through the date of this call, Sun acquired approximately $1.5 billion of operating properties and approximately $173 million in land for our development growth initiatives. To support this growth, Sun raised approximately $2.2 billion in equity and our operating partnership issued $1.2 billion in senior unsecured notes. This capital market activity provides us with continued capacity to pursue our growth initiatives and maintain a well-positioned balance sheet. Sun ended 2021 with $5.7 billion of debt outstanding at a 3% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 8.8 years. We had $65.8 million unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12 months recurring EBITDA ratio of 5.7 times. On a pro forma basis, including our fully loaded trailing 12-month EBITDA and our forward equity issuances, our net debt to EBITDA would be in the mid 4 times. With regard to our outlook for 2022, we expect core FFO to be in the range of $7.07 to $7.23 per share and for the first quarter of 2022, core FFO to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.27 per share. Our 2022 manufactured housing in RV same property NOI growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 6.8%, and our marina same property NOI growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 7.4%. The 2022 same property pools have 428 manufactured housing in RV properties and 101 marinas. We anticipate MH and annual RV revenue-producing site gains throughout the year to be between 2,500 to 2,800, with over 60% coming from transient RV conversions to annual leases and the balance of gains in our manufactured housing communities. On the development front, we plan to deliver between 1,600 to 2,000 vacant expansion and ground-up development sites in 2022. Our 2022 G&A expense is projected to be in the range of $231 million to $236 million. As Gary and John mentioned, we have a strong track record and industry-leading position and we are seeing favorable tailwind supporting continued momentum. To further optimize our position and maximize the growth opportunities, we are making a number of investments in our platform and our team members. In addition to the Sun Outdoors rebranding that John discussed, we are making strategic investments in our business, specifically in our technology and people resources to support a new enterprise resource planning or ERP system launching later this year as well as continuing to build the Safe Harbor infrastructure to support anticipated growth. Please refer to our supplemental information for additional disclosures on the assumptions used to prepare our 2022 guidance and expected seasonality within Sun’s portfolio, as actual future events may not coincide with the assumptions used to prepare the 2022 guidance. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call and the anticipated closing of Park Holidays in mid-March. It does not include the impact of other prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.\nKeegan Carl: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. First, on the manufactured housing rate increased guidance, can you just give us some more color plus the breakout between all age communities and age restricted?\nJohn McLaren: Keegan, this is John. Actually, I don’t have that breakout between all age and 55-plus. We can certainly get back to you on that.\nKeegan Carl: Okay. So switching gears a bit to marinas, so we’ve now seen a full year performance just kind of big picture, you reflect on the business a bit and kind of what surprised you since you’ve gotten the space?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah, I can take. This is Gary. And I think that I would characterize it as not much in the category of surprises, but very pleased in the performance as expected and underwritten. Again, I think what’s Sun’s core strength is identifying business platforms that have strong demand and low supply with high barriers to entry when we think of MH and RV and discussed how marinas is very, very similar to that. It’s performed in a manner that we underwrote to and so we continue to see a demand fact that Safe Harbor has been a leader in the marina network, its membership continues to grow, occupancies remain high, rental increases are rock solid. So pretty much what we were looking for and the opportunity to continue to consolidate the industry as fragmented as it is, is very exciting. And the pipeline in the marina area allows us to be very, very strategic in our thinking over at Safe Harbor, as the acquisitions team is able to really choose and be very, very selective on acquiring properties that will meet the travel patterns of the membership, as well as create the highest opportunity for growth. So pretty much what we had hoped for. And so we’re pleasantly pleased as opposed to surprise.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And just to follow-up on the marina pipeline. Is it fair to assume in 2022, the vast majority of your external growth is going to be tilted towards marinas and then Holiday Parks?\nGary Shiffman: No, the question always comes up about capital allocation. And we’ve always shared the fact that we will continue to deploy capital across all three business lines, and it’s our relationships in all lines, including manufactured housing that have allowed us to continue to acquire, I think, what we are finding, there is further compression in the cap rates and on the MH and RV side. So where we can get great growth, we will look to deploy capital. So that includes marinas and includes the growth of Park Holidays in the UK as we view it as the stickiest type of revenue, because it is basically our manufactured housing community model. So I think those are two areas we will continue to focus on. The third is John just said in his remarks relates to the capital that we’ve been investing and continue to invest to grow our MH platform through greenfield development. So this coming year, John said, we’re expecting to open up or start construction on five new manufactured housing communities. We’d like to see that be a minimum of five new communities per year at least. And therefore, there’ll be a lot of capital allocation to that new development of manufactured housing communities here in the U.S.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Your core FFO grew 28% in 2021. And on this tough comparison, you’re still expecting a really strong 7.5% to 11% – still expecting a really strong 7.5% to 11% in 2022 with minimal benefit from acquisition. So trying to get a better understand the growth rate. Can you kind of talk through the near-term puts and takes that get you to this range, so that we can get a better sense until like what the actual underlying for normalized FFO growth rate is once we kind of get a little bit past some of these tailwinds from the pandemic? Thank you.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Michael. This is Fernando. As you – I think the biggest indicator is going to be our same property growth, that’s always going to be the leader from delivering growth year-over-year. At the midpoint, our manufactured housing and RV platform is expected to grow by 6.4% NOI this year, and the marina platform at the midpoint again, is expected to grow by 6.7%. That’s always going to be the largest contributor. And then we have other levers to pull, like the acquisition of operating properties, the development and fill-up of our expansion properties in existing communities, as well as Gary just said, the hopeful acceleration of investment in our ground-up development projects, those are going to be the largest components that are going to deliver year-over-year growth.\nGary Shiffman: The only thing that I would remind everybody is that no future acquisitions. And I guess as Karen says, capital transactions are actually built into our 2022 growth. So to the extent that we continue with the type of pipeline we have now that would be additive to growth this coming year.\nMichael Goldsmith: All right. And on that point, does your G&A guidance include anything from the holiday parks’ UK business? Is it – this guided up to – G&A is up 27% to 30%?\nKaren Dearing: Yeah, G&A for Sun and Safe Harbor is the $231 million, I think, to $236 million. The Park Holidays acquisition, which is expected in mid-March and the additional I think it is around $29 million to $30.5 of G&A.\nMichael Goldsmith: That’s really helpful. And just one last one for me. Does your guidance include the additional June’s three-day holiday in mid-June in the guidance? And then you provided guidance for transient revenue, but do you have the growth rate for the same store pool?\nKaren Dearing: I think – could you ask that question again, to be sure that we understand that?\nMichael Goldsmith: Yeah, so does your guidance include the benefit from the additional three-day holiday in mid-June? And then also, you provided the guidance for the transient revenue growth overall, do you have that number but for the same store pool?\nJohn McLaren: Michael, our forecasts would include the additional three-day weekend in the middle of June. And we can get back to you on the expected revenue growth in our budget for transient.\nMichael Goldsmith: Great. Thank you so much. Good luck in 2022.\nGary Shiffman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on the marina guidance. You had 5.7% at the midpoint? Can you just discuss what’s driving this whether it’s rate versus documents increase versus the potential expansions and then you have F&B revenue?\nGary Shiffman: I just want to clarify John, 6.7% at the midpoint, not 5.7% is what Fernando shared. I think generally, from rate and continued scale, occupancy remains very strong. And similar, although we did grow by almost 60% in size in the marina platform in the last 16, 17 months. So enormous growth there, and it’s just pretty much continued operations where we have demand that just far exceeds the steps in the strategic locations that we have. So it’s rental rate growth. Along with that, there is a component of ancillary incomes and that’s not in the same community separate. So yeah, rental growth, little bit of increased occupancy and also CapEx revenue-generating investment too [ph] have strong returns.\nJohn Kim: Gotcha, Gary. Yeah, Slide 7 is referring to 6.7% [ph] in NOI.\nGary Shiffman: Okay, sorry.\nJohn Kim: But that brings me to my second question, on your guidance for MH, RV, your expense growth is exceeding revenue growth. And I know there’s some recent acquisitions that you’re looking to spend on. But how much of that increased expense is due to higher transient RV revenue and the variable expense that comes along with that?\nKaren Dearing: It’s like that – so you’re referring to the 7.5% at the midpoint of growth and expenses, John. So really, with the – that is made up 50% of that. The increase is made up of three things. The first is really that proactive wage increase that we discussed last year, and we said be partially impacting 2021. And the other piece impacts the first half of 2022. And that’s about an $8 million impact on salaries and wages. In the first half of the year, the other two items are real estate tax assessments. Florida and Texas in expansion and development properties are seeing increased real estate tax assessments. And the other piece of it is really are the advertising spend. So those are the things that are increasing the expense growth. If you removed the $8 million from the wage and salary increases, our expense growth would be just a little above 5%.\nJohn Kim: And Karen, you discussed the higher G&A, if it’s like a 30% increase this year, and some of that is due to investments you’re making in the platform, but how much of that increase is due to Park Holidays and Safe Harbor?\nKaren Dearing: So Park Holidays is not in the $231 million to $236 million increase. That’s a separate bucket. G&A is really a reflection of the investments we’re making to continue to deliver our outsized growth. We have a great track record on executing on our strategies and we have strong tailwind. So we are net year-over-year growth. It’s really made up of continuing to build Safe Harbor, their infrastructure as they’ve increased their size, as Gary said, a little over 60% in the last 15 months and they’ll continue to consolidate that market. So pieces Safe Harbor, quarter of it is. Another quarter is related to the RV rebranding that John discussed, and the remaining half of the G&A increase is investments in our overall platform, including a new ERP system, which will be coming on board later this year. Wages and deferred stock compensation, we need to continue to build our best-in-class team and retain our best-in-class team. And then we have some other costs associated with strategic initiative with ESG reporting, the EI initiatives, data analytics, and also some costs related to ensure the success of the UK investment. So that’s really the drivers for the G&A increase.\nJohn Kim: Is it fair to assume that some of those are one-time and the G&A increase will or the growth of that will decelerate in 2023?\nKaren Dearing: Yeah, yeah.\nJohn Kim: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. Maybe just following up on that, what are the opportunities for either back office or G&A synergies for Park Holidays and Safe Harbor across the Sun broader platform?\nGary Shiffman: I think like I’ll share with you the following. When I talk about Sun’s really strength and ability to identify platforms that have high demand, low supply, high barriers to entry. Each one of these that we enter into require a very thoughtful, detailed underwriting. And as we share with a market on our transformed of transactions over the last 10 years, let’s just say, we look to gain scale and do gain accretion above the core portfolio in a one to two-year period of time after integrating the transformative transaction. So our expectation would be that we would begin to scale and seeing increased leveraged results in our earnings sometime throughout the next year, the marina platform. And then when we look at Park Holidays, although John and I would share very, very similar to our manufactured housing business here, it is a foreign country with FX, with accounting and taxation and regulation. So as we approach it, I think what we do best is kind of crawl and walk before we run. So there is an effort on the G&A side to reflect a bit of insurance, so to speak, that we deliver the results that our stakeholders and shareholders are looking for. So again, in 12 to 24 months out after the closing, we would love to be able to scale and see further reductions in growth of the G&A. I think that we’ve seen large growth in year-over-year G&A for the last couple of years, I think that’s going to pay strong dividends. And we’re going to be able to post strong growth as we go forward. But certainly, Park Holidays and our entrance into the UK is causing us to be very, very cautious and conservative with how we begin to undertake operating in the UK.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. Then you mentioned the transformative transactions over the last few years Safe Harbor, Park Holidays, even I guess with Australia, is there anything in the current acquisition pipeline that’s outside of either the kind of historical or even in the new verticals?\nGary Shiffman: No, I’d say we’re very, very focused on staying within the platforms that we have, but we’re extraordinarily excited to be able to ramp up the MH land lease type of community, both in Australia revenue – in Australia with our JV with Ingenia, as well as Park Holidays and growing that platform, very, very sticky revenue again, as been indicated by history. The Park Holidays platform we think of as very similar to our snowbird manufactured housing communities in Florida and Arizona and elsewhere, where these are second home owners. They must own a primary home by law in order to qualify for buying a home in the holiday parks. So the seasonality that you see as well as created by that pretty much coincides with the school year in the UK. So we will focus on taking the opportunity to consolidate a very fragmented industry in the UK, just as we’ve done in the marinas, and then in the U.S., we’ll continue growing our MH and RV platform. And as we talked about before, dive deeper into the new manufactured housing community development. So we really got a great strategic plan going forward. And I don’t see anything in the pipeline that would change from that.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey, good morning, everyone. Karen maybe just a follow-up on the Australian JV. That’s kind of the latest on that. I’m curious if you’re able to kind of ramp up on building that out.\nGary Shiffman: So I’m going to turn that over to John. He stepped into the designated board position some time ago, and really the best one to address that.\nJohn McLaren: Hey, Josh, how you doing? As we’ve – as we shared before, I think everybody know that Australians had a pretty strict response with respect to COVID. So there’s been some delays. But that said, our JV, Ingenia, we’ve actually acquired two additional untitled parcels in 2021. So we actually now have five new developments that are underway. One is actually – one is open and selling homes nicely, and we expect three of the remainders to start construction this year. So as we might have shared on other calls, it’s been, unfortunately, a couple of years since Gary or I have been able to go out, look forward to getting my feet back on the ground out there now that things opened up and you see in these three developments start to be built. So I think things are really going to accelerate.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Awesome. Appreciate that. And then appreciate the color on the seasonality of the Park Holidays EBITDA. I guess one, what drives that? And is there any kind of opportunity to maybe smooth it out and kind of expand what you – where you can achieve in 1Q and 4Q?\nJohn McLaren: Josh, the seasonality of Park Holidays is really, as Gary just mentioned, the seasons – the season there is really between April to October. We do recognize pitch fee income over the course of the 12 months. But the activity at the properties is really during the second and third quarter, just like you would expect from our Northern RV properties here in the U.S. and Canada.\nGary Shiffman: The only thing I’d add to that longer-term, as we grow out the platform and increase the communities, we see that we’ll be able to move the sales operation from new community to new communities. So as a percentage of the overall income, the sales will reduce. Therefore, the pitch fees will increase. And as they’re recognized on a monthly basis, I would expect three, five years out that there will be less seasonality because the monthly pitch fees will be a much greater percentage than the sales revenues today.\nJoshua Dennerlein: All right. Can you just clarify what the pitch fees are?\nGary Shiffman: It would be the monthly fees, we call it rent collected – site rent. They’re the equivalent of site rent in the UK vernacular.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Got it. Thank you.\nGary Shiffman: They have a more or less permanent home on them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nWesley Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. I’m hoping to get a little more context on the development that you’re doing. I believe you said you want to start five new MH communities. Can you give us a sense of what you think your share is of overall image development?\nJohn McLaren: Wes, this is John. I think it’s actually – I don’t know the exact percentage, but I’m sure it’s pretty big share, because we spent six years building this pipeline of development. And as we might have shared before, we’ve got over 10,000 sites in various stages of entitlement today, plus more that we’re looking at behind that. And so it’s – we do here about, I would say, probably more smaller RV development that’s taking place like people bolting on 30 sites, 20 sites, things like that to existing communities and there are some new ground-ups that have taken place. But I think on the MH side, I believe that we are sort of uniquely positioned in leading the industry in terms of what we’re developing, just because it does take as long as it takes to build that pipeline as we have for the last five, six years.\nWesley Golladay: And you also acquired in Jellystone or LSI this quarter. Can you talk about what your thought process is behind that for LSI this quarter? Can you talk about what your thought process is behind that investment?\nJohn McLaren: Yeah, for sure. The biggest pieces that we currently own 21 Jellystones in the portfolio today. So it was really a strategic acquisition, for us to enhance what we believe is a really important camping – family camping brand and put our know-how to it and merge it together. So that, frankly, we control the brand message, the reach and the guests experience is really important to us. So it’s more strategic in nature. And when you look at what’s taking place over the course of 2021, with having over 230,000 new guests to our resorts, the tailwinds that are happening, the booking pace that we’re seeing with 62% ahead of the first quarter of last year, and over 50% ahead of the first half of last year, adding on the launch of Sun Outdoors, our social strategy, the new website, mobile app, other platforms that are engaging idle RVs that are sitting in people’s backyards, to monetize that and get more rigs out onto the road. And so that inherent demand is increasing. That seemed like a very logical thing to do from a strategic nature to extend the brand that we have just launched with Sun Outdoors.\nWesley Golladay: I just have one follow-up on Park Holiday. You guided to the EBITDA, but can you tell us how much of the – is going to be derived from vacation home sales, and while that flow into FFO?\nJohn McLaren: I was – the split of gross profits which will mirror EBITDA contribution for 2022 and some of the high 30% from the sale of homes, the – and then the rest of it split. You’ve got about 30% coming from site fees with owners in – on those properties, about 20% the transient vacation rental stays and the balance in an F&B, retail, dining and entertainment.\nWesley Golladay: A real quick for an add on that one. For the 30%, that is home sales, would any of that be backed out FFO or they all be new home sales?\nJohn McLaren: There is a small amount of homes that are depreciated that would be backed out of FFO. But it’s, call it, about 15%, 20%.\nWesley Golladay: Got it. All right. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Question about the Sun Outdoors branding, I guess how do you look at the ROI of that initiative? And are you trying to drive more transient revenues, [indiscernible], curious how you think about that overall?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah, I think everything really drives towards the growth in annual leases within our communities. I mean, the starting point in the evolution of RV is people come out more on a short-term basis to stay the weekend, they might have a pop up. And they might start off as tent campers when they come in. And they sort of graduate through it all to hopefully meet come conversions of transient guests to annual leases, which, as we shared before, provides a 50% uplift in revenue in that first year. And so, the strategy behind it was one, we have an incredibly beautiful portfolio of properties that we’ve accumulated over the last 10 years is to layer a brand over it, okay, providing the highest quality resorts and unparalleled customer experience and satisfaction. And by organizing that into a set of properties of segmentation, which Sun Outdoors is going to be for more short-term stays, Sun treats for seasonal stays of the annuals I was talking about a minute ago, and then some resorts and residences for 55-plus communities. And so as you sort of align that up against what we have today, and the goal of converting people along the way and the success that we’ve had, like we had last year with over 1,700 conversions of short-term guests to long-term leases, and what we shared in our guidance, the bigger portion of our RPS gains are going to be associated with those conversions. And then add that to the pipeline of sites that we have that are opportunities for conversions. It all kind of flows together, which is sort of the business case for launching the brand being more organized around it and flowing our guests through those – through the lifecycle of a guest and RV resort.\nJohn McLaren: I think I would add, Anthony, the conversions that John talks about represent a first year uplift of about 50%, okay, first year uplift of about 50%, okay, in revenue. So when we talked about the returns, and we looked at all the returns on the investment, that is a big part of what is created there.\nAnthony Powell: Thanks for that. And in terms of guests that the holiday park model, do you think this could be brought to the U.S.? I imagine that it could be easier and theoretically to get new holiday parks entitled versus traditional MH in various parts of the country. So it could be opportunity for development longer-term, have you thought about that?\nGary Shiffman: Ironically, as I said before, it’s really a mirror image of what we do currently in our manufactured housing communities and especially the areas where the snowbirds come in. So they’re up in often their northern homes during the nice part of the year. And then they head down to their second home, their vacation home, down in Florida and Arizona and other places where we have. One of the things that we’re strategically looking at as we continue to look to expand our manufactured housing community portfolio, is the concept of more vacations, second homes. And so we’re looking in areas where people want to vacation, or they want to be outdoors close to their outdoor habits of skiing or biking and hiking and things like that. So coincidentally, very similar to the Park Holidays model that exists, which is mostly coastal within a two, three-hour ride of London and most heavily populated areas in the UK. So something we were already looking at and something that intrigued us when we saw that that model already existed in the UK. So it’s kind of a bit of a coincidence that we identified the opportunity and have an opportunity to take a fragmented and consolidated vacation, second home opportunity in the UK, and kind of a season. At the same time, we are currently trying to build that model in the U.S. So I’m sure there’ll be a lot of transatlantic learning, so to speak, back and forth. So it is a good point.\nJohn McLaren: And right in our wheelhouse.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Maybe one for me on cap rates. You mentioned cap rate depression in MH. I guess where the cap rates now in MH, RV and marina? And have you changed at all the past several weeks as rates have come to the forefront here?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah, I can’t say I’ve seen any change things probably on their work. So it takes more than a couple of weeks, if there’s going to be some change. But we’re currently seeing and have been seeing continued cap rate compression in MH and RV. Certainly, everything is trading in the low-4s and much of it is trading sub-4 and the 3s. That pressure and the shortage of assets has continued with cap rate compression. On the marina side and hence, by the way, the reason where we think we can build a manufactured housing community to a far better return than buying something at one of those cap rates. We still have a good pipeline. We’re probably in the low-4s and mid-4s in our pipeline, where we’re transacting. On the marina side, we’ve seen since Sun’s announcement, more interest in the marina activity. Certainly, the sale of Sun tax and recapitalization with Centerbridge. We’ve seen them acquire more properties at tighter cap rates. So we’re probably expecting to see 50 basis point to 100 basis point compression in marinas over the next year or so as the interest remains. And what we’re pretty much seeing is that we’re buying anywhere from the 6, 6.5 to 8, 8.5 cap rate range in the marinas. And we’ll watch that closely as the year goes by.\nAnthony Powell: Thanks for the detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Hey, thanks for the time. On the five manufactured housing greenfield development starts, could you share the stabilized yield underwritten and the time to stabilization?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: John, this is Fernando. On these projects, we’re looking to stabilize within four to five years on the manufactured housing side within four to five years on the manufactured housing side and cash on cash yield for those in the 6% to 7% range. When you compare that to, as Gary was saying, acquisition cap rates in the low-4s or sub-4, in many instances, we were developing to pretty healthy development yields or development spreads.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then Fernando, could you share the transient revenue growth assumption that underpins the 6.6 to 6.9 guidance. And having trouble reconciling John’s remarks for reservation paces well above I think he said 50% above where it was a year ago, but the sharp moderation in NOI you are forecasting?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Well, the moderation in NOI is really a more normalized year in 2021 from a comp standpoint, that did grow RV. Same community NOI growth grew by almost 29%. Last year, that’s really, given the COVID impact during 2020. So there is some moderation. But it’s really from a comp perspective, I would say the – in our budget, our RV transients same property growth is projected for the year is probably in the 10% to 12% range.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could give a walk of the 1Q guidance. It’s obviously a similar number to what it was last year. And it really hasn’t changed over the past couple of years. So I’m curious is that just because the acquired FFO has been highly seasonal? Or is there a unique headwind this year, maybe like the G&A that you were talking about previously, that that’s depressing it?\nKaren Dearing: This is really a seasonality item, as you mentioned. There’s growth in dollars about the fall in Q1, but it is the lowest quarterly contribution to FFO. And it has the greatest impact of weighted average share increase year-over-year, because of the timing of our equity raises in 2021. So nothing unusual about the quarter, but for that it’s the lowest contribution because of seasonality and because of the impact of weighted average share.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, got it. And maybe for you as well, Karen. Can you just talk through the funding picture for the year? Obviously, you have the the $1 billion-plus in unsettled forwards, but should we expect to see like a sterling debt offering potentially at some point or any other expected capital markets activity, given what you know now?\nGary Shiffman: We will evaluate capital markets over the course of the year. The sterling denominated bond market is certainly open – will be open to us once we close the Park Holidays transaction in a fantastic way to naturally hedge our investments in the UK. We will complement that with continuing our path on the unsecured bond issuance in the U.S. as well from a debt capital perspective. And then as investment opportunities come up, we will look to other capital markets as well.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I’d like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nGary Shiffman: We want to thank everybody for participating on the call today. And as we always close, John, Fernando, myself and Karen are always available for any follow-up, and we look forward to speaking to you on the first quarter earnings call. Thank you, operator.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Karen Dearing",
            "content": "Thanks, John. For the fourth quarter, Sun reported core FFO per share of $1.31, 12.9% above the prior year. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, core FFO per share was $6.51, which was $0.01 ahead of the top end of our 2021 revised guidance and an increase of 27.9% from 2020. During 2021 and through the date of this call, Sun acquired approximately $1.5 billion of operating properties and approximately $173 million in land for our development growth initiatives. To support this growth, Sun raised approximately $2.2 billion in equity and our operating partnership issued $1.2 billion in senior unsecured notes. This capital market activity provides us with continued capacity to pursue our growth initiatives and maintain a well-positioned balance sheet. Sun ended 2021 with $5.7 billion of debt outstanding at a 3% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 8.8 years. We had $65.8 million unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12 months recurring EBITDA ratio of 5.7 times. On a pro forma basis, including our fully loaded trailing 12-month EBITDA and our forward equity issuances, our net debt to EBITDA would be in the mid 4 times. With regard to our outlook for 2022, we expect core FFO to be in the range of $7.07 to $7.23 per share and for the first quarter of 2022, core FFO to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.27 per share. Our 2022 manufactured housing in RV same property NOI growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 6.8%, and our marina same property NOI growth is expected to be in the range of 6% to 7.4%. The 2022 same property pools have 428 manufactured housing in RV properties and 101 marinas. We anticipate MH and annual RV revenue-producing site gains throughout the year to be between 2,500 to 2,800, with over 60% coming from transient RV conversions to annual leases and the balance of gains in our manufactured housing communities. On the development front, we plan to deliver between 1,600 to 2,000 vacant expansion and ground-up development sites in 2022. Our 2022 G&A expense is projected to be in the range of $231 million to $236 million. As Gary and John mentioned, we have a strong track record and industry-leading position and we are seeing favorable tailwind supporting continued momentum. To further optimize our position and maximize the growth opportunities, we are making a number of investments in our platform and our team members. In addition to the Sun Outdoors rebranding that John discussed, we are making strategic investments in our business, specifically in our technology and people resources to support a new enterprise resource planning or ERP system launching later this year as well as continuing to build the Safe Harbor infrastructure to support anticipated growth. Please refer to our supplemental information for additional disclosures on the assumptions used to prepare our 2022 guidance and expected seasonality within Sun's portfolio, as actual future events may not coincide with the assumptions used to prepare the 2022 guidance. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call and the anticipated closing of Park Holidays in mid-March. It does not include the impact of other prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator? Yeah, G&A for Sun and Safe Harbor is the $231 million, I think, to $236 million. The Park Holidays acquisition, which is expected in mid-March and the additional I think it is around $29 million to $30.5 of G&A. I think – could you ask that question again, to be sure that we understand that? It's like that – so you're referring to the 7.5% at the midpoint of growth and expenses, John. So really, with the – that is made up 50% of that. The increase is made up of three things. The first is really that proactive wage increase that we discussed last year, and we said be partially impacting 2021. And the other piece impacts the first half of 2022. And that's about an $8 million impact on salaries and wages. In the first half of the year, the other two items are real estate tax assessments. Florida and Texas in expansion and development properties are seeing increased real estate tax assessments. And the other piece of it is really are the advertising spend. So those are the things that are increasing the expense growth. If you removed the $8 million from the wage and salary increases, our expense growth would be just a little above 5%. So Park Holidays is not in the $231 million to $236 million increase. That's a separate bucket. G&A is really a reflection of the investments we're making to continue to deliver our outsized growth. We have a great track record on executing on our strategies and we have strong tailwind. So we are net year-over-year growth. It's really made up of continuing to build Safe Harbor, their infrastructure as they've increased their size, as Gary said, a little over 60% in the last 15 months and they'll continue to consolidate that market. So pieces Safe Harbor, quarter of it is. Another quarter is related to the RV rebranding that John discussed, and the remaining half of the G&A increase is investments in our overall platform, including a new ERP system, which will be coming on board later this year. Wages and deferred stock compensation, we need to continue to build our best-in-class team and retain our best-in-class team. And then we have some other costs associated with strategic initiative with ESG reporting, the EI initiatives, data analytics, and also some costs related to ensure the success of the UK investment. So that's really the drivers for the G&A increase. Yeah, yeah. This is really a seasonality item, as you mentioned. There's growth in dollars about the fall in Q1, but it is the lowest quarterly contribution to FFO. And it has the greatest impact of weighted average share increase year-over-year, because of the timing of our equity raises in 2021. So nothing unusual about the quarter, but for that it's the lowest contribution because of seasonality and because of the impact of weighted average share."

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and provide and overview of our 2022 guidance. The accelerated growth we delivered this past year is a testament to the resilience, desirability and favorable positioning of our best-in-class portfolio. As the largest owner and operator of manufactured housing communities, RV resorts and marinas, we are uniquely positioned to meet customer needs across all of our platforms. The ongoing demand for attainable housing and outdoor vacationing and leisure activities has continued tailwinds for some. With this backdrop, we've delivered industry-leading and sustained earnings growth, as well as meaningful value creation with our strategic acquisitions. For the year, core FFO per share increased nearly 28% and same community NOI grew 11.2% over 2020, building further on the growth we delivered throughout the pandemic, driven by high occupancy and rent increases. We added approximately 2,500 revenue-producing sites and total home sales increased nearly 43% as compared to the prior year, demonstrating the high demand to live in a Sun community. On the external growth front, during 2021 and through the date of this call, we acquired approximately $1.5 billion of properties and invested approximately $173 million in land for development to build out in the coming years. In the fourth quarter, we realized yet another milestone achievement, with the announced pending acquisition of Park Holidays for approximately $1.3 billion, which is anticipated to close mid-March. Park Holidays is the second largest owner and operator of holiday parks in the UK, with 40 owned and two managed communities. Their business model is nearly identical to that Sun's manufactured housing platform. And this transaction allows us to apply a proven expertise and track record to a fragmented market, further expanding our opportunities and accelerating our growth potential. For the RV business, many travelers continue to discover the enjoyment and affordability of an RV vacation. The ongoing demand and interest in the RV lifestyle at Sun Outdoors is evident with accelerated same community RV revenue growth of nearly 25% compared to 2020. And compared to 2019, the same community RV NOI CAGR increased by 12%. We believe tailwinds support continued demand and a shift in consumer behavior with a strong desire to experience the great outdoors. RV sales continue to increase in volume, with RV shipments surpassing 600,000 for 2021, an all-time high for the industry. We are also pleased with the growth we are capturing in the marina business. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, both sales in 2021 surpassed 300,000 units for the second consecutive year, indicating continued demand. Through the end of 2021 starting with the acquisition of Safe Harbor in October of 2020, we have added 125 marinas to our portfolio, including 19 in 2021, and we maintain an active pipeline that will continue to feed our growth and shareholder returns. The longstanding relationships with Safe Harbor team has in the marina industry, the ability to transact with tax deferred securities, and Sun's attractive cost of capital have made Safe Harbor the premier marina consolidator. At the foundation of this growth and success, our Sun's core attributes, which encompass our commitment to our team members, including empowerment and accountability, leadership and governance as well as sustainability. We are pleased to have greatly enhanced our ESG disclosures and established a baseline from which to demonstrate improvements. We recently published our Annual ESG Report, and we responded to three voluntary frameworks in 2021. This year, Sun will continue to submit responses to these frameworks, improve in areas of identified opportunity, integrate green building practices into our new developments and incorporate the marina platform into our ESG reporting process. With confidence in Sun's continued ability to generate industry-leading results, our Board has raised our 2022 distributions of $3.52 per share, up 6% from last year. 2021 was another year of outsized growth for Sun as we continue to expand through acquisitions, expansions, and new MH and RV community developments in addition to consolidating the marina sector. Our unparalleled focus on delivering the best customer experience and optimizing our operating platform is evident in our track record. We're proud of this track record and recognize that we need to continue to invest in our platform, technology and innovation to deliver industry-leading growth for years to come. Supported by a favorable macro environment, we are confident that Sun has uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity as we execute on our strategic priorities. We are grateful for our dedicated team members' daily commitment as we enhance our offerings and deliver growth with continued best-in-class customer service across the entire Sun platform for our residents, guests, members and all shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John and Karen to discuss our results and guidance in further detail. Yeah, I can take. This is Gary. And I think that I would characterize it as not much in the category of surprises, but very pleased in the performance as expected and underwritten. Again, I think what's Sun's core strength is identifying business platforms that have strong demand and low supply with high barriers to entry when we think of MH and RV and discussed how marinas is very, very similar to that. It's performed in a manner that we underwrote to and so we continue to see a demand fact that Safe Harbor has been a leader in the marina network, its membership continues to grow, occupancies remain high, rental increases are rock solid. So pretty much what we were looking for and the opportunity to continue to consolidate the industry as fragmented as it is, is very exciting. And the pipeline in the marina area allows us to be very, very strategic in our thinking over at Safe Harbor, as the acquisitions team is able to really choose and be very, very selective on acquiring properties that will meet the travel patterns of the membership, as well as create the highest opportunity for growth. So pretty much what we had hoped for. And so we're pleasantly pleased as opposed to surprise. No, the question always comes up about capital allocation. And we've always shared the fact that we will continue to deploy capital across all three business lines, and it's our relationships in all lines, including manufactured housing that have allowed us to continue to acquire, I think, what we are finding, there is further compression in the cap rates and on the MH and RV side. So where we can get great growth, we will look to deploy capital. So that includes marinas and includes the growth of Park Holidays in the UK as we view it as the stickiest type of revenue, because it is basically our manufactured housing community model. So I think those are two areas we will continue to focus on. The third is John just said in his remarks relates to the capital that we've been investing and continue to invest to grow our MH platform through greenfield development. So this coming year, John said, we're expecting to open up or start construction on five new manufactured housing communities. We'd like to see that be a minimum of five new communities per year at least. And therefore, there'll be a lot of capital allocation to that new development of manufactured housing communities here in the U.S. The only thing that I would remind everybody is that no future acquisitions. And I guess as Karen says, capital transactions are actually built into our 2022 growth. So to the extent that we continue with the type of pipeline we have now that would be additive to growth this coming year. Thank you. I just want to clarify John, 6.7% at the midpoint, not 5.7% is what Fernando shared. I think generally, from rate and continued scale, occupancy remains very strong. And similar, although we did grow by almost 60% in size in the marina platform in the last 16, 17 months. So enormous growth there, and it's just pretty much continued operations where we have demand that just far exceeds the steps in the strategic locations that we have. So it's rental rate growth. Along with that, there is a component of ancillary incomes and that's not in the same community separate. So yeah, rental growth, little bit of increased occupancy and also CapEx revenue-generating investment too [ph] have strong returns. Okay, sorry. I think like I'll share with you the following. When I talk about Sun's really strength and ability to identify platforms that have high demand, low supply, high barriers to entry. Each one of these that we enter into require a very thoughtful, detailed underwriting. And as we share with a market on our transformed of transactions over the last 10 years, let's just say, we look to gain scale and do gain accretion above the core portfolio in a one to two-year period of time after integrating the transformative transaction. So our expectation would be that we would begin to scale and seeing increased leveraged results in our earnings sometime throughout the next year, the marina platform. And then when we look at Park Holidays, although John and I would share very, very similar to our manufactured housing business here, it is a foreign country with FX, with accounting and taxation and regulation. So as we approach it, I think what we do best is kind of crawl and walk before we run. So there is an effort on the G&A side to reflect a bit of insurance, so to speak, that we deliver the results that our stakeholders and shareholders are looking for. So again, in 12 to 24 months out after the closing, we would love to be able to scale and see further reductions in growth of the G&A. I think that we've seen large growth in year-over-year G&A for the last couple of years, I think that's going to pay strong dividends. And we're going to be able to post strong growth as we go forward. But certainly, Park Holidays and our entrance into the UK is causing us to be very, very cautious and conservative with how we begin to undertake operating in the UK. No, I'd say we're very, very focused on staying within the platforms that we have, but we're extraordinarily excited to be able to ramp up the MH land lease type of community, both in Australia revenue – in Australia with our JV with Ingenia, as well as Park Holidays and growing that platform, very, very sticky revenue again, as been indicated by history. The Park Holidays platform we think of as very similar to our snowbird manufactured housing communities in Florida and Arizona and elsewhere, where these are second home owners. They must own a primary home by law in order to qualify for buying a home in the holiday parks. So the seasonality that you see as well as created by that pretty much coincides with the school year in the UK. So we will focus on taking the opportunity to consolidate a very fragmented industry in the UK, just as we've done in the marinas, and then in the U.S., we'll continue growing our MH and RV platform. And as we talked about before, dive deeper into the new manufactured housing community development. So we really got a great strategic plan going forward. And I don't see anything in the pipeline that would change from that. So I'm going to turn that over to John. He stepped into the designated board position some time ago, and really the best one to address that. The only thing I'd add to that longer-term, as we grow out the platform and increase the communities, we see that we'll be able to move the sales operation from new community to new communities. So as a percentage of the overall income, the sales will reduce. Therefore, the pitch fees will increase. And as they're recognized on a monthly basis, I would expect three, five years out that there will be less seasonality because the monthly pitch fees will be a much greater percentage than the sales revenues today. It would be the monthly fees, we call it rent collected – site rent. They're the equivalent of site rent in the UK vernacular. They have a more or less permanent home on them. Yeah, I think everything really drives towards the growth in annual leases within our communities. I mean, the starting point in the evolution of RV is people come out more on a short-term basis to stay the weekend, they might have a pop up. And they might start off as tent campers when they come in. And they sort of graduate through it all to hopefully meet come conversions of transient guests to annual leases, which, as we shared before, provides a 50% uplift in revenue in that first year. And so, the strategy behind it was one, we have an incredibly beautiful portfolio of properties that we've accumulated over the last 10 years is to layer a brand over it, okay, providing the highest quality resorts and unparalleled customer experience and satisfaction. And by organizing that into a set of properties of segmentation, which Sun Outdoors is going to be for more short-term stays, Sun treats for seasonal stays of the annuals I was talking about a minute ago, and then some resorts and residences for 55-plus communities. And so as you sort of align that up against what we have today, and the goal of converting people along the way and the success that we've had, like we had last year with over 1,700 conversions of short-term guests to long-term leases, and what we shared in our guidance, the bigger portion of our RPS gains are going to be associated with those conversions. And then add that to the pipeline of sites that we have that are opportunities for conversions. It all kind of flows together, which is sort of the business case for launching the brand being more organized around it and flowing our guests through those – through the lifecycle of a guest and RV resort. Ironically, as I said before, it's really a mirror image of what we do currently in our manufactured housing communities and especially the areas where the snowbirds come in. So they're up in often their northern homes during the nice part of the year. And then they head down to their second home, their vacation home, down in Florida and Arizona and other places where we have. One of the things that we're strategically looking at as we continue to look to expand our manufactured housing community portfolio, is the concept of more vacations, second homes. And so we're looking in areas where people want to vacation, or they want to be outdoors close to their outdoor habits of skiing or biking and hiking and things like that. So coincidentally, very similar to the Park Holidays model that exists, which is mostly coastal within a two, three-hour ride of London and most heavily populated areas in the UK. So something we were already looking at and something that intrigued us when we saw that that model already existed in the UK. So it's kind of a bit of a coincidence that we identified the opportunity and have an opportunity to take a fragmented and consolidated vacation, second home opportunity in the UK, and kind of a season. At the same time, we are currently trying to build that model in the U.S. So I'm sure there'll be a lot of transatlantic learning, so to speak, back and forth. So it is a good point. Yeah, I can't say I've seen any change things probably on their work. So it takes more than a couple of weeks, if there's going to be some change. But we're currently seeing and have been seeing continued cap rate compression in MH and RV. Certainly, everything is trading in the low-4s and much of it is trading sub-4 and the 3s. That pressure and the shortage of assets has continued with cap rate compression. On the marina side and hence, by the way, the reason where we think we can build a manufactured housing community to a far better return than buying something at one of those cap rates. We still have a good pipeline. We're probably in the low-4s and mid-4s in our pipeline, where we're transacting. On the marina side, we've seen since Sun's announcement, more interest in the marina activity. Certainly, the sale of Sun tax and recapitalization with Centerbridge. We've seen them acquire more properties at tighter cap rates. So we're probably expecting to see 50 basis point to 100 basis point compression in marinas over the next year or so as the interest remains. And what we're pretty much seeing is that we're buying anywhere from the 6, 6.5 to 8, 8.5 cap rate range in the marinas. And we'll watch that closely as the year goes by. We will evaluate capital markets over the course of the year. The sterling denominated bond market is certainly open – will be open to us once we close the Park Holidays transaction in a fantastic way to naturally hedge our investments in the UK. We will complement that with continuing our path on the unsecured bond issuance in the U.S. as well from a debt capital perspective. And then as investment opportunities come up, we will look to other capital markets as well. We want to thank everybody for participating on the call today. And as we always close, John, Fernando, myself and Karen are always available for any follow-up, and we look forward to speaking to you on the first quarter earnings call. Thank you, operator."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael. This is Fernando. As you – I think the biggest indicator is going to be our same property growth, that's always going to be the leader from delivering growth year-over-year. At the midpoint, our manufactured housing and RV platform is expected to grow by 6.4% NOI this year, and the marina platform at the midpoint again, is expected to grow by 6.7%. That's always going to be the largest contributor. And then we have other levers to pull, like the acquisition of operating properties, the development and fill-up of our expansion properties in existing communities, as well as Gary just said, the hopeful acceleration of investment in our ground-up development projects, those are going to be the largest components that are going to deliver year-over-year growth. John, this is Fernando. On these projects, we're looking to stabilize within four to five years on the manufactured housing side within four to five years on the manufactured housing side and cash on cash yield for those in the 6% to 7% range. When you compare that to, as Gary was saying, acquisition cap rates in the low-4s or sub-4, in many instances, we were developing to pretty healthy development yields or development spreads. Well, the moderation in NOI is really a more normalized year in 2021 from a comp standpoint, that did grow RV. Same community NOI growth grew by almost 29%. Last year, that's really, given the COVID impact during 2020. So there is some moderation. But it's really from a comp perspective, I would say the – in our budget, our RV transients same property growth is projected for the year is probably in the 10% to 12% range."

            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Sun delivered yet another year of strong results in 2021. Our operational strength across the entire platform is a testament to our unrivaled team managing a best-in-class portfolio. In the fourth quarter, same community NOI increased by 8.4% compared to the same period in 2020. It was driven by an 8.5% increase in revenues, reflecting a 3.6% increase in weighted average monthly rent, a 140 basis point occupancy gain and 15% growth in transient RV revenues. To further provide detail, manufactured housing same community NOI increased by 6.7% and the RV segment same community NOI grew by 14.1%. For the full year, same community NOI increased by 11.2% over the prior year. The NOI increase was mainly due to an 11.8% increase in revenues, offset by a 13.1% increase in expenses. The expense growth was mainly driven by our RV same community in line with increased transient RV revenues. Same community MH revenues increased by 5.7% and RV revenues grew by 24.8% with contributions from occupancy and rate increases. Our $1.4 billion of operating property acquisitions for the year included 11 manufactured housing communities, 24 RV resorts and 19 marinas with over 15,800 sites wet slips and dry storage spaces. Year-to-date, in 2022, we have closed on two marinas and one bolt-on for approximately $62 million. We are seeing sustained demand for attainable housing affordable vacationing. The applications to live in a Sun community averaged approximately 50,000 applications per year for the last five years, including over 55,000 applications in 2021. Home sales increased by 28.4% for new homes and 46.2% for pre-owned homes as compared to 2020. Brokered home sales increased by 38% for the year, with an average sales price of 27%. We gained nearly 2,500 revenue-producing sites during the year, with almost 1,700 coming from RV transient, the annual conversions a record high for Sun. With each conversion of transient site to annual lease, we gain an average of 50% revenue uplift within the first year. Total portfolio occupancy as of December 31, 2021 was 97.4%, which provides us with the potential for continued occupancy gains as we fill up vacant sites. In addition, we have an attractive growth pipeline as we continue building new sites in our expansion communities and ground-up developments. To that end, Sun delivered over 1,600 expansion in ground-up development sites at 19 properties in 2021. These include two newly opened manufactured housing communities with a total build out of nearly 600 sites. Our pipeline of land for future expansion in greenfield development continues to grow with the acquisition of approximately $173 million in land for future development, where there is strong demand for attainable housing and vacationing. During 2022, we expect to begin construction of five new greenfield MH communities, which when fully built out, will add approximately 1,500 new MH sites to Sun's portfolio. Over the past five-plus years, we've been building our development platform in order to build new modern MH communities for better returns than the cost of acquiring existing MH communities in these locations. We believe this work and investment will provide Sun with a significant competitive advantage as we look to grow our MH portfolio over the next one to five years. As of year-end, we had nearly 11,000 zone and titled sites available for expansion in new development. Forward bookings to our Sun owned and operate RV resorts are pacing 62% ahead of last year for the first quarter and 53% ahead of the first half of the year. This pacing year-over-year provides us with confidence that demand for RV vacation and lifestyle remains strong and we are further investing in this segment to reinforce our leading position and drive ongoing demand in Sun resorts. In 2022, this investment includes an RV rebranding and supporting media campaign as we launch our new branding for our RV resorts, Sun Outdoors. For example, at the end of November, we launched our Sun Outdoors YouTube channel, and are producing a number of videos series featuring various vacation options at our RV resorts. Additionally, our proprietary Sun Outdoors' mobile app was released live this past quarter. The app offers an image rich streamlined booking experience for our branded Sun Outdoors and sun retreat destinations. Our social media strategy continues to be the top tier performer in the outdoor lifestyle industry as guests explore their Sun of your side. Within our Marina business, we acquired 19 new marina properties in 2021, including five in the fourth quarter. Same marina rental revenue growth for properties owned and managed by Safe Harbor since 2019 was 17.8% for the full year 2021 over 2019, which is a CAGR increase of rental revenue of 7.4% for the quarter and 8.5% for the year. The main drivers of the revenue increase this quarter was strong wet and dry storage revenues, resulting from rate and occupancy increases across the portfolio. During 2021, we consistently execute on our four core investment strategies. First, reinvesting in our existing communities leads to steady demand and high occupancy to live in Sun's properties; second, the acquisition of accretive properties continues to add revenue and cash flow; third, expansion in our existing properties provides occupancy revenue growth and high demand, low supply markets; and fourth, ground-up developments provide Sun with the ability to build the highest quality communities for our residents and guests while achieving high returns for our shareholders. This year, with our continued reinvestment in our communities, acquisition of over 50 operating properties, delivery of over 1,600 development sites and opening the first phases of two manufactured housing and two RV redevelopments, Sun successfully executed on each of these four core strategic pillars. Going into 2022, we are successfully executing our core strategies and continue the momentum to yield industry-leading growth, which is [ph] and continue the momentum to yield industry-leading growth, which could not be possible without our entire Sun team. Karen will now discuss our financial results and guidance for 2022. Karen? Keegan, this is John. Actually, I don't have that breakout between all age and 55-plus. We can certainly get back to you on that. Michael, our forecasts would include the additional three-day weekend in the middle of June. And we can get back to you on the expected revenue growth in our budget for transient. Hey, Josh, how you doing? As we've – as we shared before, I think everybody know that Australians had a pretty strict response with respect to COVID. So there's been some delays. But that said, our JV, Ingenia, we've actually acquired two additional untitled parcels in 2021. So we actually now have five new developments that are underway. One is actually – one is open and selling homes nicely, and we expect three of the remainders to start construction this year. So as we might have shared on other calls, it's been, unfortunately, a couple of years since Gary or I have been able to go out, look forward to getting my feet back on the ground out there now that things opened up and you see in these three developments start to be built. So I think things are really going to accelerate. Josh, the seasonality of Park Holidays is really, as Gary just mentioned, the seasons – the season there is really between April to October. We do recognize pitch fee income over the course of the 12 months. But the activity at the properties is really during the second and third quarter, just like you would expect from our Northern RV properties here in the U.S. and Canada. Wes, this is John. I think it's actually – I don't know the exact percentage, but I'm sure it's pretty big share, because we spent six years building this pipeline of development. And as we might have shared before, we've got over 10,000 sites in various stages of entitlement today, plus more that we're looking at behind that. And so it's – we do here about, I would say, probably more smaller RV development that's taking place like people bolting on 30 sites, 20 sites, things like that to existing communities and there are some new ground-ups that have taken place. But I think on the MH side, I believe that we are sort of uniquely positioned in leading the industry in terms of what we're developing, just because it does take as long as it takes to build that pipeline as we have for the last five, six years. Yeah, for sure. The biggest pieces that we currently own 21 Jellystones in the portfolio today. So it was really a strategic acquisition, for us to enhance what we believe is a really important camping – family camping brand and put our know-how to it and merge it together. So that, frankly, we control the brand message, the reach and the guests experience is really important to us. So it's more strategic in nature. And when you look at what's taking place over the course of 2021, with having over 230,000 new guests to our resorts, the tailwinds that are happening, the booking pace that we're seeing with 62% ahead of the first quarter of last year, and over 50% ahead of the first half of last year, adding on the launch of Sun Outdoors, our social strategy, the new website, mobile app, other platforms that are engaging idle RVs that are sitting in people's backyards, to monetize that and get more rigs out onto the road. And so that inherent demand is increasing. That seemed like a very logical thing to do from a strategic nature to extend the brand that we have just launched with Sun Outdoors. I was – the split of gross profits which will mirror EBITDA contribution for 2022 and some of the high 30% from the sale of homes, the – and then the rest of it split. You've got about 30% coming from site fees with owners in – on those properties, about 20% the transient vacation rental stays and the balance in an F&B, retail, dining and entertainment. There is a small amount of homes that are depreciated that would be backed out of FFO. But it's, call it, about 15%, 20%. I think I would add, Anthony, the conversions that John talks about represent a first year uplift of about 50%, okay, first year uplift of about 50%, okay, in revenue. So when we talked about the returns, and we looked at all the returns on the investment, that is a big part of what is created there. And right in our wheelhouse."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings. Thank you for joining us today for Sun Communities Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will begin after the formal presentation. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our third quarter 2021 results. Strong third quarter is a continuation of the momentum we have historically demonstrated, which reflects both the stability and the growth potential of a platform we have established. This includes organic growth, expansions and developments and acquisitions. The combination of these elements allowed us to deliver 31.9% growth in core FFO per share during the third quarter and exceeded the high end of our guidance. This beat, along with a positive outlook for the remainder of the year once again, led us to raise our core 2021 FFO guidance by $0.16 at the midpoint for a range of $6.44 to $6.50 per share and are expected the same community NOI growth for the full-year at 70 basis points for a range of 10.9% to 11.1%. For the quarter, same community NOI grew 12.4% over last year, driven by our favorable strategic positioning to capture the sustained demand in RVs. In our RV segment, same community NOI increased by 30.6% for the quarter as transient RV continued to deliver exceptionally strong results. Our RV Resort business is benefiting from people seeking outdoor experiences at Sun RV resorts coming from both existing and new customers. RVing is establishing itself as the vacation choice for many travelers, and we have positioned the Sun to capture this demand at scale. We are continuing to see momentum in forward bookings for transient as well as annual site conversions. Furthermore, the opening of the Canadian border in November is expected to accelerate that momentum in the first quarter of next year as we welcome back our Canadian Snowbird residents and guests. The stability of our manufactured housing portfolio continues to show the need for attainable housing as evidenced by our home sales volume and applications to live in a Sun community. Manufactured home sales were another bright spot in the quarter. The total home sales volume up nearly 64% from the prior year and brokered home sales up over 15% for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2020. Our core pillars of delivering superior customer service, maintaining high quality communities and offering an attainable housing option continue to create strong demand to live in a Sun community. In our Marina segment, we are pleased that results continue to track ahead of our underwriting. Our NOI increases this quarter [indiscernible] primarily from the continued demand for wet slips and dry storage needs for our members. Forward demand for dry storage and wet slip rental is ahead of where they were at this time last year in large part through our best-in-class marina network, locations and services. We have also remained active in growing and improving our portfolio. In the third quarter and through the date of this earnings call, we added 22 properties across our three segments deploying over $500 million of capital and adding over 7,400 sites. Our recently acquired Four Leaf Portfolio of nine manufactured housing communities in the Midwest comprises over 2,500 high quality sites with expansion growth opportunities and ample room to fill existing vacancies. On the marina side, our acquisitions of Puerto del Rey in Puerto Rico, the largest marina in the Caribbean continues to strengthen our irreplaceable network of marina assets. Puerto del Rey now allows for a Safe Harbor member to remain within the network while traveling from the Northeast all the way down to the Caribbean. Our acquisition teams remain extremely active and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities we are seeing across each of Sun's business segments. Furthermore, we have a proven track record of maximizing value from our acquisitions as we integrate them on to the Sun platform. This includes adding value through our operational platform, proprietary technologies, the scale of our marketing and booking platforms, including Campspot and potential repositioning of acquired properties. As the leading industry consolidator, we believe our cycle tested ability to create value through acquisitions will continue to result in attractive accretive growth. This activity is supported by the ongoing proactive focus and maintaining financial flexibility. Additionally, we are continually evaluating our portfolio for assets which no longer fit with our long-term strategic and growth objectives. To that end, in the third quarter, we completed the disposition of six assets for a total sales price of $162 million, representing a blended cap rate of low 4s, which further demonstrates the value of Sun's portfolio. We have a deep bench of incredibly talented team members, a well-positioned balance sheet, and a healthy pipeline of internal and external growth opportunities and we remain optimistic in our ability to deliver on each of our performance objectives. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational performance. John?\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. Sun delivered a strong third quarter across the Board outperforming our previous expectations. Our results reflect the combination of the stability of our best-in-class portfolio, as well as the contributions from our growth initiatives across all three of our business segments. For the third quarter, combined same community manufactured housing and RV NOI increased 12.4% from the third quarter 2020. The growth in NOI was driven by a 12.8% revenue gain supported by a 150 basis point increase in occupancy to 98.9% and a 3.7% weighted average rental rate increase. Our expenses were up 13.7% from the prior year. Same community manufactured housing NOI increased by 2.6% from 2020 and same community RV NOI increased by 30.6%. Annual RV growth was 50.2% for the quarter as a result of a 5% rental rate increase and the effect of over 1,500 conversions to annual leases over the trailing 12 months. RV transient revenues were up 29% compared to last year. This is on top of the 5% transient growth we experienced in the third quarter of 2020 over 2019 when we began to see the benefits of travelers who were seeking drive-to vacation options and took advantage of our resorts and desirable destinations. When we issued second quarter results in late July, we shared the transient RV revenue for the second half of the year was 15.2% ahead of the original budget. Today and accounting for the third quarter’s actual contribution, it has accelerated to 18.3% ahead of original budget. As of this earnings call, our fourth quarter transient RV revenue is 19.6% ahead of the original budget. The increased levels of consumer engagement discussed last quarter have continued. Year-to-date RV website traffic is up 10% compared to last year and 120% compared to 2019 and we have seen our social media following and interaction continue to grow with more than 1.4 million followers on the three major platforms, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Our best salespeople have always been our residents and guests and their reach to spread the word has been meaningfully amplified through our social media engagement. We have also continued to sign up members to our pilots and RV Resorts loyalty program. And while it's still in its early days, initial interest and feedback have been very positive. In short, we believe we are seeing strong evidence of two important trends. First, that many travelers are learning up and trying out an RV vacation, and second, once travelers have discovered their sunnier side through an RV vacation, it becomes part of their future vacation considerations. Additionally, Sun has simplified the reservation process with our Campspot platform, which in turn enhances the demand for RV vacation at Sun RV Resorts. With respect to our total MH and RV portfolio, we continue to pursue our strategy of filling existing vacancy and creating additional revenue producing opportunities through expansion and conversions. In the third quarter, we gained 576 revenue producing sites. Of our revenue producing site gains over 430 were transient RV sites converted to annual leases with the balance being added to our manufactured housing expansion communities. We have now converted almost 1,200 transient RV sites to annual leases year-to-date, which exceeds any prior full-year figure and demonstrates the successful execution of this internal growth lever. The RV site conversions resulted in an average 50% increase in site revenues during the first year of conversion with an additional benefit of transient site [indiscernible] rates. Moving on to new construction. In the third quarter, we delivered over 320 new sites, approximately 70% of which were Greenfield ground-up developments and the remainder were expansions to existing communities. One of the ground-up developments delivered this quarter was the next phase of Smith Creek Crossing, a manufactured housing community in Granby, Colorado. The first phase of 82 sites has been filling up rapidly since opening a year ago, and we anticipate this next phase to continue to see the high demand for attainable housing in the area. MH home sales in the third quarter were also strong. Total sales volume was up 64% year-over-year as we sold more than 1,100 homes in the quarter. These results are clear reflection of the value proposition that a Sun manufactured housing community offers the healthy demand for these homes and the home value that is maintained in our communities. Applications to live in a Sun community are up 13.2% year-to-date, and we anticipate we will continue to see strength in our manufactured housing business, given the tight housing market and the demand for quality attainable housing. Turning to the Marina business. We ended the quarter with 120 properties comprising nearly 45,000 wet slips and dry storage spaces, which includes the acquisition of six properties for approximately $250 million completed in the third quarter. Same marina rental revenue growth for the portfolio of 75 properties owned and operated by Safe Harbor since the start of 2019 was 17.8% for the nine months of 2021 over 2019. This is a CAGR increase in rental revenue of 9.9% for the quarter and 8.5% year-to-date through the end of September 2021. Better-than-expected performance for the Marina portfolio continues to come from demand for wet slips and dry storage spaces. We have also witnessed higher margins on the service business with Lauderdale Marine Center and Riva, which being the leading contributors to this outperformance. Great service creates stronger slip rental demand and higher member retention. In summary, Sun's growth engines continued to deliver strong results. Our internal levers are driven by the fundamentals of Sun's operating platform and by expansion site deliveries. Our total MH portfolio stands at approximately 97% occupancy, providing us with more than 200 basis points of occupancy upside as well as additional growth potential by adding further expansion sites over time. In the RV business, robust transient demand continues, and we also anticipate continued momentum and conversions of transient annual leases each year. We expect to build on our successful track record of delivering and filling expansion sites. We have an inventory of 7,500 expansion sites, portion of which we intend to strategically deliver each year targeting 10% to 14% unlevered IRRs. In addition, our external growth pipeline is robust across all three businesses with opportunities to continue to consolidate each industry as well as pursuing selective ground-up developments. We are pleased with our performance year-to-date, and we expect to continue delivering on our objectives. Karen will now discuss our financial results in more detail. Karen?\nKaren Dearing: Thanks, John. For the third quarter, Sun reported core FFO per share of $2.11, 31.9% above the prior year and $0.05 ahead of the top-end of our third quarter guidance range. Outperformance was achieved across annual and transient RV and marinas. During and subsequent to the quarter end, we acquired approximately $500 million of operating properties, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.1 billion, adding 38 properties, totaling nearly 12,000 sites. To support our operations and grow expectations, we have been active in enhancing our balance sheet and in capital markets activity, which provide the capacity and flexibility to pursue our ongoing growth pipeline. Last quarter, we received investment grade ratings, which provides us with an additional attractive source of financing. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes and our second bond offering of the year across seven and 10-year maturities. Additionally, we utilized our ATM program and completed the sale of 21.4 million of forward shares of common stock. We ended the second quarter with $4.7 billion of debt outstanding at a 3.3% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 9.6 years. As of September 30, we had $72 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio of 4.9x. We are raising our full-year 2021 core FFO guidance to a range of $6.44 to $6.50 per share, a $0.16 increase at the midpoint from our prior range. The increase includes our outperformance in the third quarter with the remainder due to contributions from recent acquisitions and increased expectations across each of our businesses. We expect core FFO for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.30 per share. We are also increasing full-year same community NOI growth guidance to a range of 10.9% to 11.1%, up 70 basis points from the previous midpoint of guidance of 10.3%. The fourth quarter same community NOI growth guidance is 7.2% to 8%. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which maybe included in research analyst estimates. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you. I was hoping you could provide some more commentary around the marina performance versus underwriting, so for a full-year 2021, what's contemplated in updated guidance versus your initial expectations for Safe Harbor?\nKaren Dearing: Overall, the marina portfolio has been outperforming our initial underwriting. Annual and transient boat slip and storage rents have been outperforming, service NOIs have been outperforming. I think there's a little offset for utility expenses and some payroll and incentive costs in the marina portfolio. But our guidance into the end of the year does include some amount of outperformance and certainly the impact of the acquisitions that the marina – that we've done in the marina portfolio.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. Can you quantify the outperformance?\nGary Shiffman: I think we have broken out. Hey, I think John…\nNicholas Joseph: You might guys move closer to the microphone. It's very hard to hear you.\nGary Shiffman: Yes, sure. We are having a little bit of audio difficulties on Sun's end today. So I apologize for those as we got started at the beginning of the meeting. Can you hear me okay now?\nNicholas Joseph: Yes, a little bit better. You must be on a boat at Safe Harbor.\nGary Shiffman: I wish I could tell you I was floating up and down on the waves. But we are here in Southfield, Michigan, doing what we always do. I think we don't have it broken up out. You could follow up and discuss a little bit more with Karen. But the best thing that we can point to is that we're getting those strong third quarter results as compared to 2019 of 9.9% growth in CAGR and year-to-date 8.5%. And as Karen indicated, the demand for wet slips and dry slips similar to RV with boat sales increasing, especially the large boat sales year-over-year at the highest level from what I understand that they've been. Just more and more demand and at the end of this month, we'll mark the 12-month, one-year period of times since we closed on the transaction with Safe Harbor. As we've indicated, it is outperforming our initial underwriting, but we're also very pleased that the acquisitions once put on the Safe Harbor operating platform have been outperforming or underwriting there as well. So we do experience in the marina side exactly what we're experiencing in MH and RV and have been for the last 20 plus years. Once put on a very professional best-in-class platform as they have at Safe Harbor, we are extracting greater returns than initially underwritten. So same kind of outperformance.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then what's your appetite for additional marina international expansion, and can you talk through the strategic rationale of any additional acquisitions there?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. Nick, I think we've shared it on our calls before. We will be looking at a few points of international marina acquisitions. The benefit and in part a lot of what we're seeing with the outperformance relates to the strategic footprint and networking that the Safe Harbor management team has been able to design. I talked about it in my remarks. You can start in Maine today, even a little north of Maine being a Safe Harbor marina and travel all the way down to the Caribbean staying in the network. Now what we'd like to do is be able to keep that network Trans-Atlantic, if you will, and we will look for a couple of points where our larger vessels in particular who had to one side of the ocean for half of the year, and the other side of the Atlantic for the other half of the year and stay in the Safe Harbor network. So nothing to share on that yet, but we are working diligently to find a couple of points at Trans-Atlantic.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keegan Carl with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.\nKeegan Carl: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, just a little bit more color on the same community RV NOI growth. I guess how much of it was a function of volume versus pricing? And then on the labor side of things, do you think your NOI was actually improved by the current labor shortage?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. This is John. So in the quarter, we saw about a 15 – a little bit over 15% increase on the rate side and about 8% increase in occupancy. So that's kind of the splits for that. What was the second question? I'm sorry, I missed that.\nKeegan Carl: Yes. On labor, so do you guys think it actually was a tailwind for NOI growth just given there's a current labor shortage and you probably have less people working than anticipated?\nJohn McLaren: No. I mean, we just like everybody else, we had a little bit of shortage, particularly at the beginning of the season with our seasonal help that we have at the communities, but nothing much significant.\nKeegan Carl: Okay.\nGary Shiffman: I think one of the things that we discussed on our last call with regard to that, any savings we might have had from the shortage of people was really eroded by how we took up our wages at that level. And when you increase them to attract new personnel, you've also got to raise your existing personnel up to those new higher wages. And that was started to be incorporated first and second quarter and actually is in our guidance through the end of the year, and we expect to incorporated into 2022.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And then on marinas. Can you give us a little additional color on the reconfiguration of certain assets? What are the typical costs associated with this and how long does it take to transform? What goes into determining what specific locations are best for it? And as it's completed, how much revenue uplift do you anticipate on it removing smaller slips, adding larger ones?\nGary Shiffman: Is that specifically to marinas or is that to all of our platforms?\nKeegan Carl: Yes. Specifically to marinas.\nGary Shiffman: It's Gary. And well, I don't have those specific numbers for you. I can share that we look to get low double-digit 12%, 13%, 14% returns on the capital invested for that type of repositioning. Average length of time to combine the docks and perhaps make them more efficient for the larger boats is approximately 12 months. That can be longer if permitting slows things down, certainly can be in the COVID environment. But it is a big part of the long-term plan just as it is in the MH and RV world will not only reconfigure MH and RV sites, but oftentimes if the zoning and entitlement is there, well it's great to ground just to the beginning and build the community up all over again. That's not the case with marinas, it's mostly just reconfiguring the slip sizes.\nKeegan Carl: Great. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Hope everyone's doing well. I saw that the number of rental homes over the quarter dropped, it seem to drop a fair bit. Was that driven by the asset sales you did or just higher conversions throughout the quarter?\nKaren Dearing: Hi, Josh. You picked both of the reasons. So you're seeing the impact of the dispositions of those six properties. Within them, there was about 625 rental homes, and on a year-over-year basis, we converted about 200 more rental homes to owner-occupied, and so both of those things are impacting the rental program.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Awesome. And then curious on the marina front, any new initiatives on that side of the business for 2022. I know this year, you launched Regatta in August in Newport. Is there a possibility to kind of expand that to other markets? And then also I'd love to hear just an update on how that went.\nGary Shiffman: Just missed the beginning of it with regard to marina new initiatives was – what was the beginning of the question?\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Just curious on if there are any new initiatives on the marina front for 2022?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. I think, I wouldn't reference any of them as new, I would say the continuation of just a very unique opportunity to roll up the best of the best. I mean, when you look at the quality of management and quality of the existing marinas, the focus is really membership and networks, so that we can keep all of the Safe Harbor members within the Safe Harbor network. So it's really about the geographic footprint. As I mentioned earlier, north to south, east to west. When we get into the inland lakes, the ability oftentimes to travel for one of the oceans from one of the inland lakes to the St. Lawrence Seaway things like that. So that network remains very, very important. The usage again – security is for Sun is opening up a lot of doors with regard to the longstanding relationships the Safe Harbor management team has with mom-and-pop owners for state planning and tax planning have not been able to sell even though they might like to. So I think that you'll continue to see a lot of the same, but we'll have the ability to be enormously selective and really acquire only the – what we refer to as the best of the best as we build out the platform going forward. So we remain enormously excited about the opportunity here. Again, I touched on already, it's the same ability to be able to harness accelerated growth by acquiring a marina and putting it on the Safe Harbor platform, applying the management skills, the economies of scale, the technology. So a very, very exciting place. I'd also add what was really interesting to realize that even after almost $1 billion of acquisition since we've acquired Safe Harbor less than a year ago, percentage rental revenue today 18% to 19% is exactly where it was when we acquired the platform, and just indicates continued opportunity within the MH and RV platform as well. So we're one year out. We're really pleased of what we see.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Awesome. Thanks, Gary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nWesley Golladay: Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just had a follow-up on the Safe Harbor and the marina acquisitions. At this point, how much of your targeted marina network do you have today?\nGary Shiffman: It's great question, Wes. We also shared with the market when we acquired the Safe Harbor platform. We had a approach that said we would look to take percentage of rental revenues up to perhaps 24%, 25% of the entire portfolio. As I indicated, we're currently still at 18%, 19% with $1 billion of acquisitions. So we really have our bright opportunity. We've shared the cap rates being 200 to 300 basis points greater than MH and RV, in some cases more. The great benefit of the network effect, the relationships from the founders, the builders and the patriarchs at Safe Harbor, the Brewer family is one we often refer to their networking effect. So we really do have a really bright future ahead of us with regard to potential acquisitions. So we really expect to be discipline. We're probably selectively acquiring above 20% of what's being reviewed, so really a lot of headroom to go moving forward.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then I guess when we look at the footprint of Safe Harbor, it looks like the West Coast is where your lightest. Is that going to be a little bit harder to buildup?\nGary Shiffman: I would suggest everything seems to be a little bit more expensive on the West Coast. So there's no doubt about that. But we carefully are focused on where the greatest growth out sales and slip demand is that will lead to the greatest value creation for our stakeholders. So we are working on the West Coast, but I would suggest very selectively, a lot more demand on the east side of the country right now than the west side.\nWesley Golladay: Got it. And then if I can switch gears real quick to Campspot. Can you update us on how many third party sites are now affiliated with the application? And then what were bookings for the platform in the third quarter?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. I can tell you, we've got – on the reservation side, we've got over a thousand folks that are using that system throughout the RV universe.\nGary Shiffman: I don't think we have any more updated information at this time other than we're extraordinarily excited about what's taken place there. And the fact is that a new CEO has been put in place and we're really excited about the opportunity in front of us with Campspot.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. Thanks everyone.\nGary Shiffman: There's nothing like it out there in the RV world right now. So it's the first of its kind.\nWesley Golladay: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thank you. John or Karen, could you provide a breakdown of the major expense line items that drove the 14% growth in the quarter, and just give us a sense for how long we should expect double-digit expense growth to continue?\nKaren Dearing: Sure, John. I'll break it down between manufactured housing and RV. So MH expenses were higher notably in payroll, obviously due to the proactive wage increases that we discussed last quarter, the supply and repair expense. I believe the comparable period in 2020 was low. I don't think we’re up to full operations last quarter, so that growth would be higher. Finally, we had higher than expected real estate tax assessments. Florida TRIM notices came in and they – we had some significant assessment increases, Texas had some also. Although we're appealing a number of those assessments, the third quarter really reflects the cumulative nine months impact of those higher assessments. So that's MH. RV variable expenses were up due to really the higher transient activity, things like supply and repair, vacation rental expense utilities that's really based on just the higher transient activity, and it also was impacted by the wage increase that we discussed. I think, as you think about what we are implying for fourth quarter, same community growth, I think you're looking at – with that 7.2% to 8% NOI growth, you're looking at revenues in the 7% to 7.8% in OpEx and maybe 6.7% to 7.5% range.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And just in terms of what's going on right now in the labor market and your proactive stance in increasing wages and then repair and maintenance. Can you just help us bracket reasonable best and worst case scenarios for expense growth over next year? Just help us understand what kind of inning we're in on the labor side and the repair and maintenance and the pressure on expense growth?\nKaren Dearing: Yes. That is kind of tough one to put – we don't really have any – we don't have guidance out for next year. So it's tough to give you specifics on that. I would think that with the wage increase that we did put in place that proactive wage increase, you see something that was pretty standard for wage increases. I think that – if you just think about expenses overall and potential inflation impacts since we already did wages, we've got, let's say, we're in the process of renewing our property insurance right now. So we'll have a better idea on pricing, very near-term. We already talked about real estate taxes and how dependent they are on assessments and we hope successful appeals. So that leads the supply and repair expenses that have that potential inflationary pressure no different than any other company, any operating business. And supply and repairs are about 12% to 13% of our OpEx. So I think that's as much color as I can provide you on something for next year.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Understand. But the payroll, the increases to payroll costs are those largely done now or should we expect another batch of large increases next year?\nKaren Dearing: Well, because we put them in, in the third and fourth quarter, we expected the whole impact to be about $16 million. And so we would have anticipated $8 million that would hit next year.\nGary Shiffman: For the total year.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Last one for me. John, could you just provide some color on how you're approaching the rental rate settings for MH renewal increases that you'll be sending out these next few months?\nJohn McLaren: Sure. As you know, John, we take a very long-term approach virtually with everything we do. It's our continued reinvestment into the communities, as well as the predictability of our rent increases is a big part of the reason why our residents live in our communities an average of 14 years. And as you probably know, this really saves on the cost of turnover, which is not much in any given year. But it's really sort of a balancing act, as I might have shared before. And I think it's important to remember that rate increase is just one of the growth levers that we have. Certainly occupancy growth is a big piece. As we've seen over the years, it’s important to maintain resident equity in their homes and improve it to that actually helps our home pricing and margins at the same time and see growth there. We are keenly focused on the social responsibility side of things with the rent increase, as we've shared before, especially, hopefully the later stages of COVID. But really it’s about consistency across all of our stakeholders and the kind of performance that we've had over the last 20 years in our NOI has been very consistent. And so I think last year we finished out at about a 3.4% weighted average increase that we had. And I think I said in my remarks that we're at 3.7% for this year. So we're seeing that expand a bit. But once again, I'm not really in a position to really guide to anything in 2022 at this time. But I think you can see sort of the trajectory of where it's moving.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. That helps. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. You mentioned that you're making good progress in converting transient RV sites to annual and that's helping you on the pricing side on the transient RV spaces. How do you balance pricing versus getting more new customers interested in RVing and what's the optimal mix between annual and transient sites in any given RV community?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. Good question. I think the way that to answer your question is first off, is back to what we've seen in the RV portfolio overall. I mean, all the performance indicators continue supporting that transient RV and RV overall is stronger than ever. There's a lot to unpack with that, vacations continue to be drawn to the outdoors even as air travels opened up over the course of this year. We look at internally just kind of going through the numbers again, we saw over 30% growth in transient RV NOI in the quarter, 50.2% RV annual revenue growth and those 1,500 conversions over the last 12 months that you're referring to. And one of the drivers is that has been – we've had over 143,000 new customers that stayed on Sun RV resort in the first three quarters of 2021. Our web-based traffic is up another 10% from historical high from last year. And a lot of increase in guests that are younger ages 18 to 24 and the 25 to 34 buckets. And then everything we're doing on social media with 1.4 million followers across the three major platforms that are out there. And so from the balance perspective, it's really going to be determined based on the function of a resort. And even within a resort, it's going to be the function of how much revenue is being derived by a single site within the resort. Certainly, if we're getting, let's just say $20,000 of revenue annually on a site that would have, if we converted it to an annual and it's getting 15, that's not a conversion that we would do. But in sites that are having lower revenue, we are converting those sites first, and it's really sort of that optimal mix, but it's really on a per community per resort basis versus then looking at something sort of overarching across the portfolio. \nAnthony Powell: Got it. And how do you replenish those loss transient sites once you convert them? Is there a way for you to do that?\nJohn McLaren: Can you say that one more time?\nAnthony Powell: Well, how do you replenish a transit site that converted, if you want to I guess continue to attract new customers into those sites – into the community. So if you convert one transit site into annual, do you then aim to, I guess, add a new transient site elsewhere in that community?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. If it's possible, I mean, we look all over our portfolio and add expansions to our existing communities prevalent.\nGary Shiffman: I don't think we look at it on a community-by-community basis, but more on a portfolio-wide basis. So two things happened. We look for transient opportunities in the acquisition pipeline where John and his team can convert as we've shared – when we do convert a transient to annual, the first year pickup in revenue is approximately 50% on that site. So acquisitions – team members will be guided when we want to focus on RV transient and when we want to shut it off from the acquisitions period of time. Right now, 1,500 sites for the first three quarters is the highest level of conversions that we've seen. So probably see us reduce naturally the amount of transient by the conversions. And then at that time, we would seek to acquire more property so we can have that conversion opportunity. And then as John mentioned, the expansion, finding the ground adjacent or oftentimes being able to acquire RV communities that have expansion opportunity as we did this last quarter is what we'd focus on to replenish it.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Maybe one more for me. The home sales numbers have been very strong. Is this kind of a new run rate of home sales for you or can you grow further? And is there any kind of one-time bump in home sales given just all the increased demand due to COVID dislocation migration? Any color there would be great.\nJohn McLaren: I think it's a run rate we can expect and maybe with a little bit more growth in front of it too. So I mean that's what we aim for each year. It's just some incremental pickup in terms of quant’s price and margin. And then really on the price and the margin side, it's really got a lot to do with all of it, frankly, is once again, it speaks to the high quality of the communities and the demand that's out there for affordable housing and that's what we offer. So I'd expect it to grow a little bit.\nGary Shiffman: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Anthony, where we – one of the restrictors is vacancy. So we build expansion sites so that we can fill them up and sell homes. And then secondly, in our acquisition strategy, which we've shared over the last 15 plus years, being able to buy vacancy within an existing community is really very accretive for us. Four Leaf Portfolio that we closed on this quarter is a great example of that. We have the opportunity as a well capitalized and experienced manager to take the opportunity of those vacancies and accelerate the sales and the occupancy and enhance early growth in those properties. So those kinds of opportunities are really something we'd like to focus on.\nJohn McLaren: And then I'd also just add, and properties that have a higher occupancy, we're seeing nice growth in our broker residents – resident resale transactions, and picking up sales to that vehicle as well.\nAnthony Powell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Acquisitions this quarter seem to be a little bit more tilted towards properties with development opportunities or land that can be developed. Is that a conscious effort or maybe a reflection of the returns you can get from development relative to matured properties?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. Absolutely. I mean it’s – we like the combination of all of it. Acquiring operating assets are accretive that we can expand the yield on as well as ones like Gary was just talking about where those vacancy upside to pick up through occupancy gains. That is exactly in our wheelhouse and something that we've demonstrated for many years that we're very good at.\nMichael Goldsmith: Do you think that becomes a bigger part of the growth algorithm going forward?\nJohn McLaren: Yes.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's helpful. And building off a prior question, as you have your conversations with communities for the upcoming year, you said – you kind of mentioned that rate growth had kind of accelerated from last year and it could look to pick up a little bit more. How does that breakout between all age communities and age restricted communities. And then separately, are these communities, are they asking for new or different amenities in a post COVID world?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. I think, I mean, typically you're going to see – on average, you're going to see a higher increase in all age community than you do in age restricted community. As far as the addition of amenities as part of that process, that's something from a capital improvement standpoint. And again, the long-term perspective that we have is just a continual thing for us anyway. And it's not really a trade as much as – it's just what we do, okay, continue to keep the communities beautiful so that we can grow them with all the different levers that we have.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Gary Shiffman for closing remarks.\nGary Shiffman: Well, I'll apologize for any audio difficulties today. We're certainly going to look into this new system we installed. We thank everybody for participating. This is a management team that is as excited as ever to be able to continue to grow the portfolio to meet the stakeholders’ expectations. And we look forward to reporting fourth quarter and year-end results. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

            "content": "Thanks, John. For the third quarter, Sun reported core FFO per share of $2.11, 31.9% above the prior year and $0.05 ahead of the top-end of our third quarter guidance range. Outperformance was achieved across annual and transient RV and marinas. During and subsequent to the quarter end, we acquired approximately $500 million of operating properties, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.1 billion, adding 38 properties, totaling nearly 12,000 sites. To support our operations and grow expectations, we have been active in enhancing our balance sheet and in capital markets activity, which provide the capacity and flexibility to pursue our ongoing growth pipeline. Last quarter, we received investment grade ratings, which provides us with an additional attractive source of financing. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes and our second bond offering of the year across seven and 10-year maturities. Additionally, we utilized our ATM program and completed the sale of 21.4 million of forward shares of common stock. We ended the second quarter with $4.7 billion of debt outstanding at a 3.3% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 9.6 years. As of September 30, we had $72 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio of 4.9x. We are raising our full-year 2021 core FFO guidance to a range of $6.44 to $6.50 per share, a $0.16 increase at the midpoint from our prior range. The increase includes our outperformance in the third quarter with the remainder due to contributions from recent acquisitions and increased expectations across each of our businesses. We expect core FFO for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.30 per share. We are also increasing full-year same community NOI growth guidance to a range of 10.9% to 11.1%, up 70 basis points from the previous midpoint of guidance of 10.3%. The fourth quarter same community NOI growth guidance is 7.2% to 8%. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which maybe included in research analyst estimates. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for questions. Operator? Overall, the marina portfolio has been outperforming our initial underwriting. Annual and transient boat slip and storage rents have been outperforming, service NOIs have been outperforming. I think there's a little offset for utility expenses and some payroll and incentive costs in the marina portfolio. But our guidance into the end of the year does include some amount of outperformance and certainly the impact of the acquisitions that the marina – that we've done in the marina portfolio. Hi, Josh. You picked both of the reasons. So you're seeing the impact of the dispositions of those six properties. Within them, there was about 625 rental homes, and on a year-over-year basis, we converted about 200 more rental homes to owner-occupied, and so both of those things are impacting the rental program. Sure, John. I'll break it down between manufactured housing and RV.

Yes. That is kind of tough one to put – we don't really have any – we don't have guidance out for next year. So it's tough to give you specifics on that.

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our third quarter 2021 results. Strong third quarter is a continuation of the momentum we have historically demonstrated, which reflects both the stability and the growth potential of a platform we have established. This includes organic growth, expansions and developments and acquisitions. The combination of these elements allowed us to deliver 31.9% growth in core FFO per share during the third quarter and exceeded the high end of our guidance. This beat, along with a positive outlook for the remainder of the year once again, led us to raise our core 2021 FFO guidance by $0.16 at the midpoint for a range of $6.44 to $6.50 per share and are expected the same community NOI growth for the full-year at 70 basis points for a range of 10.9% to 11.1%. For the quarter, same community NOI grew 12.4% over last year, driven by our favorable strategic positioning to capture the sustained demand in RVs. In our RV segment, same community NOI increased by 30.6% for the quarter as transient RV continued to deliver exceptionally strong results. Our RV Resort business is benefiting from people seeking outdoor experiences at Sun RV resorts coming from both existing and new customers. RVing is establishing itself as the vacation choice for many travelers, and we have positioned the Sun to capture this demand at scale. We are continuing to see momentum in forward bookings for transient as well as annual site conversions. Furthermore, the opening of the Canadian border in November is expected to accelerate that momentum in the first quarter of next year as we welcome back our Canadian Snowbird residents and guests. The stability of our manufactured housing portfolio continues to show the need for attainable housing as evidenced by our home sales volume and applications to live in a Sun community. Manufactured home sales were another bright spot in the quarter. The total home sales volume up nearly 64% from the prior year and brokered home sales up over 15% for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2020. Our core pillars of delivering superior customer service, maintaining high quality communities and offering an attainable housing option continue to create strong demand to live in a Sun community. In our Marina segment, we are pleased that results continue to track ahead of our underwriting. Our NOI increases this quarter [indiscernible] primarily from the continued demand for wet slips and dry storage needs for our members. Forward demand for dry storage and wet slip rental is ahead of where they were at this time last year in large part through our best-in-class marina network, locations and services. We have also remained active in growing and improving our portfolio. In the third quarter and through the date of this earnings call, we added 22 properties across our three segments deploying over $500 million of capital and adding over 7,400 sites. Our recently acquired Four Leaf Portfolio of nine manufactured housing communities in the Midwest comprises over 2,500 high quality sites with expansion growth opportunities and ample room to fill existing vacancies. On the marina side, our acquisitions of Puerto del Rey in Puerto Rico, the largest marina in the Caribbean continues to strengthen our irreplaceable network of marina assets. Puerto del Rey now allows for a Safe Harbor member to remain within the network while traveling from the Northeast all the way down to the Caribbean. Our acquisition teams remain extremely active and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities we are seeing across each of Sun's business segments. Furthermore, we have a proven track record of maximizing value from our acquisitions as we integrate them on to the Sun platform. This includes adding value through our operational platform, proprietary technologies, the scale of our marketing and booking platforms, including Campspot and potential repositioning of acquired properties. As the leading industry consolidator, we believe our cycle tested ability to create value through acquisitions will continue to result in attractive accretive growth. This activity is supported by the ongoing proactive focus and maintaining financial flexibility. Additionally, we are continually evaluating our portfolio for assets which no longer fit with our long-term strategic and growth objectives. To that end, in the third quarter, we completed the disposition of six assets for a total sales price of $162 million, representing a blended cap rate of low 4s, which further demonstrates the value of Sun's portfolio. We have a deep bench of incredibly talented team members, a well-positioned balance sheet, and a healthy pipeline of internal and external growth opportunities and we remain optimistic in our ability to deliver on each of our performance objectives. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational performance. John? I think we have broken out. Hey, I think John... Yes, sure. We are having a little bit of audio difficulties on Sun's end today. So I apologize for those as we got started at the beginning of the meeting. Can you hear me okay now? I wish I could tell you I was floating up and down on the waves. But we are here in Southfield, Michigan, doing what we always do. I think we don't have it broken up out. You could follow up and discuss a little bit more with Karen. But the best thing that we can point to is that we're getting those strong third quarter results as compared to 2019 of 9.9% growth in CAGR and year-to-date 8.5%. And as Karen indicated, the demand for wet slips and dry slips similar to RV with boat sales increasing, especially the large boat sales year-over-year at the highest level from what I understand that they've been. Just more and more demand and at the end of this month, we'll mark the 12-month, one-year period of times since we closed on the transaction with Safe Harbor. As we've indicated, it is outperforming our initial underwriting, but we're also very pleased that the acquisitions once put on the Safe Harbor operating platform have been outperforming or underwriting there as well. So we do experience in the marina side exactly what we're experiencing in MH and RV and have been for the last 20 plus years. Once put on a very professional best-in-class platform as they have at Safe Harbor, we are extracting greater returns than initially underwritten. So same kind of outperformance. Yes. Nick, I think we've shared it on our calls before. We will be looking at a few points of international marina acquisitions. The benefit and in part a lot of what we're seeing with the outperformance relates to the strategic footprint and networking that the Safe Harbor management team has been able to design. I talked about it in my remarks. You can start in Maine today, even a little north of Maine being a Safe Harbor marina and travel all the way down to the Caribbean staying in the network. Now what we'd like to do is be able to keep that network Trans-Atlantic, if you will, and we will look for a couple of points where our larger vessels in particular who had to one side of the ocean for half of the year, and the other side of the Atlantic for the other half of the year and stay in the Safe Harbor network. So nothing to share on that yet, but we are working diligently to find a couple of points at Trans-Atlantic. I think one of the things that we discussed on our last call with regard to that, any savings we might have had from the shortage of people was really eroded by how we took up our wages at that level. And when you increase them to attract new personnel, you've also got to raise your existing personnel up to those new higher wages. And that was started to be incorporated first and second quarter and actually is in our guidance through the end of the year, and we expect to incorporated into 2022. Is that specifically to marinas or is that to all of our platforms? It's Gary. And well, I don't have those specific numbers for you. I can share that we look to get low double-digit 12%, 13%, 14% returns on the capital invested for that type of repositioning. Average length of time to combine the docks and perhaps make them more efficient for the larger boats is approximately 12 months. That can be longer if permitting slows things down, certainly can be in the COVID environment. But it is a big part of the long-term plan just as it is in the MH and RV world will not only reconfigure MH and RV sites, but oftentimes if the zoning and entitlement is there, well it's great to ground just to the beginning and build the community up all over again. That's not the case with marinas, it's mostly just reconfiguring the slip sizes. Just missed the beginning of it with regard to marina new initiatives was – what was the beginning of the question? Yes. I think, I wouldn't reference any of them as new, I would say the continuation of just a very unique opportunity to roll up the best of the best. I mean, when you look at the quality of management and quality of the existing marinas, the focus is really membership and networks, so that we can keep all of the Safe Harbor members within the Safe Harbor network. So it's really about the geographic footprint. As I mentioned earlier, north to south, east to west. When we get into the inland lakes, the ability oftentimes to travel for one of the oceans from one of the inland lakes to the St. Lawrence Seaway things like that. So that network remains very, very important. The usage again – security is for Sun is opening up a lot of doors with regard to the longstanding relationships the Safe Harbor management team has with mom-and-pop owners for state planning and tax planning have not been able to sell even though they might like to. So I think that you'll continue to see a lot of the same, but we'll have the ability to be enormously selective and really acquire only the – what we refer to as the best of the best as we build out the platform going forward. So we remain enormously excited about the opportunity here. Again, I touched on already, it's the same ability to be able to harness accelerated growth by acquiring a marina and putting it on the Safe Harbor platform, applying the management skills, the economies of scale, the technology. So a very, very exciting place. I'd also add what was really interesting to realize that even after almost $1 billion of acquisition since we've acquired Safe Harbor less than a year ago, percentage rental revenue today 18% to 19% is exactly where it was when we acquired the platform, and just indicates continued opportunity within the MH and RV platform as well. So we're one year out. We're really pleased of what we see. It's great question, Wes. We also shared with the market when we acquired the Safe Harbor platform. We had a approach that said we would look to take percentage of rental revenues up to perhaps 24%, 25% of the entire portfolio. As I indicated, we're currently still at 18%, 19% with $1 billion of acquisitions. So we really have our bright opportunity. We've shared the cap rates being 200 to 300 basis points greater than MH and RV, in some cases more. The great benefit of the network effect, the relationships from the founders, the builders and the patriarchs at Safe Harbor, the Brewer family is one we often refer to their networking effect. So we really do have a really bright future ahead of us with regard to potential acquisitions. So we really expect to be discipline. We're probably selectively acquiring above 20% of what's being reviewed, so really a lot of headroom to go moving forward. I would suggest everything seems to be a little bit more expensive on the West Coast. So there's no doubt about that. But we carefully are focused on where the greatest growth out sales and slip demand is that will lead to the greatest value creation for our stakeholders. So we are working on the West Coast, but I would suggest very selectively, a lot more demand on the east side of the country right now than the west side. I don't think we have any more updated information at this time other than we're extraordinarily excited about what's taken place there. And the fact is that a new CEO has been put in place and we're really excited about the opportunity in front of us with Campspot. There's nothing like it out there in the RV world right now. So it's the first of its kind. For the total year. I don't think we look at it on a community-by-community basis, but more on a portfolio-wide basis. So two things happened. We look for transient opportunities in the acquisition pipeline where John and his team can convert as we've shared – when we do convert a transient to annual, the first year pickup in revenue is approximately 50% on that site. So acquisitions – team members will be guided when we want to focus on RV transient and when we want to shut it off from the acquisitions period of time. Right now, 1,500 sites for the first three quarters is the highest level of conversions that we've seen. So probably see us reduce naturally the amount of transient by the conversions. And then at that time, we would seek to acquire more property so we can have that conversion opportunity. And then as John mentioned, the expansion, finding the ground adjacent or oftentimes being able to acquire RV communities that have expansion opportunity as we did this last quarter is what we'd focus on to replenish it. Yes. The only thing I'd add, Anthony, where we – one of the restrictors is vacancy. So we build expansion sites so that we can fill them up and sell homes. And then secondly, in our acquisition strategy, which we've shared over the last 15 plus years, being able to buy vacancy within an existing community is really very accretive for us. Four Leaf Portfolio that we closed on this quarter is a great example of that. We have the opportunity as a well capitalized and experienced manager to take the opportunity of those vacancies and accelerate the sales and the occupancy and enhance early growth in those properties. So those kinds of opportunities are really something we'd like to focus on. Well, I'll apologize for any audio difficulties today. We're certainly going to look into this new system we installed. We thank everybody for participating. This is a management team that is as excited as ever to be able to continue to grow the portfolio to meet the stakeholders' expectations. And we look forward to reporting fourth quarter and year-end results. Thank you, everybody."

            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Sun delivered a strong third quarter across the Board outperforming our previous expectations. Our results reflect the combination of the stability of our best-in-class portfolio, as well as the contributions from our growth initiatives across all three of our business segments. For the third quarter, combined same community manufactured housing and RV NOI increased 12.4% from the third quarter 2020. The growth in NOI was driven by a 12.8% revenue gain supported by a 150 basis point increase in occupancy to 98.9% and a 3.7% weighted average rental rate increase. Our expenses were up 13.7% from the prior year. Same community manufactured housing NOI increased by 2.6% from 2020 and same community RV NOI increased by 30.6%. Annual RV growth was 50.2% for the quarter as a result of a 5% rental rate increase and the effect of over 1,500 conversions to annual leases over the trailing 12 months. RV transient revenues were up 29% compared to last year. This is on top of the 5% transient growth we experienced in the third quarter of 2020 over 2019 when we began to see the benefits of travelers who were seeking drive-to vacation options and took advantage of our resorts and desirable destinations. When we issued second quarter results in late July, we shared the transient RV revenue for the second half of the year was 15.2% ahead of the original budget. Today and accounting for the third quarter's actual contribution, it has accelerated to 18.3% ahead of original budget. As of this earnings call, our fourth quarter transient RV revenue is 19.6% ahead of the original budget. The increased levels of consumer engagement discussed last quarter have continued. Year-to-date RV website traffic is up 10% compared to last year and 120% compared to 2019 and we have seen our social media following and interaction continue to grow with more than 1.4 million followers on the three major platforms, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Our best salespeople have always been our residents and guests and their reach to spread the word has been meaningfully amplified through our social media engagement. We have also continued to sign up members to our pilots and RV Resorts loyalty program. And while it's still in its early days, initial interest and feedback have been very positive. In short, we believe we are seeing strong evidence of two important trends. First, that many travelers are learning up and trying out an RV vacation, and second, once travelers have discovered their sunnier side through an RV vacation, it becomes part of their future vacation considerations. Additionally, Sun has simplified the reservation process with our Campspot platform, which in turn enhances the demand for RV vacation at Sun RV Resorts. With respect to our total MH and RV portfolio, we continue to pursue our strategy of filling existing vacancy and creating additional revenue producing opportunities through expansion and conversions. In the third quarter, we gained 576 revenue producing sites. Of our revenue producing site gains over 430 were transient RV sites converted to annual leases with the balance being added to our manufactured housing expansion communities. We have now converted almost 1,200 transient RV sites to annual leases year-to-date, which exceeds any prior full-year figure and demonstrates the successful execution of this internal growth lever. The RV site conversions resulted in an average 50% increase in site revenues during the first year of conversion with an additional benefit of transient site [indiscernible] rates. Moving on to new construction. In the third quarter, we delivered over 320 new sites, approximately 70% of which were Greenfield ground-up developments and the remainder were expansions to existing communities. One of the ground-up developments delivered this quarter was the next phase of Smith Creek Crossing, a manufactured housing community in Granby, Colorado. The first phase of 82 sites has been filling up rapidly since opening a year ago, and we anticipate this next phase to continue to see the high demand for attainable housing in the area. MH home sales in the third quarter were also strong. Total sales volume was up 64% year-over-year as we sold more than 1,100 homes in the quarter. These results are clear reflection of the value proposition that a Sun manufactured housing community offers the healthy demand for these homes and the home value that is maintained in our communities. Applications to live in a Sun community are up 13.2% year-to-date, and we anticipate we will continue to see strength in our manufactured housing business, given the tight housing market and the demand for quality attainable housing. Turning to the Marina business. We ended the quarter with 120 properties comprising nearly 45,000 wet slips and dry storage spaces, which includes the acquisition of six properties for approximately $250 million completed in the third quarter. Same marina rental revenue growth for the portfolio of 75 properties owned and operated by Safe Harbor since the start of 2019 was 17.8% for the nine months of 2021 over 2019. This is a CAGR increase in rental revenue of 9.9% for the quarter and 8.5% year-to-date through the end of September 2021. Better-than-expected performance for the Marina portfolio continues to come from demand for wet slips and dry storage spaces. We have also witnessed higher margins on the service business with Lauderdale Marine Center and Riva, which being the leading contributors to this outperformance. Great service creates stronger slip rental demand and higher member retention. In summary, Sun's growth engines continued to deliver strong results. Our internal levers are driven by the fundamentals of Sun's operating platform and by expansion site deliveries. Our total MH portfolio stands at approximately 97% occupancy, providing us with more than 200 basis points of occupancy upside as well as additional growth potential by adding further expansion sites over time. In the RV business, robust transient demand continues, and we also anticipate continued momentum and conversions of transient annual leases each year. We expect to build on our successful track record of delivering and filling expansion sites. We have an inventory of 7,500 expansion sites, portion of which we intend to strategically deliver each year targeting 10% to 14% unlevered IRRs. In addition, our external growth pipeline is robust across all three businesses with opportunities to continue to consolidate each industry as well as pursuing selective ground-up developments. We are pleased with our performance year-to-date, and we expect to continue delivering on our objectives. Karen will now discuss our financial results in more detail. Karen? Yes. This is John. So in the quarter, we saw about a 15 – a little bit over 15% increase on the rate side and about 8% increase in occupancy. So that's kind of the splits for that. What was the second question? I'm sorry, I missed that. No. I mean, we just like everybody else, we had a little bit of shortage, particularly at the beginning of the season with our seasonal help that we have at the communities, but nothing much significant. Yes. I can tell you, we've got – on the reservation side, we've got over a thousand folks that are using that system throughout the RV universe. Sure. As you know, John, we take a very long-term approach virtually with everything we do. It's our continued reinvestment into the communities, as well as the predictability of our rent increases is a big part of the reason why our residents live in our communities an average of 14 years. And as you probably know, this really saves on the cost of turnover, which is not much in any given year. But it's really sort of a balancing act, as I might have shared before. And I think it's important to remember that rate increase is just one of the growth levers that we have. Certainly occupancy growth is a big piece. As we've seen over the years, it's important to maintain resident equity in their homes and improve it to that actually helps our home pricing and margins at the same time and see growth there. We are keenly focused on the social responsibility side of things with the rent increase, as we've shared before, especially, hopefully the later stages of COVID. But really it's about consistency across all of our stakeholders and the kind of performance that we've had over the last 20 years in our NOI has been very consistent. And so I think last year we finished out at about a 3.4% weighted average increase that we had. And I think I said in my remarks that we're at 3.7% for this year. So we're seeing that expand a bit. But once again, I'm not really in a position to really guide to anything in 2022 at this time. But I think you can see sort of the trajectory of where it's moving. Yes. Good question. I think the way that to answer your question is first off, is back to what we've seen in the RV portfolio overall. I mean, all the performance indicators continue supporting that transient RV and RV overall is stronger than ever. There's a lot to unpack with that, vacations continue to be drawn to the outdoors even as air travels opened up over the course of this year. We look at internally just kind of going through the numbers again, we saw over 30% growth in transient RV NOI in the quarter, 50.2% RV annual revenue growth and those 1,500 conversions over the last 12 months that you're referring to. And one of the drivers is that has been – we've had over 143,000 new customers that stayed on Sun RV resort in the first three quarters of 2021. Our web-based traffic is up another 10% from historical high from last year. And a lot of increase in guests that are younger ages 18 to 24 and the 25 to 34 buckets. And then everything we're doing on social media with 1.4 million followers across the three major platforms that are out there. And so from the balance perspective, it's really going to be determined based on the function of a resort. And even within a resort, it's going to be the function of how much revenue is being derived by a single site within the resort. Certainly, if we're getting, let's just say $20,000 of revenue annually on a site that would have, if we converted it to an annual and it's getting 15, that's not a conversion that we would do. But in sites that are having lower revenue, we are converting those sites first, and it's really sort of that optimal mix, but it's really on a per community per resort basis versus then looking at something sort of overarching across the portfolio. Can you say that one more time? Yes. If it's possible, I mean, we look all over our portfolio and add expansions to our existing communities prevalent. I think it's a run rate we can expect and maybe with a little bit more growth in front of it too. So I mean that's what we aim for each year. It's just some incremental pickup in terms of quant's price and margin. And then really on the price and the margin side, it's really got a lot to do with all of it, frankly, is once again, it speaks to the high quality of the communities and the demand that's out there for affordable housing and that's what we offer. So I'd expect it to grow a little bit. And then I'd also just add, and properties that have a higher occupancy, we're seeing nice growth in our broker residents – resident resale transactions, and picking up sales to that vehicle as well. Yes. Absolutely. I mean it's – we like the combination of all of it. Acquiring operating assets are accretive that we can expand the yield on as well as ones like Gary was just talking about where those vacancy upside to pick up through occupancy gains. That is exactly in our wheelhouse and something that we've demonstrated for many years that we're very good at. Yes. Yes. I think, I mean, typically you're going to see – on average, you're going to see a higher increase in all age community than you do in age restricted community. As far as the addition of amenities as part of that process, that's something from a capital improvement standpoint. And again, the long-term perspective that we have is just a continual thing for us anyway. And it's not really a trade as much as – it's just what we do, okay, continue to keep the communities beautiful so that we can grow them with all the different levers that we have."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings. Thank you for joining us today for Sun Communities Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our second quarter 2021 results. We are pleased with the continued outstanding performance of all our business segments. In the second quarter, we delivered 61% growth in core FFO per share to $1.80 as compared to the second quarter of 2020, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $1.63 as our ongoing momentum accelerated beyond our forecasted expectations.  Comparing to a non-COVID impact quarter, our second quarter FFO per share was 53% greater than the second quarter of 2019. This outperformance, along with a positive outlook for the third and fourth quarters, once again, led us to raise our core 2021 FFO guidance range by $0.31 at the midpoint to $6.25 to $6.37 per share. The change is being driven by continued outperformance of Transient RV, Marinas, the sustained strength in our manufactured housing portfolio and our robust acquisition activity, particularly as we begin to realize the meaningful Marina industry consolidation opportunity. Complementing our operational performance was Sun's well-received inaugural unsecured bond issuance and following our investment-grade rating from S&P and Moody's. We issued $600 million of senior notes in an oversubscribed offering in mid-June.  Sun's access to the bond market provides us with enhanced financial flexibility to most efficiently match fund our investment activities. With a healthy pipeline of internal and external growth opportunities, we believe this was the right time for this step, and we'll look to continue enhancing our credit metrics over time for improved ratings.  For the quarter, same community NOI grew 21.6% over last year, reflecting the continued demand in each of our segments and our favorable strategic positioning to capture that demand. We entered the quarter with same community occupancy of 98.8%, a 160 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2020 with manufactured housing same community NOI growing by 5.4% and RV same community NOI growing by 85.1%. Year-to-date, we have filled more than 1,000 revenue-producing manufactured housing and annual RV sites and have delivered more than 580 ground-up and expansion sites that will continue providing the runway for growth over subsequent quarters.  New site deliveries are one of Sun's key levers that we anticipate continuing to contribute to a sustained growth profile and value creation. As of quarter end, we had approximately 9,400 sites available for development that we anticipate delivering over time. We have also remained active in growing our portfolio, adding 18 properties in the second quarter and through this earnings call, deploying over $719 million of capital and adding more than 5,000 sites wet slips and dry storage spaces. This brings year-to-date acquisition volume to over $853 million across 28 properties.  Our acquisition teams remain extremely active, sourcing deals and channeling them through our underwriting process. We are very enthusiastic about the opportunities we are seeing across each of Sun's businesses. Our excellent reputation as a transaction partner and our structuring flexibility gives us access to off-market transactions across manufactured housing communities, RV resorts and marinas. Subsequent to quarter-end, we completed the disposition of 2 manufactured housing assets that no longer fit our core strategy. We sold these assets at a 4.3% cap rate, which we believe is a very positive indicator of the value and quality of our core portfolio.  Our RV resort business is benefiting from the demand for outdoor experiences. As we have been discussing throughout the pandemic, once travel restrictions began to lift, RV travel quickly emerged as a vacation option of choice. Importantly, even as broader travel has picked up, it is clear that people who have experienced the benefits of RV travel and the quality and amenities that Sun Resorts offer are becoming repeat customers. There has been no waning of demand for RV vacationing even as other forms of leisure travel have become available and bounce back. As John will discuss, we are confident this segment will remain strong for several reasons, including our solid forward bookings for transient and our annual site conversions.  In our marina business, results continue to track ahead of underwriting, and we are in the midst of an active boating season.  In summary, we are pleased with our results and optimistic about our outlook. We continue to achieve strong operational results and realize internal and external growth opportunities. Furthermore, with our equity raised in the first quarter and our recent bond issuance, we are well positioned to execute on each of these prospects.  Finally, I want to take a moment to recognize and thank the entire Sun team for their unwavering hard work and dedication. Our team members are the reason we continue to deliver the type of outperformance we have been discussing. We believe that one element of that success is our commitment to ESG matters, which are becoming increasingly woven into all aspects of our business.  As part of that enhanced focus, there is one element I wanted to highlight today. We are proactively adjusting our pay structure at the property level to ensure that pay is properly aligned with a number of factors, including job responsibilities, tenure service and appropriate living wages. While this is resulting in a payroll expense increase, we are committed to making Sun the best employer, which will facilitate us continuing to foster a dedicated, skilled and healthy team.  I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational performance. John?\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. Sun delivered a strong second quarter across the board, outperforming our prior expectations in RV, marinas and manufactured housing. Our results reflect the combination of the stability of our best-in-class portfolio as well as the incremental benefits of our growth initiatives across our 3 business lines.  For the second quarter, combined same community manufactured housing and RV NOI increased 21.6% from the second quarter 2020. The growth in NOI was driven by a 22.5% revenue gain, supported by a 160 basis point increase in occupancy to 98.8% and a 3.3% weighted average rent increase. This was offset by a 24.7% expense increase compared to the second quarter of last year when we had implemented expense saving measures, including furloughs of properties impacted by COVID-related closures. Same community manufactured housing NOI increased by 5.4% from 2020 and same-community RV NOI increased by 85.1%. The RV growth reflects both the impact from COVID-related delayed opening of 44 of our resorts on last year's results as well as the incredibly strong transient demand this year. Given the stay at home orders that were in place during the second quarter of 2020, we think it is helpful to look at these results relative to the second quarter of 2019.  For all of our comparisons to 2019, we are utilizing last year's same community pool of 367 communities. Compared to 2019, the portfolio's NOI CAGR was 9.7%, and the CAGR for revenues and expenses were 8.5% and 5.9%, respectively. The RV NOI CAGR was up by 18.6%, including a 19.6% increase in transient RV revenues. Looking at the most recent holiday weekends further illustrates how demand has escalated. For Memorial Day weekend, RV revenue was up 39% compared to 2019. Similarly, for the 4th of July weekend, revenue improved 35% compared to 2019 and 36.5% compared to 2020, driven by a 10.5% increase in occupancy and a 19% increase in average daily rate. We are pleased that so many new consumers have recently taken initial RV vacation. Moreover, we are confident that many of these vacationers have discovered the joy of RV travel and the quality outdoor experience at a Sun RV Resort. Therefore, even as other forms of travel have reopened or are deemed to be safe again, we are seeing demand persist through the second half of 2021.  I would like to highlight a few metrics which illustrate the increasing interest in Sun vacations and the engagement and loyalty of our guests. Traffic to our Sun RV Resorts website was incredibly strong in the first half of 2021, up almost 80% from the first half of 2020 and 158% compared to 2019. Within this growth, we are seeing a shift to a younger audience with significant increase in guests aged 18 to 34. Our social media efforts are attracting the largest following and engagement in the industry with over 1.3 million followers on 3 of the largest social media platforms, Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. A big element of a Sun vacation is the community and the activities we provide and these channels are in an ideal way to continue to showcase what we offer and to nurture community element to drive repeat guests.  From the same community perspective, first-time guests to our resorts increased 80% on during the first half of the year compared to 2019. We are also piloting a new RV resorts loyalty program where guests can earn points for stays and redeem them for benefits, discounts or free nights on future vacations. With the size of the Sun portfolio and the geographic variety we offer, we believe this program will further encourage guests to choose a Sun RV Resort as their vacation destination. As we look to the back half of the year, our transient forecast is trending 15.2% ahead of our original 2021 budget.  There are a number of dynamics supporting the continuation of these positive demand trends. One is a strong sale of new RVs. According to the RV Industry Association, 2021 RV unit sales are projected to be 34% higher than in 2020 and reached a new industry record. Additionally, there are a few promising venture-backed platforms, including RVShare and Outdoorsy, which allow owners to rent their personal RVs, providing a new option for consumers seeking an outdoor vacation without the capital outlay of buying an RV. These platforms help activate otherwise idle RVs, which we believe will fuel additional demand for RV Resorts.  With respect to the total MH & RV portfolio, in the second quarter, we gained 583 revenue-producing sites. Of our revenue-producing site gains over 350 transient RV sites were converted to annual leases, with the balance being added to our manufactured housing expansion communities. With the increase in RV guests, we're able to realize the opportunity to convert transient sites to annual leases and achieve an average 50% increase in site revenues during the first year of conversion.  Moving on to new construction. In the second quarter, we delivered approximately 220 new sites, 100 of which were ground-up developments and 120 were expansion sites. The ground-up development deliveries include RV sites at our newly opened camp Fimfo outside of Austin and Texas Hill country. This marks the first delivery in a planned series of new ground-up family-focused RV resorts within one of our JV partnerships. Those of you wondering, Fimfo stands for funs is more fun outdoors. These completed expansion and ground-up development sites will contribute to revenue growth in 2021 and beyond as they fill up and stabilize.  Manufactured housing home sales in the second quarter is another area where we saw a tremendous increase compared to the same period last year. Total sales volume was up approximately 90% year-over-year as we sold more than 1,100 homes in the quarter. Compared to 2019, this sales volume represents an increase of 25%. We believe the growth is due to a number of factors, including pent-up demand from limited home moves during the pandemic, the attainable nature of the homes in our communities in an increasingly tight real estate market, and lower relative increases for the construction and material costs of our product versus site-built housing.  Average home prices during the quarter for new and preowned homes rose 11.6% and 23.3%, respectively, underscoring the overall geographic mix as well as sustained demand for our product and the strong desire to live in a high-quality Sun community. This favorable demand environment helped support attractive gross margin results for both new and preowned home sales which expanded 50 basis points and 14.6 percentage points, respectively, compared to the prior year period. Additionally, brokered home sales volume was up 113% compared to the second quarter of 2020 with the average home value increasing by 26%.  In terms of our operations, in our manufactured housing business, we are benefiting from sustained strength and fundamentals and demand for affordable housing. Applications to live in a Sun Community were up more than 20% compared to 2020 in the second quarter and year-to-date.  Turning to the marina business. We ended the quarter with 114 properties comprising nearly 41,300 wet slips in dry storage spaces, which includes the acquisition of 4 properties for approximately $423 million completed in the second quarter. Better-than-expected performance for the marina portfolio continues to come from demand for wet slips and dry storage spaces. Same marina rental revenue growth for the portfolio of 75 properties owned and operated by safe harbor since the start of 2019 was almost 17% for the first half of 2021 over 2019. This is a CAGR increase in rental revenue of 9.7% for the quarter and 8% for the first half of 2021.  Overall, the marinas are performing ahead of expectations and the safe harbor team continues to source attractive acquisitions as Gary discussed. According to the National Marine Manufacturers industry, both dealers are seeing record levels of demand. New boat sales reached a 13-year high in 2020, and they remain at elevated levels with most recent reported sales data through March 2021, up 30% compared to the 2020 average.  In summary, we are very encouraged by our performance across all of our businesses year-to-date and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Secular demand trends are acting as a tailwind, and Sun has the platform and expertise to capture that demand and realize attractive growth. The combination of the favorable macro environment, along with the strategy Sun has been implementing for years, has positioned us very well to continue to execute on our initiatives, drive industry-leading growth and create long-term value for all stakeholders.  Karen will now discuss our financial results in more detail. Karen?\nKaren Dearing: Thanks, John. For the second quarter, Sun reported core FFO per share of $1.80, 60.7% above the prior year and $0.17 ahead of the top end of our second quarter guidance range.  Outperformance was achieved across all business lines. Our manufactured housing business experienced higher-than-forecasted revenue, including rental home revenue and other community-related fees and charges as well as lower-than-expected operating expenses.  Annual RV revenue as well as transient and vacation rental revenues drove strong results in the RV segment, partially offset by higher operating expenses including wages and benefits, utilities and supply and repair costs. And the marina business was bolstered by higher boat slip, storage and service revenues, offset by higher payroll costs as well as utility and repair costs.  During the quarter and subsequent to quarter-end, we acquired over $719 million of operating properties, bringing our year-to-date total to over $853 million, adding 28 properties totaling over 7,600 manufactured housing and RV sites, marina wet slips and dry storage spaces.  To support our operations and growth activities, we have been active in enhancing our balance sheet and in capital markets activity, which provide the capacity and flexibility to pursue our ongoing growth pipeline. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased to have received investment-grade ratings with stable outlooks from both S&P and Moody's. We followed this news with a successful $600 million inaugural bond offering in mid-June. Additionally, during the second quarter, we drew on the remainder of the forward equity sales agreement we had entered into in March. We settled 4 million shares with net proceeds of $540 million, the majority of which was used to fund our acquisitions and pay down our line of credit. Finally, we recast our revolving line of credit agreement. We replaced the prior $750 million line and safe harbor's prior $1.8 billion line with a combined $2 billion revolver with a $1 billion expansion option.  We ended the second quarter with $4.3 billion of debt outstanding at a 3.5% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 10.4 years. As of June 30, we had $104 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio of 5.1x.  We are raising our full year 2021 core FFO guidance to a range of $6.25 to $6.37 per share, a $0.31 increase at the midpoint from our prior range, which represents year-over-year growth of 24% at the midpoint. Approximately $0.17 of the increase is due to our outperformance in the second quarter with the remainder due to contributions from our recent acquisitions and increased expectations across each of our businesses, particularly transient RV. This is offset by approximately $8 million of property level proactive wage increases for the remainder of the year, which Gary previously discussed, of which approximately half had been included in prior issued guidance.  Additionally, we estimate an impact of $0.11 per share for the remainder of the year from the settlement of the forward equity offering completed in the second quarter. We expect core FFO for the third quarter to be in the range of $2 to $2.06 per share representing 27% year-over-year growth at the midpoint on top of the 10% growth we delivered in 2020 over 2019. We are also revising full year same community NOI growth guidance to a range of 9.9% to 10.7%, up 230 basis points from the previous midpoint of guidance of 8%. This revised NOI growth range is inclusive of the aforementioned increased property level payroll expenses. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates.  This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.\nNicholas Joseph: Gary, you mentioned the robust acquisition pipeline. So I'm wondering if you're seeing any differences in competition for assets or relative value between the different business lines?\nGary Shiffman: Nick, the competition stays pretty similar as to what we've expressed in the past. There are a number of newly formed platforms that we're encouvering out there, small to midsize looking to grow their portfolios. We announced the sale of 2 properties as dispositions in our earnings release that went to a group that is certainly growing their platform. Lots of competition out there in the MH, the RV side, and we're starting to see it a little bit on the marina side. Cap rates, although I know it wasn't part of your question, seemed pretty similar to where they've been and what we've shared in the past. The MH and RV all falling generally for us in the 4% to 5% cap rate range, and we're seeing them dip even sub-3% in some cases. So a lot of capital looking to acquire fewer and fewer available assets out there today.\nNicholas Joseph: That's helpful. And you mentioned the dispositions. How many more properties are noncore? And what should we expect you to sell into transaction market?\nGary Shiffman: I think that John would share these sentiments and feel free to add anything that we, from time-to-time, do a very close look at our assets and generally where we find assets that don't fit the growth pattern of the rest of the portfolio. We'll look at the potential disposition. You'd have to go back, I think, all the way to 2014 or '15 to the last dispositions that we do. I think in assembling best-in-class RV and MH platform over the last 10 years or so in the industry, they're is just a little bit of calling that will take place every so often when we don't meet those growth trajectories or have other reasons for selling assets.\nNicholas Joseph: Are there any more properties right now that aren't meeting those criteria that could be sold in the near term?\nGary Shiffman: There's a handful of fiber under properties that were identified on our disposition that may remain non-transact in the near future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Robert W. Baird.\nWesley Golladay: Just wondering with the strength you're seeing in the transient RV, does it make sense to hold back some of the annual RV sites at certain locations?\nJohn McLaren: Wes, this is John. Yes, I mean, reiterating some of the metrics that we shared in the prepared remarks, I mean, the traffic that we're seeing come into our community in terms of web traffic, the 80% increase in first-time guests versus 2019. I think one of the more sort of significant drivers that's contributing is we've talked a lot before about having 11 million registered RVs out there against about 1 million sites. But when you have platforms like Outdoorsy and RVShare, like I mentioned earlier, that really makes that number feel a lot higher than that. We don't know what it is. It could be 12 million, it could be 13 million as vital RVs are engaged throughout America. But -- so the activity is pretty incredible.  With that said, we have always been in that realm of 1,000 to 1,100 conversions that we would do. And one of the things that we do on a continual basis throughout the portfolio is look at each property on a site-by-site basis and kind of derive the right balance between revenue on a per site basis versus whether it remains a transient side or it becomes an annual site. And as you can see, we had still and we'll continue to grow the annual side of the business as well because we have converted over, I think, 744 year-to-date, which is actually tracking a little bit elevated from what we do on a normal year basis. So in a nutshell, it really is kind of a balance on a property-by-property basis, which we will be watching vigilantly as we always do for execution.\nWesley Golladay: Got it. And then when we look at the marinas, you obviously acquired another pretty fast clip here. Have you started to redevelop any of the sites that you've acquired already?\nGary Shiffman: Yes, it's Gary. Absolutely. There is a -- as we discussed a higher demand for bigger slips, longer slips as both being sold tend to be longer in length. So where we can convert smaller slips into those in higher demand, the longer slips that continually is taking place. Not-too-distant future, we will look to open a brand-new marina development, which strategically is directly across the river from the Lauderdale Marina that was just acquired. So we'll be able to expand that marina facility. So it's an ongoing process that Safe Harbor management has done very, very similar to Sun's MH and RV platform of studying the existing assets and creating value out of redeveloping and reinvesting capital where we can.\nWesley Golladay: Got it. And I just have one quick modeling question. You have that new metric, the SRDE. There's a lot of seasonality to it. Should we expect 3Q results to be largely comparable to 2Q?\nKaren Dearing: Yes. The Q3 results, as we've mentioned, are highly driven on transient RV and marina. So in the marina side, it's service really that's driving it. And on the RV side, it's retail dining, entertainment and other fees and charges. So I would expect continued outperformance from those areas in Q3.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Berenberg.\nKeegan Carl: I think just given all your recent transactions in the marina space, is there a percentage of the business that you actually cap marina revenues at? Or are you going to continue to be aggressive just given the attractive cap rates you're seeing?\nGary Shiffman: Keegan, I think what we shared when we acquired and announced the transaction with Safe Harbor that the Safe Harbor rental income would represent about -- at that time, it was about 17% of Sun's rental revenues. If you fast forward to today, even with all the acquisition that's taken place, it represents about 18% of our rental revenues. The goal initially shared with our stakeholders similar to what we did in the RV business. We grew our RV rental revenue from about 11% in the mid-2000s to about 25%, 30% to date. And we would be prepared at the time, my remarks were to go to 20% to 25% of rental revenue in marina. But as it happens, we've been very successful with the continued strong pipeline in the MH and RV side. So we moved the needle about 1 percentage point with all the marina acquisitions to date.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And then as far as the marina acquisition strategy, should we expect more yacht-focused marinas in the future? And how do the cap rates compare on these just to a traditional marina?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. Similar to real estate, it's all about location and demand in any given area. And I'd share a big picture that very similar to what we accomplished at Sun in RV and MH. We focused on the East Coast. we are very strong -- we're very strong in Florida as Safe Harbor has moved up the coast to the north all the way to Maine as Safe Harbor is doing to create a footprint that the members at Safe Harbor can travel within the system of Safe Harbor. We think that's true and a differentiator, if you will, from the strong platform the Safe Harbor has created and creating.  And then we will move to the West Coast, very similar to what we did in MH and RV. We've already begun our efforts there with several acquisitions on the West Coast, and we will look to create membership pattern and traffic up and down the West Coast as well from areas like Seattle all the way down to San Diego. And the goal, again, is to create a consistency and a quality of expectation throughout the Safe Harbor membership. So the goal is they actually will never want to stay anywhere but a Safe Harbor marina if we can provide the footprint for them to do so.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And just one final one on the investment-grade ratings that you guys received. Can you maybe go through the process you went through working with the ratings agencies? And was it ahead of your internal expectations to receive them?\nKaren Dearing: I'm sorry, could you ask the question again? Was it ahead of our internal ...\nGary Shiffman: Yes, we worked through it. I think it was, if anything, faster than we would have expected. When we made the decision, and it's something we review as part of our first quarter review with our Board of Directors and senior management, reviewing all things Sun, including the balance sheet. We determined that the timing seemed right and I think that all the work that's gone into Sun's balance sheet, its history and the fact it was investment-graded -- investment-grade rated prior to 2004 assisted in a very fast approval and the investment-grade rating that we saw. Our goal is to continue to work with the agencies and demonstrate a process that can improve the rating as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore.\nSamir Khanal: Gary, I guess my question is around the acquisition pipeline. I mean, you've been very active on that front. Looking at the numbers you could do more than $1 billion this year. Do you think that's sort of sustainable into even next year as we think about your growth profile over the next 12 to 24 months, just given the amount of capital chasing deals today? I just want to kind of get your view on that.\nGary Shiffman: It absolutely is a great question, Samir. Each year we're faced with that same question externally and internally. We've been very fortunate have a great acquisitions team, and now we have a great acquisition teams, if you will, [indiscernible]. The marina acquisition team at Safe Harbor has joined the company, along with our existing MH and RV team. It's getting harder and harder. There is more and more competition from small investors, as I said earlier, all the way to big platforms that are out there that are well capitalized. The 1031 exchange competition that's out there has made it more and more difficult. In general, one of the things that has succeeded -- helped us succeed in our acquisitions is the deep relationships, the deep history, the fact that we've been so acquisitive for the last 10-plus years.  So there really isn't a transaction that happens out there in the MH and RV space that Sun doesn't have an opportunity to take a look at or isn't brought to that transaction first. Some of them are off market, and that's where we've been very, very successful. They're not brokered. They come directly to us. And others, we're very competitive in the auctions with the brokers, but we're not chasing things that don't work for our growth pattern.  So the short answer is, it's becoming more and more difficult. I think we will continue to be successful. The view that we have in the pipeline right now is pretty similar as we've shared over the last few quarterly calls. We will look to continue to ramp up our new community development. I've indicated we've got about 8,400 sites currently under contract in various forms of either closing or entitlement and rezoning efforts and where we can build communities to high single-digit unlevered IRRs on stabilization. We will look to continue to ramp up that business over the next 3 to 5 years. And if we should fall short at all in the acquisition area, we think we'll more than make up for the growth on the new community development level.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Gary, Karen and John, I hope you're all well. Curious on the RV side. I know at NAREIT, we discussed the rollout of your Campspot RV revenue management system. How much of a contributor of that is driving the strength in transient RVs?\nJohn McLaren: Josh, it's John. It obviously is a significant contributor more than anything else with Campspot from the reservation process and the fact that the system itself has a built-in algorithm that adjust for the most efficient rate and occupancy equation helps kind of -- as I've described before, I mean, every time, every weekend that comes along every week in the portfolio, it's sort of like putting the jigsaw puzzle together. And so this maximizes that grid automatically within the system.  And that's just -- but that's just a piece of everything that's contributing on the RV side because it can also go the other way, which is from a revenue management standpoint, if we've got some lower occupancy weekdays, we can actually adjust the rates downward to fill more occupancy in the community. And so what we're able to do then just like we've done historically for years, Sun's had a significant focus on the shoulder months associated with our Snowbird season. Now we have sort of shoulder days associated with every week. And so we're seeing those contributions come in by moving up and down in terms of rate as well as the grid in the occupancy within a given community.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. No, that's great to see. And then if I look at Page 22 or sub, there's a column in the table called growth projects. I don't know if that's new or not, but I noticed it was 2019, it was a lot smaller than it was in 2020 and 2021. Curious if most of this -- most of these growth projects are being driven by the marinas?\nKaren Dearing: Well, Josh, you noticed this. It used to be called revenue producing. And when we brought the Marina portfolio and we changed it to growth projects. So you're correct. There is a piece of this is what these projects are or projects that are either revenue-producing or expense savings. So they include things like our solar project, other utility conservation projects. From the Safe Harbor side, it includes the slip configuration, the dry storage improvements and some of their water suite rental boats that they're including. So about $11-plus million of it is from the MH, RV side and the remainder of it is Safe Harbor.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.\nJohn Pawlowski: I just like to follow up on Josh's question there, John, I'd just like to hear how you think through the intermediate term trajectory of just total RV and net dollars? So you've got Campspot rolled out some of this transient demand will probably go away, but other sources of demand in a post-COVID world will stick. So will absolute RV dollars go down over the coming years? Will it go up? Just help me think through the stickiness of this demand you're seeing?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. Great question, John. I appreciate it. I mean I've got a whole bunch of metrics I can go through here, which is to say, you look at the growth we've had in RV same community NOI up 85% in the second quarter. If you look at the Memorial Day, the holiday revenue growth that we've had from Memorial Day and 4th of July up 39% and 35% versus 2019. You look at a really healthy split and how that growth has happened between occupancy and ADR we have in the community, our web traffic being up 80% versus the first half of 2020, 158% versus 2019. We have an 82% increase in travelers aged 18 to 24 and a 39% increase in travelers aged 35 to -- or excuse me, 25 to 34. 1.3 million followers on Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. RVIA, the RV Industry Association estimates that there will be 575,000 RV sales in 2021. And if you look at it, an 80% increase in the first-time guests to the Sun.  I mean, for sure, some people were revert back to old vacation habits. They'll take trips, they'll get on airplanes. We're seeing that today. You can't read a paper without seeing how much airline travel has picked up. I'm heading down to the airport tomorrow. I'm glad I'm on clear because hopefully, I'll get through faster because I have heard how busy it is at the airport. And -- but the prospects for RV, frankly, have never been stronger. And just the fact that there's so many new people that have come in and enjoyed the outdoor asset class we will retain some, okay? So it's incrementally better for us.  And then finally, I think you really have to consider the new entrants in the space that are getting a lot of capital behind them like Outdoorsy and RVShare for all those RVs that are sitting down in people's yards and driveways they are being activated again. So instead of 11 million RVs for every 1 million sites, there are, it really feels like a lot more than that. I think we're seeing that come in. So I've said it for a number of calls here, but -- and Gary has too, this discovery is for real. And it's all good because incrementally, we'll pick up more than we had before.\nJohn Pawlowski: Understood. That's certainly a powerful statistics. So your sense if you had a bet on it, is your sense that just take year-to-date $170 million in RV revenue. Is that a sustainable base to grow off of these next few years?\nGary Shiffman: Yes, I think we're all [indiscernible]. We have been growing for the last 10 years at a very healthy rate. So as John said, if we just continue growing the way we've historically grown and have any incremental percentage of all the available demand going forward, even if some of it subsides. We should be able to continue to deliver very good returns to the shareholders. And I just want to add one thing to it. I think that I wouldn't want anyone to under -- overlook, let me put it that way, overlook the strategic planning that goes into our acquisition activity, I touched on it a little earlier, building traffic patterns on both coasts, north to south, south to north and east to west.  When we're out there acquiring , we're just not acquiring to become larger. We're acquiring to create the set of assets to keep people, much like Safe Harbor does within the Sun RV Resort program. John, we haven't touched on it, but we have a big loyalty program and a lot of branding efforts and things that you'll see roll out over the next 12 months or so that are very much associated with generating more sustainable loyalty within the brand. So I think we feel very, very positive as best we can looking out as to the growth we can continue to sustain here.\nJohn Pawlowski: Understood. Just last quick question for me. Do the Safe Harbor folks expect drought or any other severe kind of weather-related impacts on revenue in the near term?\nGary Shiffman: That's a great question. The answer is we do not, okay? But that being said, it's hard not to pay attention to all the climate concerns that are out there today. And certainly, we're very focused on it as an entire company. When it comes to Safe Harbor, you may recall, even reviewing the transaction at the board level. We focused very much on climate thoughts and process and climate change and the financial impacts. The first thing that we did was to look at increasing our property and casualty insurance related to name storm impacts. So we've done that already. Post acquisition, Safe Harbor had done a Brown University study and climate control. It was headed by a professor, I think his name was Kurt Falling [ph].  And it indicated on a present value worse case scenario, looking out over 15 years, there could be $10 million of ground damage and I just suggest that's due to the fact that 90% of the marina assets are on the water and they float up and down with the water level. It's an impact on what happens on land. And then subsequent to the acquisition further focus, we -- Safe Harbor has reengaged with Brown University, and we're expecting over the next quarter or so the results of new updated climate impact on the Safe Harbor Marinas. So we're looking forward to sharing that with everybody as we get that completed over the next quarter or 2.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Marina NOI doubled from the first quarter to the second quarter. I think the guidance at the beginning of the year called for a 60% sequential increase. You've acquired more marina since then, but can you, like, help break down where that outperformance came from?\nKaren Dearing: I would think in referring to the increase in marina NOI is really based on seasonality, right? So your marina seasonality is probably lowest in the Q4, Q2 -- I mean, Q1. Q2 and Q3 are the highest marina NOI generations. So I think probably looking at a seasonality aspect to that growth as well as what you mentioned their acquisitions.\nMichael Goldsmith: Okay. Okay. We could discuss that offline. But the guidance for the implied fourth quarter core FFO of $1.19 to $1.25. The midpoint is a little bit lower than what you guided to at the beginning of the year. Or what was implied with that? Is there more than just share issuances and wage increases in the fourth quarter? And then that amounts to 3% to 8% core FFO growth on the -- on a more normal comparison? Is that a good way to think about kind of the future runway rate of FFO growth?\nKaren Dearing: To your first point, in Q4, again, I think there's some misalignment of seasonality on estimates in ours and analysts. I think the impact of the equity offering, as you mentioned, is in there in Q4. And there is not only the higher level payroll costs, there's also $4 million of costs associated with the branding of our RV platform that Gary mentioned and some higher corporate wages and incentive comp based on outperformance that we've been experiencing as an organization. And I'm sorry, what was your other question?\nMichael Goldsmith: So the implied fourth quarter FFO growth, it implies 3% to 8% growth over 2020. So is that kind of like a sustainable way to think about how FFO could grow going forward?\nKaren Dearing: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBradley Heffern: On marinas and sort of a follow-up to the prior question. You've done all the acquisitions, and you mentioned that the underwriting has been exceeding -- or sorry, the performance has been exceeding the underwriting expectations. Can you give any sort of like round number as to where you think run rate NOI is as we sit here today?\nKaren Dearing: I think what I could say is that for the second quarter, marina outperformance was higher than our internal estimates by about $9.5 million. I think going into the remainder of the year, our guidance range of $0.31 includes about $0.09 to $0.10 of our guidance raise -- range, I should say, of $0.31 includes about $0.09 to $0.10 from the marinas segment.\nBradley Heffern: Yes. Okay. Okay. Got it. And then you all mentioned that you have a new development -- newly developed marina coming online across from Lauderdale. Is that likely to be a significant source of organic growth going forward? Is that sort of just a one-off? Or is it something that you're going to deploy more capital to newly developed marinas?\nGary Shiffman: I'd like to think we have more opportunity there. But due to the difficulty and length of entitlement and the ability to build new marinas. It's likely to be more of a one-off, and I would expect we'll have other one-offs. But not a lot of opportunity to build new marina and that is one of the things that attracted us to the marina platform very similar to what attracted us to manufactured housing and the RV platform.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: John, you mentioned the typical 50% increase in revenue you get when you convert transient RV to annual seasonal. But can you talk about the conversion rate? Has that changed or come down dramatically just given the change in demographic of your transit RV customers?\nJohn McLaren: No. In fact, it's running, it's tracking ahead, 744 that we've done. I mean, I think some of this is a product of the increased demand that we're seeing in the asset class with more people coming to the resorts and more activity and interest in the resorts. But also, frankly, just to -- I've talked about this for years, the experience that they're having. And it's a pretty logical thing for people that really want to be in the outdoors and rather than coming to a resort and perhaps staying at a different site every time you come and you start to gain friends, people that you hang around with in the resorts, and they like to congregate together. And so we're really pleased with the success. And I would actually say that I would think that we would do a little bit better than the normal 1,000 to 1,100 that we do on an annual basis.\nJohn Kim: So you had 17% same-store revenue growth in annual season. Is there upside to that number in future quarters?\nGary Shiffman: It's a tough question. We look forward to reporting third quarter and sharing that with you, but I think that our underlying message would be that on top of the type of RV, MH and marina growth, but just sticking with the RV for a moment that we've been experiencing with the expansions and with the development, in particular, in the RV space. Anything that we gained from the wind at our back under the unfortunate circumstance that was perhaps a direct result of the pandemic and different travel choices and patterns. And this movement to outdoors will help us sustain, if not improve the kind of growth we're seeing right now.\nJohn Kim: Okay. I noticed your net debt-to-EBITDA went down a turn this quarter to 5.1How much is this going to jump around going forward? I realize it's a trailing 12-month EBITDA number, but I'm not sure if there was something unusual with service, retail and entertainment NOI this quarter. Also, I noticed that the EBITDA included asset sale gains, and I'm not sure if you're going to do a lot of dispositions going forward? Like how much of this 5.1 going to move in upcoming quarters?\nKaren Dearing: The drop is really from basically seeing the impact of Safe Harbor and other acquisitions in our EBITDA. So fully finally having the EBITDA in our earnings because it's on a trailing 12 months, we didn't have that. So if you did it -- if you looked at that 5.1 today and you fully loaded it for additional EBITDA that's not in that trailing 12, it would be about 4.8x. We've said before, we're comfortable in the mid-5s, but going to those levels is going to be transaction related. So it shouldn't be jumping around too much now, except for based on acquisition EBITDA.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Gary, can you clarify -- I'm not sure if you stated it, but the cap rates were in your two MH dispositions this quarter?\nGary Shiffman: Yes, average 4.3 . So we were very pleased with the fact that the market supported that type of cap rate for those properties.\nJohn Kim: And the rationale...\nGary Shiffman: Multiple bit of -- I'm sorry, go ahead.\nJohn Kim: I was just saying the rationale is there were, I think, slower growth, but are you also making a statement about some of your Midwest exposure?\nGary Shiffman: Not at all. Our asset management just really looks at the expected 5-year growth within the core portfolio. And then this goes with our acquisitions as well as our dispositions. We try and match so that things are equal to or accretive to the core portfolio. That's why we always say when we're acquiring something, cap rate is important, but more important are the growth patterns and how we can achieve equal to or greater growth in the portfolio to continue to support our historical returns on a per share basis. Same with dispositions, these would be ones that typically wouldn't support that type of growth or would require a significant amount of capital investment to do so. And therefore, John and his team determined we could redeploy the capital in better ways.\nJohn Kim: Okay. My final question is on your 80% increase in website traffic to Sun RV Resorts website. Can you talk about the advertising dollars that you spent to generate that traffic?\nJohn McLaren: I don't have those figures in front of me right now, John, but we can certainly circle back provide some detail on that to you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nGary Shiffman: Thank you, everybody. And we certainly were very, very pleased at the first half of this year and look forward to sharing with you progress on the next quarterly conference call. Be safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karen Dearing",
            "content": "Thanks, John. For the second quarter, Sun reported core FFO per share of $1.80, 60.7% above the prior year and $0.17 ahead of the top end of our second quarter guidance range.  Outperformance was achieved across all business lines. Our manufactured housing business experienced higher-than-forecasted revenue, including rental home revenue and other community-related fees and charges as well as lower-than-expected operating expenses.  Annual RV revenue as well as transient and vacation rental revenues drove strong results in the RV segment, partially offset by higher operating expenses including wages and benefits, utilities and supply and repair costs. And the marina business was bolstered by higher boat slip, storage and service revenues, offset by higher payroll costs as well as utility and repair costs.  During the quarter and subsequent to quarter-end, we acquired over $719 million of operating properties, bringing our year-to-date total to over $853 million, adding 28 properties totaling over 7,600 manufactured housing and RV sites, marina wet slips and dry storage spaces.  To support our operations and growth activities, we have been active in enhancing our balance sheet and in capital markets activity, which provide the capacity and flexibility to pursue our ongoing growth pipeline. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased to have received investment-grade ratings with stable outlooks from both S&P and Moody's. We followed this news with a successful $600 million inaugural bond offering in mid-June. Additionally, during the second quarter, we drew on the remainder of the forward equity sales agreement we had entered into in March. We settled 4 million shares with net proceeds of $540 million, the majority of which was used to fund our acquisitions and pay down our line of credit. Finally, we recast our revolving line of credit agreement. We replaced the prior $750 million line and safe harbor's prior $1.8 billion line with a combined $2 billion revolver with a $1 billion expansion option.  We ended the second quarter with $4.3 billion of debt outstanding at a 3.5% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 10.4 years. As of June 30, we had $104 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio of 5.1x.  We are raising our full year 2021 core FFO guidance to a range of $6.25 to $6.37 per share, a $0.31 increase at the midpoint from our prior range, which represents year-over-year growth of 24% at the midpoint. Approximately $0.17 of the increase is due to our outperformance in the second quarter with the remainder due to contributions from our recent acquisitions and increased expectations across each of our businesses, particularly transient RV. This is offset by approximately $8 million of property level proactive wage increases for the remainder of the year, which Gary previously discussed, of which approximately half had been included in prior issued guidance.  Additionally, we estimate an impact of $0.11 per share for the remainder of the year from the settlement of the forward equity offering completed in the second quarter. We expect core FFO for the third quarter to be in the range of $2 to $2.06 per share representing 27% year-over-year growth at the midpoint on top of the 10% growth we delivered in 2020 over 2019. We are also revising full year same community NOI growth guidance to a range of 9.9% to 10.7%, up 230 basis points from the previous midpoint of guidance of 8%. This revised NOI growth range is inclusive of the aforementioned increased property level payroll expenses. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates.  This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator? Yes. The Q3 results, as we've mentioned, are highly driven on transient RV and marina. So in the marina side, it's service really that's driving it. And on the RV side, it's retail dining, entertainment and other fees and charges. So I would expect continued outperformance from those areas in Q3. I'm sorry, could you ask the question again? Was it ahead of our internal ... Well, Josh, you noticed this. It used to be called revenue producing. And when we brought the Marina portfolio and we changed it to growth projects. So you're correct. There is a piece of this is what these projects are or projects that are either revenue-producing or expense savings. So they include things like our solar project, other utility conservation projects. From the Safe Harbor side, it includes the slip configuration, the dry storage improvements and some of their water suite rental boats that they're including. So about $11-plus million of it is from the MH, RV side and the remainder of it is Safe Harbor. I would think in referring to the increase in marina NOI is really based on seasonality, right? So your marina seasonality is probably lowest in the Q4, Q2 -- I mean, Q1. Q2 and Q3 are the highest marina NOI generations. So I think probably looking at a seasonality aspect to that growth as well as what you mentioned their acquisitions. To your first point, in Q4, again, I think there's some misalignment of seasonality on estimates in ours and analysts. I think the impact of the equity offering, as you mentioned, is in there in Q4. And there is not only the higher level payroll costs, there's also $4 million of costs associated with the branding of our RV platform that Gary mentioned and some higher corporate wages and incentive comp based on outperformance that we've been experiencing as an organization. And I'm sorry, what was your other question? Yes. I think what I could say is that for the second quarter, marina outperformance was higher than our internal estimates by about $9.5 million. I think going into the remainder of the year, our guidance range of $0.31 includes about $0.09 to $0.10 of our guidance raise -- range, I should say, of $0.31 includes about $0.09 to $0.10 from the marinas segment. The drop is really from basically seeing the impact of Safe Harbor and other acquisitions in our EBITDA. So fully finally having the EBITDA in our earnings because it's on a trailing 12 months, we didn't have that. So if you did it -- if you looked at that 5.1 today and you fully loaded it for additional EBITDA that's not in that trailing 12, it would be about 4.8x. We've said before, we're comfortable in the mid-5s, but going to those levels is going to be transaction related. So it shouldn't be jumping around too much now, except for based on acquisition EBITDA."

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our second quarter 2021 results. We are pleased with the continued outstanding performance of all our business segments. In the second quarter, we delivered 61% growth in core FFO per share to $1.80 as compared to the second quarter of 2020, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $1.63 as our ongoing momentum accelerated beyond our forecasted expectations.  Comparing to a non-COVID impact quarter, our second quarter FFO per share was 53% greater than the second quarter of 2019. This outperformance, along with a positive outlook for the third and fourth quarters, once again, led us to raise our core 2021 FFO guidance range by $0.31 at the midpoint to $6.25 to $6.37 per share. The change is being driven by continued outperformance of Transient RV, Marinas, the sustained strength in our manufactured housing portfolio and our robust acquisition activity, particularly as we begin to realize the meaningful Marina industry consolidation opportunity. Complementing our operational performance was Sun's well-received inaugural unsecured bond issuance and following our investment-grade rating from S&P and Moody's. We issued $600 million of senior notes in an oversubscribed offering in mid-June.  Sun's access to the bond market provides us with enhanced financial flexibility to most efficiently match fund our investment activities. With a healthy pipeline of internal and external growth opportunities, we believe this was the right time for this step, and we'll look to continue enhancing our credit metrics over time for improved ratings.  For the quarter, same community NOI grew 21.6% over last year, reflecting the continued demand in each of our segments and our favorable strategic positioning to capture that demand. We entered the quarter with same community occupancy of 98.8%, a 160 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2020 with manufactured housing same community NOI growing by 5.4% and RV same community NOI growing by 85.1%. Year-to-date, we have filled more than 1,000 revenue-producing manufactured housing and annual RV sites and have delivered more than 580 ground-up and expansion sites that will continue providing the runway for growth over subsequent quarters.  New site deliveries are one of Sun's key levers that we anticipate continuing to contribute to a sustained growth profile and value creation. As of quarter end, we had approximately 9,400 sites available for development that we anticipate delivering over time. We have also remained active in growing our portfolio, adding 18 properties in the second quarter and through this earnings call, deploying over $719 million of capital and adding more than 5,000 sites wet slips and dry storage spaces. This brings year-to-date acquisition volume to over $853 million across 28 properties.  Our acquisition teams remain extremely active, sourcing deals and channeling them through our underwriting process. We are very enthusiastic about the opportunities we are seeing across each of Sun's businesses. Our excellent reputation as a transaction partner and our structuring flexibility gives us access to off-market transactions across manufactured housing communities, RV resorts and marinas. Subsequent to quarter-end, we completed the disposition of 2 manufactured housing assets that no longer fit our core strategy. We sold these assets at a 4.3% cap rate, which we believe is a very positive indicator of the value and quality of our core portfolio.  Our RV resort business is benefiting from the demand for outdoor experiences. As we have been discussing throughout the pandemic, once travel restrictions began to lift, RV travel quickly emerged as a vacation option of choice. Importantly, even as broader travel has picked up, it is clear that people who have experienced the benefits of RV travel and the quality and amenities that Sun Resorts offer are becoming repeat customers. There has been no waning of demand for RV vacationing even as other forms of leisure travel have become available and bounce back. As John will discuss, we are confident this segment will remain strong for several reasons, including our solid forward bookings for transient and our annual site conversions.  In our marina business, results continue to track ahead of underwriting, and we are in the midst of an active boating season.  In summary, we are pleased with our results and optimistic about our outlook. We continue to achieve strong operational results and realize internal and external growth opportunities. Furthermore, with our equity raised in the first quarter and our recent bond issuance, we are well positioned to execute on each of these prospects.  Finally, I want to take a moment to recognize and thank the entire Sun team for their unwavering hard work and dedication. Our team members are the reason we continue to deliver the type of outperformance we have been discussing. We believe that one element of that success is our commitment to ESG matters, which are becoming increasingly woven into all aspects of our business.  As part of that enhanced focus, there is one element I wanted to highlight today. We are proactively adjusting our pay structure at the property level to ensure that pay is properly aligned with a number of factors, including job responsibilities, tenure service and appropriate living wages. While this is resulting in a payroll expense increase, we are committed to making Sun the best employer, which will facilitate us continuing to foster a dedicated, skilled and healthy team.  I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational performance. John? Nick, the competition stays pretty similar as to what we've expressed in the past. There are a number of newly formed platforms that we're encouvering out there, small to midsize looking to grow their portfolios. We announced the sale of 2 properties as dispositions in our earnings release that went to a group that is certainly growing their platform. Lots of competition out there in the MH, the RV side, and we're starting to see it a little bit on the marina side. Cap rates, although I know it wasn't part of your question, seemed pretty similar to where they've been and what we've shared in the past. The MH and RV all falling generally for us in the 4% to 5% cap rate range, and we're seeing them dip even sub-3% in some cases. So a lot of capital looking to acquire fewer and fewer available assets out there today. I think that John would share these sentiments and feel free to add anything that we, from time-to-time, do a very close look at our assets and generally where we find assets that don't fit the growth pattern of the rest of the portfolio. We'll look at the potential disposition. You'd have to go back, I think, all the way to 2014 or '15 to the last dispositions that we do. I think in assembling best-in-class RV and MH platform over the last 10 years or so in the industry, they're is just a little bit of calling that will take place every so often when we don't meet those growth trajectories or have other reasons for selling assets. There's a handful of fiber under properties that were identified on our disposition that may remain non-transact in the near future. Yes, it's Gary. Absolutely. There is a -- as we discussed a higher demand for bigger slips, longer slips as both being sold tend to be longer in length. So where we can convert smaller slips into those in higher demand, the longer slips that continually is taking place. Not-too-distant future, we will look to open a brand-new marina development, which strategically is directly across the river from the Lauderdale Marina that was just acquired. So we'll be able to expand that marina facility. So it's an ongoing process that Safe Harbor management has done very, very similar to Sun's MH and RV platform of studying the existing assets and creating value out of redeveloping and reinvesting capital where we can. Keegan, I think what we shared when we acquired and announced the transaction with Safe Harbor that the Safe Harbor rental income would represent about -- at that time, it was about 17% of Sun's rental revenues. If you fast forward to today, even with all the acquisition that's taken place, it represents about 18% of our rental revenues. The goal initially shared with our stakeholders similar to what we did in the RV business. We grew our RV rental revenue from about 11% in the mid-2000s to about 25%, 30% to date. And we would be prepared at the time, my remarks were to go to 20% to 25% of rental revenue in marina. But as it happens, we've been very successful with the continued strong pipeline in the MH and RV side. So we moved the needle about 1 percentage point with all the marina acquisitions to date. Yes. Similar to real estate, it's all about location and demand in any given area. And I'd share a big picture that very similar to what we accomplished at Sun in RV and MH. We focused on the East Coast. we are very strong -- we're very strong in Florida as Safe Harbor has moved up the coast to the north all the way to Maine as Safe Harbor is doing to create a footprint that the members at Safe Harbor can travel within the system of Safe Harbor. We think that's true and a differentiator, if you will, from the strong platform the Safe Harbor has created and creating.  And then we will move to the West Coast, very similar to what we did in MH and RV. We've already begun our efforts there with several acquisitions on the West Coast, and we will look to create membership pattern and traffic up and down the West Coast as well from areas like Seattle all the way down to San Diego. And the goal, again, is to create a consistency and a quality of expectation throughout the Safe Harbor membership. So the goal is they actually will never want to stay anywhere but a Safe Harbor marina if we can provide the footprint for them to do so. Yes, we worked through it. I think it was, if anything, faster than we would have expected. When we made the decision, and it's something we review as part of our first quarter review with our Board of Directors and senior management, reviewing all things Sun, including the balance sheet. We determined that the timing seemed right and I think that all the work that's gone into Sun's balance sheet, its history and the fact it was investment-graded -- investment-grade rated prior to 2004 assisted in a very fast approval and the investment-grade rating that we saw. Our goal is to continue to work with the agencies and demonstrate a process that can improve the rating as we move forward. It absolutely is a great question, Samir. Each year we're faced with that same question externally and internally. We've been very fortunate have a great acquisitions team, and now we have a great acquisition teams, if you will, [indiscernible]. The marina acquisition team at Safe Harbor has joined the company, along with our existing MH and RV team. It's getting harder and harder. There is more and more competition from small investors, as I said earlier, all the way to big platforms that are out there that are well capitalized. The 1031 exchange competition that's out there has made it more and more difficult. In general, one of the things that has succeeded -- helped us succeed in our acquisitions is the deep relationships, the deep history, the fact that we've been so acquisitive for the last 10-plus years.  So there really isn't a transaction that happens out there in the MH and RV space that Sun doesn't have an opportunity to take a look at or isn't brought to that transaction first. Some of them are off market, and that's where we've been very, very successful. They're not brokered. They come directly to us. And others, we're very competitive in the auctions with the brokers, but we're not chasing things that don't work for our growth pattern.  So the short answer is, it's becoming more and more difficult. I think we will continue to be successful. The view that we have in the pipeline right now is pretty similar as we've shared over the last few quarterly calls. We will look to continue to ramp up our new community development. I've indicated we've got about 8,400 sites currently under contract in various forms of either closing or entitlement and rezoning efforts and where we can build communities to high single-digit unlevered IRRs on stabilization. We will look to continue to ramp up that business over the next 3 to 5 years. And if we should fall short at all in the acquisition area, we think we'll more than make up for the growth on the new community development level. Yes, I think we're all [indiscernible]. We have been growing for the last 10 years at a very healthy rate. So as John said, if we just continue growing the way we've historically grown and have any incremental percentage of all the available demand going forward, even if some of it subsides. We should be able to continue to deliver very good returns to the shareholders. And I just want to add one thing to it. I think that I wouldn't want anyone to under -- overlook, let me put it that way, overlook the strategic planning that goes into our acquisition activity, I touched on it a little earlier, building traffic patterns on both coasts, north to south, south to north and east to west.  When we're out there acquiring , we're just not acquiring to become larger. We're acquiring to create the set of assets to keep people, much like Safe Harbor does within the Sun RV Resort program. John, we haven't touched on it, but we have a big loyalty program and a lot of branding efforts and things that you'll see roll out over the next 12 months or so that are very much associated with generating more sustainable loyalty within the brand. So I think we feel very, very positive as best we can looking out as to the growth we can continue to sustain here. That's a great question. The answer is we do not, okay? But that being said, it's hard not to pay attention to all the climate concerns that are out there today. And certainly, we're very focused on it as an entire company. When it comes to Safe Harbor, you may recall, even reviewing the transaction at the board level. We focused very much on climate thoughts and process and climate change and the financial impacts. The first thing that we did was to look at increasing our property and casualty insurance related to name storm impacts. So we've done that already. Post acquisition, Safe Harbor had done a Brown University study and climate control. It was headed by a professor, I think his name was Kurt Falling [ph].  And it indicated on a present value worse case scenario, looking out over 15 years, there could be $10 million of ground damage and I just suggest that's due to the fact that 90% of the marina assets are on the water and they float up and down with the water level. It's an impact on what happens on land. And then subsequent to the acquisition further focus, we -- Safe Harbor has reengaged with Brown University, and we're expecting over the next quarter or so the results of new updated climate impact on the Safe Harbor Marinas. So we're looking forward to sharing that with everybody as we get that completed over the next quarter or 2. I'd like to think we have more opportunity there. But due to the difficulty and length of entitlement and the ability to build new marinas. It's likely to be more of a one-off, and I would expect we'll have other one-offs. But not a lot of opportunity to build new marina and that is one of the things that attracted us to the marina platform very similar to what attracted us to manufactured housing and the RV platform. It's a tough question. We look forward to reporting third quarter and sharing that with you, but I think that our underlying message would be that on top of the type of RV, MH and marina growth, but just sticking with the RV for a moment that we've been experiencing with the expansions and with the development, in particular, in the RV space. Anything that we gained from the wind at our back under the unfortunate circumstance that was perhaps a direct result of the pandemic and different travel choices and patterns. And this movement to outdoors will help us sustain, if not improve the kind of growth we're seeing right now. Yes, average 4.3 . So we were very pleased with the fact that the market supported that type of cap rate for those properties. Multiple bit of -- I'm sorry, go ahead. Not at all. Our asset management just really looks at the expected 5-year growth within the core portfolio. And then this goes with our acquisitions as well as our dispositions. We try and match so that things are equal to or accretive to the core portfolio. That's why we always say when we're acquiring something, cap rate is important, but more important are the growth patterns and how we can achieve equal to or greater growth in the portfolio to continue to support our historical returns on a per share basis. Same with dispositions, these would be ones that typically wouldn't support that type of growth or would require a significant amount of capital investment to do so. And therefore, John and his team determined we could redeploy the capital in better ways. Thank you, everybody. And we certainly were very, very pleased at the first half of this year and look forward to sharing with you progress on the next quarterly conference call. Be safe. Thank you."

            "name": "John McLaren",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Sun delivered a strong second quarter across the board, outperforming our prior expectations in RV, marinas and manufactured housing. Our results reflect the combination of the stability of our best-in-class portfolio as well as the incremental benefits of our growth initiatives across our 3 business lines.  For the second quarter, combined same community manufactured housing and RV NOI increased 21.6% from the second quarter 2020. The growth in NOI was driven by a 22.5% revenue gain, supported by a 160 basis point increase in occupancy to 98.8% and a 3.3% weighted average rent increase. This was offset by a 24.7% expense increase compared to the second quarter of last year when we had implemented expense saving measures, including furloughs of properties impacted by COVID-related closures. Same community manufactured housing NOI increased by 5.4% from 2020 and same-community RV NOI increased by 85.1%. The RV growth reflects both the impact from COVID-related delayed opening of 44 of our resorts on last year's results as well as the incredibly strong transient demand this year. Given the stay at home orders that were in place during the second quarter of 2020, we think it is helpful to look at these results relative to the second quarter of 2019.  For all of our comparisons to 2019, we are utilizing last year's same community pool of 367 communities. Compared to 2019, the portfolio's NOI CAGR was 9.7%, and the CAGR for revenues and expenses were 8.5% and 5.9%, respectively. The RV NOI CAGR was up by 18.6%, including a 19.6% increase in transient RV revenues. Looking at the most recent holiday weekends further illustrates how demand has escalated. For Memorial Day weekend, RV revenue was up 39% compared to 2019. Similarly, for the 4th of July weekend, revenue improved 35% compared to 2019 and 36.5% compared to 2020, driven by a 10.5% increase in occupancy and a 19% increase in average daily rate. We are pleased that so many new consumers have recently taken initial RV vacation. Moreover, we are confident that many of these vacationers have discovered the joy of RV travel and the quality outdoor experience at a Sun RV Resort. Therefore, even as other forms of travel have reopened or are deemed to be safe again, we are seeing demand persist through the second half of 2021.  I would like to highlight a few metrics which illustrate the increasing interest in Sun vacations and the engagement and loyalty of our guests. Traffic to our Sun RV Resorts website was incredibly strong in the first half of 2021, up almost 80% from the first half of 2020 and 158% compared to 2019. Within this growth, we are seeing a shift to a younger audience with significant increase in guests aged 18 to 34. Our social media efforts are attracting the largest following and engagement in the industry with over 1.3 million followers on 3 of the largest social media platforms, Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. A big element of a Sun vacation is the community and the activities we provide and these channels are in an ideal way to continue to showcase what we offer and to nurture community element to drive repeat guests.  From the same community perspective, first-time guests to our resorts increased 80% on during the first half of the year compared to 2019. We are also piloting a new RV resorts loyalty program where guests can earn points for stays and redeem them for benefits, discounts or free nights on future vacations. With the size of the Sun portfolio and the geographic variety we offer, we believe this program will further encourage guests to choose a Sun RV Resort as their vacation destination. As we look to the back half of the year, our transient forecast is trending 15.2% ahead of our original 2021 budget.  There are a number of dynamics supporting the continuation of these positive demand trends. One is a strong sale of new RVs. According to the RV Industry Association, 2021 RV unit sales are projected to be 34% higher than in 2020 and reached a new industry record. Additionally, there are a few promising venture-backed platforms, including RVShare and Outdoorsy, which allow owners to rent their personal RVs, providing a new option for consumers seeking an outdoor vacation without the capital outlay of buying an RV. These platforms help activate otherwise idle RVs, which we believe will fuel additional demand for RV Resorts.  With respect to the total MH & RV portfolio, in the second quarter, we gained 583 revenue-producing sites. Of our revenue-producing site gains over 350 transient RV sites were converted to annual leases, with the balance being added to our manufactured housing expansion communities. With the increase in RV guests, we're able to realize the opportunity to convert transient sites to annual leases and achieve an average 50% increase in site revenues during the first year of conversion.  Moving on to new construction. In the second quarter, we delivered approximately 220 new sites, 100 of which were ground-up developments and 120 were expansion sites. The ground-up development deliveries include RV sites at our newly opened camp Fimfo outside of Austin and Texas Hill country. This marks the first delivery in a planned series of new ground-up family-focused RV resorts within one of our JV partnerships. Those of you wondering, Fimfo stands for funs is more fun outdoors. These completed expansion and ground-up development sites will contribute to revenue growth in 2021 and beyond as they fill up and stabilize.  Manufactured housing home sales in the second quarter is another area where we saw a tremendous increase compared to the same period last year. Total sales volume was up approximately 90% year-over-year as we sold more than 1,100 homes in the quarter. Compared to 2019, this sales volume represents an increase of 25%. We believe the growth is due to a number of factors, including pent-up demand from limited home moves during the pandemic, the attainable nature of the homes in our communities in an increasingly tight real estate market, and lower relative increases for the construction and material costs of our product versus site-built housing.  Average home prices during the quarter for new and preowned homes rose 11.6% and 23.3%, respectively, underscoring the overall geographic mix as well as sustained demand for our product and the strong desire to live in a high-quality Sun community. This favorable demand environment helped support attractive gross margin results for both new and preowned home sales which expanded 50 basis points and 14.6 percentage points, respectively, compared to the prior year period. Additionally, brokered home sales volume was up 113% compared to the second quarter of 2020 with the average home value increasing by 26%.  In terms of our operations, in our manufactured housing business, we are benefiting from sustained strength and fundamentals and demand for affordable housing. Applications to live in a Sun Community were up more than 20% compared to 2020 in the second quarter and year-to-date.  Turning to the marina business. We ended the quarter with 114 properties comprising nearly 41,300 wet slips in dry storage spaces, which includes the acquisition of 4 properties for approximately $423 million completed in the second quarter. Better-than-expected performance for the marina portfolio continues to come from demand for wet slips and dry storage spaces. Same marina rental revenue growth for the portfolio of 75 properties owned and operated by safe harbor since the start of 2019 was almost 17% for the first half of 2021 over 2019. This is a CAGR increase in rental revenue of 9.7% for the quarter and 8% for the first half of 2021.  Overall, the marinas are performing ahead of expectations and the safe harbor team continues to source attractive acquisitions as Gary discussed. According to the National Marine Manufacturers industry, both dealers are seeing record levels of demand. New boat sales reached a 13-year high in 2020, and they remain at elevated levels with most recent reported sales data through March 2021, up 30% compared to the 2020 average.  In summary, we are very encouraged by our performance across all of our businesses year-to-date and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Secular demand trends are acting as a tailwind, and Sun has the platform and expertise to capture that demand and realize attractive growth. The combination of the favorable macro environment, along with the strategy Sun has been implementing for years, has positioned us very well to continue to execute on our initiatives, drive industry-leading growth and create long-term value for all stakeholders.  Karen will now discuss our financial results in more detail. Karen? Wes, this is John. Yes, I mean, reiterating some of the metrics that we shared in the prepared remarks, I mean, the traffic that we're seeing come into our community in terms of web traffic, the 80% increase in first-time guests versus 2019. I think one of the more sort of significant drivers that's contributing is we've talked a lot before about having 11 million registered RVs out there against about 1 million sites. But when you have platforms like Outdoorsy and RVShare, like I mentioned earlier, that really makes that number feel a lot higher than that. We don't know what it is. It could be 12 million, it could be 13 million as vital RVs are engaged throughout America. But -- so the activity is pretty incredible.  With that said, we have always been in that realm of 1,000 to 1,100 conversions that we would do. And one of the things that we do on a continual basis throughout the portfolio is look at each property on a site-by-site basis and kind of derive the right balance between revenue on a per site basis versus whether it remains a transient side or it becomes an annual site. And as you can see, we had still and we'll continue to grow the annual side of the business as well because we have converted over, I think, 744 year-to-date, which is actually tracking a little bit elevated from what we do on a normal year basis. So in a nutshell, it really is kind of a balance on a property-by-property basis, which we will be watching vigilantly as we always do for execution. Josh, it's John. It obviously is a significant contributor more than anything else with Campspot from the reservation process and the fact that the system itself has a built-in algorithm that adjust for the most efficient rate and occupancy equation helps kind of -- as I've described before, I mean, every time, every weekend that comes along every week in the portfolio, it's sort of like putting the jigsaw puzzle together. And so this maximizes that grid automatically within the system.  And that's just -- but that's just a piece of everything that's contributing on the RV side because it can also go the other way, which is from a revenue management standpoint, if we've got some lower occupancy weekdays, we can actually adjust the rates downward to fill more occupancy in the community. And so what we're able to do then just like we've done historically for years, Sun's had a significant focus on the shoulder months associated with our Snowbird season. Now we have sort of shoulder days associated with every week. And so we're seeing those contributions come in by moving up and down in terms of rate as well as the grid in the occupancy within a given community. Yes. Great question, John. I appreciate it. I mean I've got a whole bunch of metrics I can go through here, which is to say, you look at the growth we've had in RV same community NOI up 85% in the second quarter. If you look at the Memorial Day, the holiday revenue growth that we've had from Memorial Day and 4th of July up 39% and 35% versus 2019. You look at a really healthy split and how that growth has happened between occupancy and ADR we have in the community, our web traffic being up 80% versus the first half of 2020, 158% versus 2019. We have an 82% increase in travelers aged 18 to 24 and a 39% increase in travelers aged 35 to -- or excuse me, 25 to 34. 1.3 million followers on Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. RVIA, the RV Industry Association estimates that there will be 575,000 RV sales in 2021. And if you look at it, an 80% increase in the first-time guests to the Sun.  I mean, for sure, some people were revert back to old vacation habits. They'll take trips, they'll get on airplanes. We're seeing that today. You can't read a paper without seeing how much airline travel has picked up. I'm heading down to the airport tomorrow. I'm glad I'm on clear because hopefully, I'll get through faster because I have heard how busy it is at the airport. And -- but the prospects for RV, frankly, have never been stronger. And just the fact that there's so many new people that have come in and enjoyed the outdoor asset class we will retain some, okay? So it's incrementally better for us.  And then finally, I think you really have to consider the new entrants in the space that are getting a lot of capital behind them like Outdoorsy and RVShare for all those RVs that are sitting down in people's yards and driveways they are being activated again. So instead of 11 million RVs for every 1 million sites, there are, it really feels like a lot more than that. I think we're seeing that come in. So I've said it for a number of calls here, but -- and Gary has too, this discovery is for real. And it's all good because incrementally, we'll pick up more than we had before. No. In fact, it's running, it's tracking ahead, 744 that we've done. I mean, I think some of this is a product of the increased demand that we're seeing in the asset class with more people coming to the resorts and more activity and interest in the resorts. But also, frankly, just to -- I've talked about this for years, the experience that they're having. And it's a pretty logical thing for people that really want to be in the outdoors and rather than coming to a resort and perhaps staying at a different site every time you come and you start to gain friends, people that you hang around with in the resorts, and they like to congregate together. And so we're really pleased with the success. And I would actually say that I would think that we would do a little bit better than the normal 1,000 to 1,100 that we do on an annual basis. I don't have those figures in front of me right now, John, but we can certainly circle back provide some detail on that to you."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good morning and thank you for joining us as we discuss our first quarter 2021 results. We're very pleased with the performance of all of our business lines as 2021 is off to a very strong start. In the first quarter, we delivered core FFO per share of $1.26, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of $1.17. Due to this outperformance and strong visibility into our second and third quarter transient RV bookings, we are raising our 2021 core FFO per share annual guidance range by $0.13 to $5.92 to $6.08 and our expected same community NOI growth for the full year by 190 basis points to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%. The momentum we experienced in our RV resorts in 2020 has only accelerated this year as the country continues to reopen. For the quarter, same community NOI growth was 2.7% over last year, despite the continued Canadian border closure and the California stay-at-home order which dictated the closure of our California resorts through early February. We achieved total portfolio occupancy of 97.3%, a 60 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2020 by selling 514 revenue-producing sites. We also delivered approximately 350 ground-up and expansion sites in the first quarter, which include the grand opening of our premier 250 site Sun Outdoors San Diego Bay Resort. Since the beginning of the year, we have deployed $183 million into acquisitions, comprised of two manufactured housing communities, six RV resorts, and four marinas. Our team continues to find ways to add irreplaceable assets to our portfolio that serve to reinforce the high quality of our brand, enhance our offerings to our guests and foster continued growth of our revenues and earnings over time. In our manufactured housing business, our operations are benefiting from sustained strength and fundamentals and demand for affordable housing, evidenced by new, pre-owned, and brokered home sales. Furthermore, applications to live in a Sun community remain at record high levels, up 21% over this time last year. Our RV business, while impacted by the closures and the travel restrictions associated with the pandemic during the quarter, is showing resilience with forward bookings well ahead of both 2020 and 2019. As we emerge from the pandemic and as the percentage of the vaccinated population rises, we anticipate our best-in-class resorts to remain a preferred vacationing option. Our assertion is supported by the RV Industry Association stating record-year unit sale expectations for 2021 as well as our strong advance bookings for the second and third quarters. A broader segment of the population rediscovered the outdoors during 2020 and we are seeing that interest carry forward. In an environment impacted by COVID, RV provides travelers with an incremental level of safety and control. Moreover, we believe that increased demand is being driven by the continued desire of consumers to get back to a degree of normalcy, resuming vacation and leisure travel after last year's travel restrictions. In our marina business, results continue to track ahead of our underwriting and the team is preparing for an active boating season. According to multiple industry sources, boat sales have increased in demand year-over-year. With our expanded presence in this sought-after and scarce asset class, we are well-positioned to benefit from the increased demand for slips and moorings. We are relying on our four core investment strategies to support long-term resilience and the growth of our platform, further solidifying our position of delivering industry-leading results. An important part of these core strategies includes expansion and ground-up development. We wanted to highlight the recent opening of Sun Outdoors San Diego Bay first announced nearly four years ago. It is now open for guests and we are pleased to continue to realize meaningful accretion from our capital deployment activities. In early March, we executed a $1.1 billion equity raise to secure capital to fund our growing acquisition pipeline and other opportunities. We will match fund these growth initiatives with this equity. Key contributors to the success of our franchise are our ongoing efforts with regard to our environment and its sustainability, our social ecosystem and careful attention to governance. With that said, we wanted to provide some important updates with regard to our ESG initiatives. This month, we launched a new partnership with the National Park Foundation in support of the foundation's outdoor exploration program. Sun RV resorts has committed to contribute toward the National Park Foundation's mission to connect this and future generations with the social, mental and physical health benefits of national parks and outdoor discovery. With respect to our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, Sun has engaged with a consultancy team with 30 years of experience in the field of equality and justice. This group has deep expertise in the importance of breaking through unconscious bias and social injustices in the workplace. Together, we are assessing the current state of inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility at Sun, and developing an organization wide strategy to create positive change. Before handing the call over to John and Karen, I wanted to point out that we have enhanced our financial disclosures. With the addition of Safe Harbor, we took the opportunity to provide better insight into the primary drivers of our business. Karen will walk you through the changes we have implemented after John shares details about our operational performance. I will now turn the call over to John. John?\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. Sun delivered a strong first quarter across the board, setting the stage for a solid year. Our results reflect the combination of the stability of our manufactured housing business line and our same community portfolio, as well as the incremental benefits of our growth initiatives across MH, RV, and marina business lines. For the first quarter, combined same community NOI increased 2.7%. The growth in NOI was driven by a 3.5% revenue gain, supported by a 1.9% increase in occupancy to 98.8% and a 3.5 weighted average rent increase. This was offset by a 5.5% expense increase. As part of our revised disclosures we are now providing same community NOI for our manufactured housing and RV businesses. Same community manufactured housing NOI increased by 4.9% from 2020 and same community RV NOI declined by 4%. RV revenues were impacted by the Canadian border closure during the first quarter, which affected our snowboard season in the California shelter-inplace order that ran through early February. Combined these two events had a $6 million impact on our transient RV same community revenue as compared to our previously communicated estimate of $8 million to $10 million. With respect to RV revenue, we anticipate a significant rebound in the second and third quarters. RV resorts are beneficiaries of the reopening trade and we are fully participating. Our second quarter transient forecast is already ahead of our original budget by over 20% and trending 57% higher than 2019, which we believe to be a better comparable given COVID related disruptions in 2020. Likewise, our third quarter transient RV forecast is currently ahead of the original budget by approximately 5%, and this trending ahead of 2019 by almost 40%. In addition, we have a great deal of visibility into our reservations the rest of the year through Campspot, our proprietary RV reservation and revenue management software. Today digital reservations comprise over 60% of our total reservations for our same community portfolio as compared to 60%, just two years ago. Moving on to total MH and RV portfolio, in the first quarter we gained 514 revenue producing sites as compared to 300 in the first quarter of 2020, bringing our total portfolio occupancy to 97.3% from 96.7% a year ago. Of our revenue producing site gains over 380 transient RV sites were converted to annual leases with the balance being added in our manufactured housing expansion communities. A key component of our four core growth initiatives is the development of ground-up and expansion sites. In the first quarter we delivered approximately 350 sites, 250 of which in the ground-up development in San Diego and 100 were an MH expansion sites at Sunset Ridge in Texas. These complete expansion and ground-up development sites will contribute to RPS gains in 2021 and beyond, as they fill up and stabilize. As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately 9,700 zone and entitled sites in our portfolio that once built will contribute to growth in the coming years. Home sales in the quarter were particularly strong. We sold 835 homes, an increase of 9.4% versus the first quarter of 2020, of these 149 where new home sales, up over 25% and 686 were pre-owned home sales, up 6.5% as compared to the same period last year, respectively. Average home prices for both new and pre-owned homes rose 17.6% and 9.8% respectively underscoring the overall geographic market mix, as well as sustained demand for our product and the strong desire to live in a Sun Communities. Brokered home sales throughout Sun's portfolio saw 36% increase year-over-year as the resale market continues to show strength. Average brokered home prices in our communities increased by over 20% as compared to the first quarter of 2020. We believe that a vibrant resell market for homes in our communities demonstrates the benefits of the consistent reinvestment in our properties, creating equity value for our homeowners and increasing the overall value of our portfolio. Moving on to safe harbor; during the quarter the Marina portfolio contributed over $31.4 million to total NOI. The Marinas are performing ahead of our underwriting and the team continues to source acquisitions in irreplaceable locations, which for the first quarter include two Marinas on Islamorada and the Florida Keys, and two Marinas on Martha's Vineyard. We are optimistic about the underlying trends we are observing across all of our business lines with the vaccination rate increasing across the country we are anticipating accelerated growth in our RV and Marina businesses. We are well-positioned to see follow-through of this quarter's outperformance and look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming quarters. Karen will now discuss our financial results in more detail. Karen?\nKaren Dearing: Thanks, John. For the first quarter Sun reported core FFO per share of $1.26, 3.3% above the prior year and $0.09 ahead of the top end of our first quarter guidance range. During and subsequent to quarter end, we acquired $183 million of operating properties comprised of two manufactured home communities, six RV resorts and four Marinas. To support our growth activities we completed a $1.1 billion equity raise representing approximately 8 million shares of our common stock. To date we have settled 4 million shares receiving $538 million in net proceeds, which was used to pay down borrowings on our credit facility. We expect to settle the remaining 4 million shares no later than March 2022. We ended the first quarter with $4.4 billion of debt outstanding at a 3.4% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 9.5 years. As of March 31st, we had $105 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12 months recurring EBITDA ratio of 6.1 times. On a pro forma basis including the estimated full year EBITDA contribution from safe harbor and other acquisitions, our net that the trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio is in the low-five times. As a result of our out-performance during the quarter, we are raising our core FFO expectations for full year 2021 to a range of $5.92 to $6.08 per share. We expect core FFO for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.57 to $1.63 per share. We are also revising full year same community NOI growth guidance to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimate. As Gary mentioned earlier, we enhanced our financial disclosures this quarter. The addition of the Marina portfolio gave us the opportunity to re-envision how we report key aspects of our business. To provide more insight into each of our business lines we now have a same community schedule, which details performance by our MH and RV portfolio separately. Additionally, our same community revenues now include rental home program revenue and vacation rental home revenues, so the entire payment for these rentals is now included in real property revenue. Same community property operating expense now includes the related costs for these rental home programs. We are also netting all utility income against utility expense, which provides a better view on what Sun's direct utility costs are since the majority of these costs are passed through to our customers. We have retained our legacy disclosures for a rental program and have added a new page on the Marina portfolio. Please see the 2021 summary of reporting changes document, which is contained in the investor relations section of our website for additional information and an illustration of these changes. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. Gary, how does the current acquisition pipeline look, and where are you seeing the best opportunities?\nGary Shiffman: Good morning, Nick. As we've shared recently that current pipeline across manufactured housing, RV and marinas has never been as full as it is right now. I think that we're seeing a little bit more outreach than we even expected with some of the discussion about change in capital gains and things like that moving forward by the current administration, with obviously uncertainty as to where that's going. But we do believe that we match fund – match funded the right amount of capital to be able to go out and utilize that capital in the relatively near-term based on the pipeline throughout all three aspects of our business.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. I know guidance doesn't assume any acquisitions or funding, but as you think about funding that pipeline, do you use your line and then settle the equity toward the end, or do you plan to settle the equity as you go in terms of the acquisition volume?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. I think that's on a case-by-case basis. But for the foreseeable future, I think we rely on our line for certainty, quick access and the ability to close. One of the things that Sun is known for in such an acquisitive period and part of the reason why we had so many pocket listings, if you will, that don't go to the market is the fact that through our process of underwriting due diligence is to get through the purchase agreements and to work through tax deferred structuring and then finally to a rapid close would lead me to believe we would be utilizing the credit facility on our first basis and then fund off the forward from there.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.\nKeegan Carl: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I think first, inflation is obviously a big talking point. So are you guys seeing any inflation on new development and expansion projects? And if that's the case, is that impacting your plans in any way for the year?\nJohn McLaren: Maybe – this is John. Maybe a little bit, but no, it has had no impact on our plans for the year.\nKeegan Carl: Anything on labor, especially in the marina business, just given the specialization required?\nGary Shiffman: I think that one of the things that we did take a look at going into the budgeting process with the management team over at Safe Harbor is that we did allocate properly for minimum wage and pricing pressure on labor. So we feel pretty comfortable that all built into everything in the Safe Harbor budget, which we're very pleased that they were able to exceed this past quarter on strong growth drivers. There is no doubt on the material side for homebuilding, lumber, steel, other products have been under pricing pressure for over 12 to 18 months now. So, we're seeing small incremental price increases on the homes being delivered for our manufactured housing communities. But I think they are smaller in nature than what site build is experiencing right now and perhaps might continue to give us at Sun Communities a little bit of an edge against increases in the site build housing and make the manufactured housing even more obtainable and affordable to many customers out there. So, it could be a positive trend for us.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And just one more quick one. What were the cap rates from your two marina transactions? And are you guys seeing any further cap rate compression in the space?\nGary Shiffman: There is no doubt, there is continued competition in this space coming from private equity and even our public competitor who announced a small transaction this past quarter. But cap rates, for the time being it's a very unconsolidated industry, or governed by all the typical things of real estate, location, demand, sometimes quality of the ability to bolt-on to existing marinas in the Safe Harbor portfolio. So it's a range, and I would share that the manufactured housing and RV communities acquired since the beginning of the quarter, yes, probably average right around the 4.5% cap rate and the marinas have ranged 200 basis points to 250 basis points above that. So we continue to look for the marinas in the 6% to 9% cap rate range. And then, of course there's always exceptions when there is a very, very difficult replacement value set on a particular marina that might come down below that.\nKeegan Carl: Alright. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.\nGary Shiffman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the commentary that you had about the high level of advanced reservations that you've seen in the second quarter and the third quarter. I was noticing on the balance sheet that the category for advanced reservation deposits and rent is up really dramatically. So it was $188 million at the end of last year, its $280 million now. Is that reflective of the underlying strength? Are people reserving more in advance than they normally would be and that's driving that number higher? I'm just trying to get a feel of whether that large delta sort of represents the strength that you're seeing?\nKaren Dearing: There is a bit of impact from Safe Harbor and the seasonality of their portfolio and when they do their advanced billings, so there is around about $26 million to $30 million, I think, it's from Safe Harbor in there and the rest of it, I think is just the seasonality of our advanced reservations and deposits on our RV portfolio. I'm sure there is some impact from advanced reservations in there that what we're seeing. But it's more about seasonality and Safe Harbor.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, got it. Thanks for that. And then just talking about the guide. You all beat the original first quarter guide by $0.11 and the guide's up about $0.13. I'm just curious how much of the strength that you saw in the first quarter and that you're expecting for the second quarter is really being read into the full-year guide or if the portfolio continues to perform like it has, or like it did in the first quarter if you see more upside?\nKaren Dearing: I guess I would characterize the FFO raise, which I think is about $0.13 at the midpoint, that it reflects all the outperformance in Q1, plus additional expected outperformance in the transient RV business and if that – those offset – those increases are offset by the equity that we raised and have settled to date, which we will deploy into acquisitions as the year progresses.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nWes Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. I just want to look at the RV business. Are you seeing incremental strength on annual conversions right now?\nJohn McLaren: Yes, [indiscernible] I mean, we had a great first quarter with 380 plus – I think 387 was the exact number of conversions that we had, which as we've shared before, usually we're in the range of about 1,100 in the year, and so that number is a little bit elevated. There is a little bit of seasonality to it, but I think the way that I'd characterize is that I see us – I see a lot of strength going into that for the rest of the year as well. It all kind of goes back to everything we've talked about over the last year with – I call it the rediscovery of the outdoors. We've taken so many new guests into our communities, they discover our communities and that's really aiding in the conversion as well. So – and this is a reminder, every time we make, we have a conversion that's a 40% to 60% revenue pickup that we get in that year each time we do that. So very positive and very excited about the results we've had thus far.\nWes Golladay: Got it and then maybe can you discuss Campspot? You mentioned 60% of bookings; I believe come from that website or application. And can you give me, I guess, context of what that was maybe last year? And is that just Sun Communities or is that open to everybody?\nJohn McLaren: Great question. So Campspot was originally developed by our Northgate partners and it's jointly on the Sun and Northgate and it's, as I said in my remarks, it's a revenue management system coupled with its proprietary reservation system. And I think that the – the thing that's most interesting about it is each resort in our portfolio really represents a multi-faceted occupancy and rate equation, literally each and every day of the year and at the core of Campspot is a built-in algorithm the optimizes the rate occupancy equation in the most efficient way. So that's been some of the driving force behind aiding through 2020 and really brought us back as well as what's happening in 2021, it's been a big contributor. And if you go back to, I think, we said two years ago, our online reservation book; it was about 62% [ph] versus 60% it is today. So there are other users of Campspot through the OTA, but it's – certainly, our entire portfolio is on it now, just awesome.\nGary Shiffman: That's being marketed across the country right now. So we're pretty excited to see how it performs for everybody.\nJohn McLaren: Yes.\nWes Golladay: Yes. Got it and then, maybe just one on the development in San Diego. Is that going to deliver negative NOI this year or positive? And when will stabilization be? And when you do set a stabilized yield, does that include the benefit of selling homes?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. So the resort Sun Outdoors San Diego Bay, that is an RV resort. It's got RV sites and vacation rentals. And typically on an RV ground-up development, we would see stabilization within a three-year period of time. And one of the benefits of the RV development is we can accept guests and we already are. In fact, I'm heading out there on Monday night for the official grand opening on the [indiscernible] that we've worked with for close to four years on and it will generate positive NOI in 2021.\nWes Golladay: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the inflation conversation, but more on the demand side. John, the – as the price of other housing alternatives kind of skyrocketed in certain markets, are there any regions where you think you'd maybe second guess or pivot the typical 2% to 4% rent increase policy you've had? Is there – are there any markets where you'd push rents 5%, 6%, 7% in the coming years you think?\nJohn McLaren: Well, for 20-plus years we've always, as you know, Todd, stated in that 2% to 4% range on average across the portfolio. But it's not to say that in certain markets where a higher rent increase can be achieved. We do. We always try to keep everything from – we are in the attainable, affordable housing business and we take a very long-term view on that within the portfolio because there are so many benefits that come with sort of having the rent increases at the right level, okay, inclusive of the kind of equity growth that we're seeing across our broker sales in our communities, which is real value to the customers, as well as real value to our portfolio overall. So to answer your question, some might be above that range and then we certainly would look to places, areas in the country that have more strength where that typically would happen.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Great, thanks. And then last one for me, Gary. Just in terms of the acquisition mix in recent years tilted considerably toward RV and not as active on the traditional MH side, is that more of an indication of just more RV volume hitting the market or is an indication where more times than not a traditional MH acquisition no longer pencils for you?\nGary Shiffman: Yes, I think it's the former, definitely not the latter. The consolidation sequence in chronology is that manufactured housing became a prized asset way before RV resorts were really understood. So, as you may recall, there were four public companies. And now there are – actually five and now there are three, Sun, ELS and UMI. And I think that it's just a factor of the scarcity of available manufactured housing communities out there. And then following that sequence, I'd like to give credit to the Sun team for really taking a deep dive into the RV business and understanding how it grew over the last 20 years, and then strategically determining that we were going to increase our RV Holdings in Sun's portfolio and in doing so, kind of looked at cap rates in RV very similar to manufactured housing because we determine the revenues, the NOI growth was just a steady and, in some case, a stronger than what we saw in manufactured housing. So as we followed and pursued aggressively acquisitions in RVs, that asset class has begun to consolidate. And then as you follow that even further into marinas, as many of you are aware, there was recapitalization and restructuring at Sunteck, the second largest marina holder and another portfolio – small portfolio acquired by ELS. So while there is absolutely opportunity for Sun and MH, RV, marinas right now are beginning to garner interest by other investors. And I anticipate we'll see some pressure on cap rates, but as I indicated earlier that we are able to buy them and acquire them in a 250 basis points and above spread to MH and RV. So, there is occasionally manufactured housing that we won't pursue to the levels that they're being acquired, but for the most part, what we're seeing and what we're acquiring isn't broadly marketed, it's just a phone call into our acquisitions department or personal relationship from someone on the team here reaching out.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you, and thanks for the increased disclosure. I was wondering on the increase in RV demand you're seeing this year, how much of that do you think is a temporary phenomenon and will receive potentially next year when people feel more comfortable flying and going increases?\nJohn McLaren: Yes, good question, John. Definitely, COVID has been a part of that, but really, the prospects for both RV and marina growth have never been stronger. I think as I said a couple of times that the notable thing is just rediscovery that's happened is really – I mean we saw particularly in the fall, okay, which was the growth like we've never seen in the fall. And what we saw during that time, many, many of those guests rebook, okay, into other parts of the year as well. The other thing that provides some strength with the two is that the vast majority of our visitors and our guests that come to our resorts are coming within a 90-mile radius. So naturally, it will be some moving back to other forms of travel on vacation. But we will retain many of the new guests because of the experience they had in 2020 and the point with the radius that we have for most of our guests to come to our communities that even if they do go back to other forms of travel, it's an easy and affordable vacation they can take, that's something they can do on the weekend, or we can add it on. So it's sort of it – it can be sort of an add-on even if they go back.\nGary Shiffman: Yeah, John, I would add to John's remarks that I think what we're looking for is the incremental residual impact. So, we won't retain everybody, but I can share with you that we will retain a residual portion of the increased demand as a result of the experience out there that has been positive. So I think it bodes well for incremental growth on what we would naturally expect in the RV resort business.\nJohn Kim: And what do you think is the best leading indicator for that demand? Is it RV shipment, which has increased significantly this past month? I think historically, it hasn't really been a high correlation between shipments and your occupancy, but I'm just wondering what your thoughts were on this?\nGary Shiffman: Okay. Well, you asked for it. So here it is. I think the best indicator is anecdotal indication of this individual myself and my family taking several COVID RV property inspections and vacations and what a great time we had. And that's pretty much echoed by even some people on this analyst call who have shared their experiences with us. But as we continue to do our exit surveys, we're just finding the enjoyment that John referenced as the leading indicator of why we think that it will be this residual increase post COVID to our business. And there are estimated to be around 11 million RVs registered today. There are new options to be able to ramp existing RVs on an Airbnb model out there, so just continue to see increase in the consumer or guest pool available for a very limited amount of RV resorts. And I always like to point out to that the RV resorts are generally about being able to have the utility hookups, sewer water electric as opposed to boondocking where you don't have those hookups and then the amenities and the features related to those RV resorts. So we just think that it's a very, very exciting time in the RV business to be part of its growth.\nJohn Kim: I would love to ask the same question on superyacht demand. Maybe I'll see that for a separate discussion.\nGary Shiffman: I would like to tell you, I've been on the superyachts, but it hasn't happened yet. I was on electric boat, however, and it's quite fascinating to get a glimpse of what the future might be with regard to moving from fossil fuel in the boating business to some expanded research and development and actually offerings now in electronic – electric boats battery powered.\nJohn Kim: Separate topic, with all the acquisition activity you've had in the past few years, can you just remind us what percentage of institutional quality image communities and RV parks you currently on?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah, it's Gary again, and unfortunately, there is not a national repository of information or indexes and the related items to manufactured housing communities as you're referencing them. I would suggest that the vast majority of institutional quality manufactured housing communities have been consolidated by the public companies and what we referenced the three or four other high-quality private companies that are out there today with the best-in-class portfolios. So, I would not be able to necessarily give you a percentage, but I've heard from our competitors that probably represents anywhere from 10% to 15% of overall manufactured housing and RV resorts and probably closer to 50% of what we would consider institutional quality.\nJohn Kim: Okay, that's helpful. And then my final question is on your rental home business, which had strong rental growth, but it's coming down its proportion of your real property revenue on a year-over-year basis. Do you have any views or updated views on potentially increasing this business, given the strength of the single-family rental market?\nJohn McLaren: Yeah, absolutely. I mean our rental home program, as you know, has stood the test of time. It's an excellent tool to accelerate occupancy revenue growth. So, we will continue to use it as we share for expansions, new development and acquisitions for lease-up, ultimately, converting renters into homeowners. That would be the strategy though, John, okay to use it going forward and have and kind of align with the acquisitions and the development that we do along the way to move that forward faster.\nJohn Kim: Got it. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey, Gary, John and Karen. Hope you're doing well. Just wanted to touch base on John's comments in the opening remarks about how Safe Harbor portfolios doing better than your underwriting. What's driving that? Is it like something on the revenue side, expense side or something else, just curious?\nGary Shiffman: That's a great question, Josh. And what I would probably suggest what we've seen as we reviewed performance against budget is key first quarter drivers are revenue growth in Florida on the East Coast and in the southern portion of the portfolio. Again, strong demand, limited supply as we look what's really taking place in the portfolio. We're seeing rate growth pretty much in line with budget, but we're seeing increase in demand and occupancy, and most notably, what we're seeing is summer marina expectations that are a little bit ahead of where regions were last year. So baked into our guidance or part of our guidance is expecting continued good solid growth in the marina business. So, it's no one thing, just demand. I think we talked about it a lot, escaping the monotony and challenges of the COVID environment, getting out into the fresh air, enjoying being on the boats, on the water, those types of things like we're seeing in the RV are very, very similar.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I hear you. I can't wait to get back out there.\nGary Shiffman: We know you like your boat. Question is, do you like your marina?\nJoshua Dennerlein: I'll go and check out. I was at Safe Harbors for a few years, but this year, I could, just I was on the Vineyard. I tried getting into Prime, they won't let me in. That maybe next summer. That's it for me for questions.\nGary Shiffman: Thanks, Josh.\nKaren Dearing: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Stender: Hi, thanks. Just looking at new home sales, on average, they're exceeding $150,000. What's the highest price point that you see on new homes and what's the square footage on something like that?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. So our highest price point is going to be in our Colorado, our new development, River Run in Colorado as well as what we're doing down in the [indiscernible]. And that's going to push above $300,000. But again, I think the important thing to note when you're talking about $300,000 on manufactured home, that is on a relative basis very affordable in the environment, which sits in the location where...\nTodd Stender: Those price points – are buyers financing them? I guess, we're kind of used to seeing most of cash buyers, but maybe any comments regarding the increasing financing as these price points just edge higher?\nJohn McLaren: Yeah, at those price points, Todd, it's generally a cash buyer that's coming in for those. Usually, 90% are cash, or they go to a local bank.\nTodd Stender: Got it. Okay. Maybe for Karen, just kind of switching to the balance sheet with debt to EBITDA right around 6 times, just for modeling purposes and looking at the forward equity, is it fair to assume a 1 million shares at a clip for the next four quarters, or is that feature call for all 4 million shares at once?\nKaren Dearing: No, the feature doesn't call for all 4 million shares at once. And I think we'll draw on the line as Gary suggested initially for acquisitions, and then we will shortly thereafter match fund with the acquisition volume that we're doing.\nTodd Stender: And then so on a pro forma basis, do you have a debt to EBITDA, assuming the forward equity?\nKaren Dearing: Without the forward equity, we are going to be at low 5 times. I think with the forward equity, we will be below.\nTodd Stender: Okay. And then on the debt side, just for modeling, what kind of debt are you looking at right now in any coupon or duration you could share?\nKaren Dearing: We really have no maturities from a debt basis. We have been very, very active on refinancing debt. So, there's really nothing to refinance on the debt side from – for this year and little for next year. I would say, a typical 10-year money at 65% is in the 2.5% to 3.5% for the GSEs and life companies. Also we do take a look at – we do evaluate unsecured borrowing. At this time, with the Company's increased size and capital needs, look at that unsecured market makes more sense than what we've done in the past. So we are currently evaluating the unsecured market.\nTodd Stender: Got it. Last one, probably for John, the San Diego RV development. Are there more sites coming in addition to the 250 that were just completed?\nJohn McLaren: Potentially. We are looking at another 90 sites that we can add to that, Todd.\nTodd Stender: Great, thank you.\nJohn McLaren: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSamir Khanal: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. So I guess, John or Karen. When you look at the marina business, what's the right NOI margin to think about? When I just did the math here, I mean, it looked a bit light in the quarter. And again, I know it's possibly due to seasonality here, but just maybe going back, the last few years with Safe Harbor, what's been the trend for NOI margin for marinas?\nKaren Dearing: So, Sameer, I think your comment regarding seasonality in Q4 – I mean, Q1 is accurate and typically you'd see all-in margins on the marina business, the high-30%s, still low-40%.\nSamir Khanal: Okay, got it. And I guess, just remind me and if I missed this, I apologize, but did you update the marina guidance for NOI, $163 million to $169 million that you provided last quarter?\nKaren Dearing: No, we did not update the marina guidance.\nSamir Khanal: And if you're trending sort of in the high kind of in the $31 million, which your commentary sort of suggests that you're kind of trending higher on the marina side, is it fair to assume that you're tracking kind of ahead of that was $163 million to $169 million at this point?\nKaren Dearing: I would say we're in line with our expectations, likely into the high-end and it has been – that outperformance has been included in our FFO guidance.\nSamir Khanal: Got it. And my final question is on the expense side. I did not see a breakdown this quarter for the various line items. I mean, how are you trending on maybe operating expenses and how are you thinking about maybe for the remainder of the year for those line items?\nKaren Dearing: Well, that's a tough one because of the COVID impact, right. So the comparatives for the prior year are – I'll use a sort of technical term, very wonky. So that expense increases you will see higher on that comparative basis. But for the quarter, what we saw was an increase. I mean, lower-than-expected expenses for utilities and also for advertising and I expect some of those advertising costs to shift into future quarters.\nSamir Khanal: Okay, got it. All right. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. Maybe, Karen, could you just break out the full-year NOI growth guidance in between revenue and expense?\nKaren Dearing: Yeah, I don't – we haven't – we have not presented that previously, John. So I'm going to decline to respond.\nJohn Pawlowski: All right. Take care.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nGary Shiffman: Well, we thank you all for participating on the call and all of us are available for any follow-up and we look forward to getting together with everybody after second quarter is complete. Thank you, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Karen Dearing",
            "content": "Thanks, John. For the first quarter Sun reported core FFO per share of $1.26, 3.3% above the prior year and $0.09 ahead of the top end of our first quarter guidance range. During and subsequent to quarter end, we acquired $183 million of operating properties comprised of two manufactured home communities, six RV resorts and four Marinas. To support our growth activities we completed a $1.1 billion equity raise representing approximately 8 million shares of our common stock. To date we have settled 4 million shares receiving $538 million in net proceeds, which was used to pay down borrowings on our credit facility. We expect to settle the remaining 4 million shares no later than March 2022. We ended the first quarter with $4.4 billion of debt outstanding at a 3.4% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 9.5 years. As of March 31st, we had $105 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12 months recurring EBITDA ratio of 6.1 times. On a pro forma basis including the estimated full year EBITDA contribution from safe harbor and other acquisitions, our net that the trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio is in the low-five times. As a result of our out-performance during the quarter, we are raising our core FFO expectations for full year 2021 to a range of $5.92 to $6.08 per share. We expect core FFO for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.57 to $1.63 per share. We are also revising full year same community NOI growth guidance to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimate. As Gary mentioned earlier, we enhanced our financial disclosures this quarter. The addition of the Marina portfolio gave us the opportunity to re-envision how we report key aspects of our business. To provide more insight into each of our business lines we now have a same community schedule, which details performance by our MH and RV portfolio separately. Additionally, our same community revenues now include rental home program revenue and vacation rental home revenues, so the entire payment for these rentals is now included in real property revenue. Same community property operating expense now includes the related costs for these rental home programs. We are also netting all utility income against utility expense, which provides a better view on what Sun's direct utility costs are since the majority of these costs are passed through to our customers. We have retained our legacy disclosures for a rental program and have added a new page on the Marina portfolio. Please see the 2021 summary of reporting changes document, which is contained in the investor relations section of our website for additional information and an illustration of these changes. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator? There is a bit of impact from Safe Harbor and the seasonality of their portfolio and when they do their advanced billings, so there is around about $26 million to $30 million, I think, it's from Safe Harbor in there and the rest of it, I think is just the seasonality of our advanced reservations and deposits on our RV portfolio. I'm sure there is some impact from advanced reservations in there that what we're seeing. But it's more about seasonality and Safe Harbor. I guess I would characterize the FFO raise, which I think is about $0.13 at the midpoint, that it reflects all the outperformance in Q1, plus additional expected outperformance in the transient RV business and if that – those offset – those increases are offset by the equity that we raised and have settled to date, which we will deploy into acquisitions as the year progresses. Thanks, Josh. No, the feature doesn't call for all 4 million shares at once. And I think we'll draw on the line as Gary suggested initially for acquisitions, and then we will shortly thereafter match fund with the acquisition volume that we're doing. Without the forward equity, we are going to be at low 5 times. I think with the forward equity, we will be below. We really have no maturities from a debt basis. We have been very, very active on refinancing debt. So, there's really nothing to refinance on the debt side from – for this year and little for next year. I would say, a typical 10-year money at 65% is in the 2.5% to 3.5% for the GSEs and life companies. Also we do take a look at – we do evaluate unsecured borrowing. At this time, with the Company's increased size and capital needs, look at that unsecured market makes more sense than what we've done in the past. So we are currently evaluating the unsecured market. So, Sameer, I think your comment regarding seasonality in Q4 – I mean, Q1 is accurate and typically you'd see all-in margins on the marina business, the high-30%s, still low-40%. No, we did not update the marina guidance. I would say we're in line with our expectations, likely into the high-end and it has been – that outperformance has been included in our FFO guidance. Well, that's a tough one because of the COVID impact, right. So the comparatives for the prior year are – I'll use a sort of technical term, very wonky. So that expense increases you will see higher on that comparative basis. But for the quarter, what we saw was an increase.

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us as we discuss our first quarter 2021 results. We're very pleased with the performance of all of our business lines as 2021 is off to a very strong start. In the first quarter, we delivered core FFO per share of $1.26, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of $1.17. Due to this outperformance and strong visibility into our second and third quarter transient RV bookings, we are raising our 2021 core FFO per share annual guidance range by $0.13 to $5.92 to $6.08 and our expected same community NOI growth for the full year by 190 basis points to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%. The momentum we experienced in our RV resorts in 2020 has only accelerated this year as the country continues to reopen. For the quarter, same community NOI growth was 2.7% over last year, despite the continued Canadian border closure and the California stay-at-home order which dictated the closure of our California resorts through early February. We achieved total portfolio occupancy of 97.3%, a 60 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2020 by selling 514 revenue-producing sites. We also delivered approximately 350 ground-up and expansion sites in the first quarter, which include the grand opening of our premier 250 site Sun Outdoors San Diego Bay Resort. Since the beginning of the year, we have deployed $183 million into acquisitions, comprised of two manufactured housing communities, six RV resorts, and four marinas. Our team continues to find ways to add irreplaceable assets to our portfolio that serve to reinforce the high quality of our brand, enhance our offerings to our guests and foster continued growth of our revenues and earnings over time. In our manufactured housing business, our operations are benefiting from sustained strength and fundamentals and demand for affordable housing, evidenced by new, pre-owned, and brokered home sales. Furthermore, applications to live in a Sun community remain at record high levels, up 21% over this time last year. Our RV business, while impacted by the closures and the travel restrictions associated with the pandemic during the quarter, is showing resilience with forward bookings well ahead of both 2020 and 2019. As we emerge from the pandemic and as the percentage of the vaccinated population rises, we anticipate our best-in-class resorts to remain a preferred vacationing option. Our assertion is supported by the RV Industry Association stating record-year unit sale expectations for 2021 as well as our strong advance bookings for the second and third quarters. A broader segment of the population rediscovered the outdoors during 2020 and we are seeing that interest carry forward. In an environment impacted by COVID, RV provides travelers with an incremental level of safety and control. Moreover, we believe that increased demand is being driven by the continued desire of consumers to get back to a degree of normalcy, resuming vacation and leisure travel after last year's travel restrictions. In our marina business, results continue to track ahead of our underwriting and the team is preparing for an active boating season. According to multiple industry sources, boat sales have increased in demand year-over-year. With our expanded presence in this sought-after and scarce asset class, we are well-positioned to benefit from the increased demand for slips and moorings. We are relying on our four core investment strategies to support long-term resilience and the growth of our platform, further solidifying our position of delivering industry-leading results. An important part of these core strategies includes expansion and ground-up development. We wanted to highlight the recent opening of Sun Outdoors San Diego Bay first announced nearly four years ago. It is now open for guests and we are pleased to continue to realize meaningful accretion from our capital deployment activities. In early March, we executed a $1.1 billion equity raise to secure capital to fund our growing acquisition pipeline and other opportunities. We will match fund these growth initiatives with this equity. Key contributors to the success of our franchise are our ongoing efforts with regard to our environment and its sustainability, our social ecosystem and careful attention to governance. With that said, we wanted to provide some important updates with regard to our ESG initiatives. This month, we launched a new partnership with the National Park Foundation in support of the foundation's outdoor exploration program. Sun RV resorts has committed to contribute toward the National Park Foundation's mission to connect this and future generations with the social, mental and physical health benefits of national parks and outdoor discovery. With respect to our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, Sun has engaged with a consultancy team with 30 years of experience in the field of equality and justice. This group has deep expertise in the importance of breaking through unconscious bias and social injustices in the workplace. Together, we are assessing the current state of inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility at Sun, and developing an organization wide strategy to create positive change. Before handing the call over to John and Karen, I wanted to point out that we have enhanced our financial disclosures. With the addition of Safe Harbor, we took the opportunity to provide better insight into the primary drivers of our business. Karen will walk you through the changes we have implemented after John shares details about our operational performance. I will now turn the call over to John. John? Good morning, Nick. As we've shared recently that current pipeline across manufactured housing, RV and marinas has never been as full as it is right now. I think that we're seeing a little bit more outreach than we even expected with some of the discussion about change in capital gains and things like that moving forward by the current administration, with obviously uncertainty as to where that's going. But we do believe that we match fund – match funded the right amount of capital to be able to go out and utilize that capital in the relatively near-term based on the pipeline throughout all three aspects of our business. Yes. I think that's on a case-by-case basis. But for the foreseeable future, I think we rely on our line for certainty, quick access and the ability to close. One of the things that Sun is known for in such an acquisitive period and part of the reason why we had so many pocket listings, if you will, that don't go to the market is the fact that through our process of underwriting due diligence is to get through the purchase agreements and to work through tax deferred structuring and then finally to a rapid close would lead me to believe we would be utilizing the credit facility on our first basis and then fund off the forward from there. I think that one of the things that we did take a look at going into the budgeting process with the management team over at Safe Harbor is that we did allocate properly for minimum wage and pricing pressure on labor. So we feel pretty comfortable that all built into everything in the Safe Harbor budget, which we're very pleased that they were able to exceed this past quarter on strong growth drivers. There is no doubt on the material side for homebuilding, lumber, steel, other products have been under pricing pressure for over 12 to 18 months now. So, we're seeing small incremental price increases on the homes being delivered for our manufactured housing communities. But I think they are smaller in nature than what site build is experiencing right now and perhaps might continue to give us at Sun Communities a little bit of an edge against increases in the site build housing and make the manufactured housing even more obtainable and affordable to many customers out there. So, it could be a positive trend for us. There is no doubt, there is continued competition in this space coming from private equity and even our public competitor who announced a small transaction this past quarter. But cap rates, for the time being it's a very unconsolidated industry, or governed by all the typical things of real estate, location, demand, sometimes quality of the ability to bolt-on to existing marinas in the Safe Harbor portfolio. So it's a range, and I would share that the manufactured housing and RV communities acquired since the beginning of the quarter, yes, probably average right around the 4.5% cap rate and the marinas have ranged 200 basis points to 250 basis points above that. So we continue to look for the marinas in the 6% to 9% cap rate range. And then, of course there's always exceptions when there is a very, very difficult replacement value set on a particular marina that might come down below that. Thank you. That's being marketed across the country right now. So we're pretty excited to see how it performs for everybody. Yes. So the resort Sun Outdoors San Diego Bay, that is an RV resort. It's got RV sites and vacation rentals. And typically on an RV ground-up development, we would see stabilization within a three-year period of time. And one of the benefits of the RV development is we can accept guests and we already are. In fact, I'm heading out there on Monday night for the official grand opening on the [indiscernible] that we've worked with for close to four years on and it will generate positive NOI in 2021. Yes, I think it's the former, definitely not the latter. The consolidation sequence in chronology is that manufactured housing became a prized asset way before RV resorts were really understood. So, as you may recall, there were four public companies. And now there are – actually five and now there are three, Sun, ELS and UMI. And I think that it's just a factor of the scarcity of available manufactured housing communities out there. And then following that sequence, I'd like to give credit to the Sun team for really taking a deep dive into the RV business and understanding how it grew over the last 20 years, and then strategically determining that we were going to increase our RV Holdings in Sun's portfolio and in doing so, kind of looked at cap rates in RV very similar to manufactured housing because we determine the revenues, the NOI growth was just a steady and, in some case, a stronger than what we saw in manufactured housing. So as we followed and pursued aggressively acquisitions in RVs, that asset class has begun to consolidate. And then as you follow that even further into marinas, as many of you are aware, there was recapitalization and restructuring at Sunteck, the second largest marina holder and another portfolio – small portfolio acquired by ELS. So while there is absolutely opportunity for Sun and MH, RV, marinas right now are beginning to garner interest by other investors. And I anticipate we'll see some pressure on cap rates, but as I indicated earlier that we are able to buy them and acquire them in a 250 basis points and above spread to MH and RV. So, there is occasionally manufactured housing that we won't pursue to the levels that they're being acquired, but for the most part, what we're seeing and what we're acquiring isn't broadly marketed, it's just a phone call into our acquisitions department or personal relationship from someone on the team here reaching out. Yeah, John, I would add to John's remarks that I think what we're looking for is the incremental residual impact. So, we won't retain everybody, but I can share with you that we will retain a residual portion of the increased demand as a result of the experience out there that has been positive. So I think it bodes well for incremental growth on what we would naturally expect in the RV resort business. Okay. Well, you asked for it. So here it is. I think the best indicator is anecdotal indication of this individual myself and my family taking several COVID RV property inspections and vacations and what a great time we had. And that's pretty much echoed by even some people on this analyst call who have shared their experiences with us. But as we continue to do our exit surveys, we're just finding the enjoyment that John referenced as the leading indicator of why we think that it will be this residual increase post COVID to our business. And there are estimated to be around 11 million RVs registered today. There are new options to be able to ramp existing RVs on an Airbnb model out there, so just continue to see increase in the consumer or guest pool available for a very limited amount of RV resorts. And I always like to point out to that the RV resorts are generally about being able to have the utility hookups, sewer water electric as opposed to boondocking where you don't have those hookups and then the amenities and the features related to those RV resorts. So we just think that it's a very, very exciting time in the RV business to be part of its growth. I would like to tell you, I've been on the superyachts, but it hasn't happened yet. I was on electric boat, however, and it's quite fascinating to get a glimpse of what the future might be with regard to moving from fossil fuel in the boating business to some expanded research and development and actually offerings now in electronic – electric boats battery powered. Yeah, it's Gary again, and unfortunately, there is not a national repository of information or indexes and the related items to manufactured housing communities as you're referencing them. I would suggest that the vast majority of institutional quality manufactured housing communities have been consolidated by the public companies and what we referenced the three or four other high-quality private companies that are out there today with the best-in-class portfolios. So, I would not be able to necessarily give you a percentage, but I've heard from our competitors that probably represents anywhere from 10% to 15% of overall manufactured housing and RV resorts and probably closer to 50% of what we would consider institutional quality. That's a great question, Josh. And what I would probably suggest what we've seen as we reviewed performance against budget is key first quarter drivers are revenue growth in Florida on the East Coast and in the southern portion of the portfolio. Again, strong demand, limited supply as we look what's really taking place in the portfolio. We're seeing rate growth pretty much in line with budget, but we're seeing increase in demand and occupancy, and most notably, what we're seeing is summer marina expectations that are a little bit ahead of where regions were last year. So baked into our guidance or part of our guidance is expecting continued good solid growth in the marina business. So, it's no one thing, just demand. I think we talked about it a lot, escaping the monotony and challenges of the COVID environment, getting out into the fresh air, enjoying being on the boats, on the water, those types of things like we're seeing in the RV are very, very similar. We know you like your boat. Question is, do you like your marina? Thanks, Josh. Yes. So our highest price point is going to be in our Colorado, our new development, River Run in Colorado as well as what we're doing down in the [indiscernible]. And that's going to push above $300,000. But again, I think the important thing to note when you're talking about $300,000 on manufactured home, that is on a relative basis very affordable in the environment, which sits in the location where... Well, we thank you all for participating on the call and all of us are available for any follow-up and we look forward to getting together with everybody after second quarter is complete. Thank you, operator."

            "name": "John McLaren",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Sun delivered a strong first quarter across the board, setting the stage for a solid year. Our results reflect the combination of the stability of our manufactured housing business line and our same community portfolio, as well as the incremental benefits of our growth initiatives across MH, RV, and marina business lines. For the first quarter, combined same community NOI increased 2.7%. The growth in NOI was driven by a 3.5% revenue gain, supported by a 1.9% increase in occupancy to 98.8% and a 3.5 weighted average rent increase. This was offset by a 5.5% expense increase. As part of our revised disclosures we are now providing same community NOI for our manufactured housing and RV businesses. Same community manufactured housing NOI increased by 4.9% from 2020 and same community RV NOI declined by 4%. RV revenues were impacted by the Canadian border closure during the first quarter, which affected our snowboard season in the California shelter-inplace order that ran through early February. Combined these two events had a $6 million impact on our transient RV same community revenue as compared to our previously communicated estimate of $8 million to $10 million. With respect to RV revenue, we anticipate a significant rebound in the second and third quarters. RV resorts are beneficiaries of the reopening trade and we are fully participating. Our second quarter transient forecast is already ahead of our original budget by over 20% and trending 57% higher than 2019, which we believe to be a better comparable given COVID related disruptions in 2020. Likewise, our third quarter transient RV forecast is currently ahead of the original budget by approximately 5%, and this trending ahead of 2019 by almost 40%. In addition, we have a great deal of visibility into our reservations the rest of the year through Campspot, our proprietary RV reservation and revenue management software. Today digital reservations comprise over 60% of our total reservations for our same community portfolio as compared to 60%, just two years ago. Moving on to total MH and RV portfolio, in the first quarter we gained 514 revenue producing sites as compared to 300 in the first quarter of 2020, bringing our total portfolio occupancy to 97.3% from 96.7% a year ago. Of our revenue producing site gains over 380 transient RV sites were converted to annual leases with the balance being added in our manufactured housing expansion communities. A key component of our four core growth initiatives is the development of ground-up and expansion sites. In the first quarter we delivered approximately 350 sites, 250 of which in the ground-up development in San Diego and 100 were an MH expansion sites at Sunset Ridge in Texas. These complete expansion and ground-up development sites will contribute to RPS gains in 2021 and beyond, as they fill up and stabilize. As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately 9,700 zone and entitled sites in our portfolio that once built will contribute to growth in the coming years. Home sales in the quarter were particularly strong. We sold 835 homes, an increase of 9.4% versus the first quarter of 2020, of these 149 where new home sales, up over 25% and 686 were pre-owned home sales, up 6.5% as compared to the same period last year, respectively. Average home prices for both new and pre-owned homes rose 17.6% and 9.8% respectively underscoring the overall geographic market mix, as well as sustained demand for our product and the strong desire to live in a Sun Communities. Brokered home sales throughout Sun's portfolio saw 36% increase year-over-year as the resale market continues to show strength. Average brokered home prices in our communities increased by over 20% as compared to the first quarter of 2020. We believe that a vibrant resell market for homes in our communities demonstrates the benefits of the consistent reinvestment in our properties, creating equity value for our homeowners and increasing the overall value of our portfolio. Moving on to safe harbor; during the quarter the Marina portfolio contributed over $31.4 million to total NOI. The Marinas are performing ahead of our underwriting and the team continues to source acquisitions in irreplaceable locations, which for the first quarter include two Marinas on Islamorada and the Florida Keys, and two Marinas on Martha's Vineyard. We are optimistic about the underlying trends we are observing across all of our business lines with the vaccination rate increasing across the country we are anticipating accelerated growth in our RV and Marina businesses. We are well-positioned to see follow-through of this quarter's outperformance and look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming quarters. Karen will now discuss our financial results in more detail. Karen? Maybe – this is John. Maybe a little bit, but no, it has had no impact on our plans for the year. Yes, [indiscernible] I mean, we had a great first quarter with 380 plus – I think 387 was the exact number of conversions that we had, which as we've shared before, usually we're in the range of about 1,100 in the year, and so that number is a little bit elevated. There is a little bit of seasonality to it, but I think the way that I'd characterize is that I see us – I see a lot of strength going into that for the rest of the year as well. It all kind of goes back to everything we've talked about over the last year with – I call it the rediscovery of the outdoors. We've taken so many new guests into our communities, they discover our communities and that's really aiding in the conversion as well. So – and this is a reminder, every time we make, we have a conversion that's a 40% to 60% revenue pickup that we get in that year each time we do that. So very positive and very excited about the results we've had thus far. Great question. So Campspot was originally developed by our Northgate partners and it's jointly on the Sun and Northgate and it's, as I said in my remarks, it's a revenue management system coupled with its proprietary reservation system. And I think that the – the thing that's most interesting about it is each resort in our portfolio really represents a multi-faceted occupancy and rate equation, literally each and every day of the year and at the core of Campspot is a built-in algorithm the optimizes the rate occupancy equation in the most efficient way. So that's been some of the driving force behind aiding through 2020 and really brought us back as well as what's happening in 2021, it's been a big contributor. And if you go back to, I think, we said two years ago, our online reservation book; it was about 62% [ph] versus 60% it is today. So there are other users of Campspot through the OTA, but it's – certainly, our entire portfolio is on it now, just awesome. Yes. Well, for 20-plus years we've always, as you know, Todd, stated in that 2% to 4% range on average across the portfolio. But it's not to say that in certain markets where a higher rent increase can be achieved. We do. We always try to keep everything from – we are in the attainable, affordable housing business and we take a very long-term view on that within the portfolio because there are so many benefits that come with sort of having the rent increases at the right level, okay, inclusive of the kind of equity growth that we're seeing across our broker sales in our communities, which is real value to the customers, as well as real value to our portfolio overall. So to answer your question, some might be above that range and then we certainly would look to places, areas in the country that have more strength where that typically would happen. Yes, good question, John. Definitely, COVID has been a part of that, but really, the prospects for both RV and marina growth have never been stronger. I think as I said a couple of times that the notable thing is just rediscovery that's happened is really – I mean we saw particularly in the fall, okay, which was the growth like we've never seen in the fall. And what we saw during that time, many, many of those guests rebook, okay, into other parts of the year as well. The other thing that provides some strength with the two is that the vast majority of our visitors and our guests that come to our resorts are coming within a 90-mile radius. So naturally, it will be some moving back to other forms of travel on vacation. But we will retain many of the new guests because of the experience they had in 2020 and the point with the radius that we have for most of our guests to come to our communities that even if they do go back to other forms of travel, it's an easy and affordable vacation they can take, that's something they can do on the weekend, or we can add it on. So it's sort of it – it can be sort of an add-on even if they go back. Yeah, absolutely. I mean our rental home program, as you know, has stood the test of time. It's an excellent tool to accelerate occupancy revenue growth. So, we will continue to use it as we share for expansions, new development and acquisitions for lease-up, ultimately, converting renters into homeowners. That would be the strategy though, John, okay to use it going forward and have and kind of align with the acquisitions and the development that we do along the way to move that forward faster. Yeah, at those price points, Todd, it's generally a cash buyer that's coming in for those. Usually, 90% are cash, or they go to a local bank. Potentially. We are looking at another 90 sites that we can add to that, Todd. Thank you."

At this time, management would like me to inform you that certain statements made during this call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can provide no assurance that these expectations will be achieved. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in yesterday's press release and, from time to time, in the company's periodic filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to advise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release. Having said that, I would like to introduce management with us today: Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; John McLaren, Strategic Adviser; and Fernando Castro-Caratini, Chief Financial Officer. After their remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, management asks that you limit yourself to two questions, so everyone who would like to participate has ample opportunity. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss fourth quarter and full year results for 2022 and our guidance for 2023. This year marks Sun's 30th year as a public company. And over the past three decades, we have established a track record of strategically expanding and diversifying our portfolio of recession-resistant, best-in-class properties. We and our stakeholders have benefited from the compelling supply and demand dynamics that underpin manufactured housing, RV communities and marinas. Our strategic approach has delivered an attractive balance of a reliable organic growth and strong FFO per share increases. We have increased rents throughout economic cycles, and our strong results for 2022 and outlook for Same Property NOI growth in 2023 demonstrates the benefits of operating in segments where supply is perpetually constrained and demand is resilient. In 2022, core FFO per share grew 12.9%, driven by strong demand for our offerings as well as our accretive investment activity. Demand for our manufactured housing communities and RV locations is evident in our consistently high occupancy levels, gains in revenue-producing sites and solid Same Property NOI growth. At year-end, our combined MH and RV occupancy was nearly 97%, reflecting approximately 96% occupancy within our manufactured housing portfolio. During the year, we achieved a record of over 2,900 revenue-producing site gains, driven by more than 2,250 conversions of transient RV sites to annual leases, which topped last year's record conversions of nearly 1,700 sites and represented a 36% year-over-year increase. In marinas, our 2022 Same Property results continue to demonstrate supply-demand tailwinds, with a 12:1 ratio of registered boats in the U.S. to the existing supply of leasable wet slips and dry storage spaces. This creates a very sticky customer base and gives us the ability to grow rents. The resilience of our platform can be seen in our full year total manufactured housing, RV and marina Same Property NOI results, which grew by 5.8% over 2021. With regard to external growth, since acquiring Park Holidays in April 2022, we have focused on integration as well as being very selective in our approach to acquisitions. The U.K. market for holiday parks remains highly fragmented. And as we have done in the U.S. over the years, we have used our Park Holidays' footprint to opportunistically scale our presence in the U.K. Subsequent to the Park Holidays transaction, we acquired 14 best-in-class holiday parks in the U.K. These investments have accretive going-in cap rates, and we believe they will deliver significant ongoing growth and yield strong returns. In light of current market conditions, we have shown discipline with regard to our approach to capital allocation, and we'll continue to do so going forward. As we sharpen our pencil and assess capital and funding alternatives, growing our revenue-producing sites through expansions and ground-up developments continues to offer accretive returns. During 2022, we delivered 2,000 new expansion and greenfield development sites in North America, which was at the high end of our guidance. These new sites will begin contributing revenue in 2023 and provide a new base for growth in the coming years. We have inventory of over 16,000 fully-entitled sites for development and delivery in future years, representing embedded continued growth. Additionally, we regularly evaluate our portfolio for capital recycling opportunities to enhance our long-term growth profile. With respect to ESG, we continually identify ways that we can enhance our corporate citizenship. Sun recently set a target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2045. And as previously announced, we added Jeff Blau, CEO of Related Companies, to our Board of Directors. Jeff's experience and leadership will be a tremendous addition to our team. Lastly, our Board has raised our 2023 distribution to $3.72 per share, a 5.7% increase from the prior year. We're very pleased with our 2022 achievements. I'd like to thank all of our Sun team members who contributed extraordinary efforts to our collective success. As we look ahead to 2023, we once again expect to deliver a year of solid Same Property growth. As our 30-year track record has demonstrated, we have a business model that delivers results throughout economic cycles, supported by compelling supply-demand fundamentals. We will remain disciplined in our investment activity, and our unparalleled expansion and development platform will continue to provide us with a differentiated growth opportunity. I will now turn the call over to John and Fernando to speak to our results and guidance in detail. John?\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. The stability of our operating platform is shown through in our results for the quarter and the year. MH and RV Same Property NOI increased by 4.4% in the quarter. 4.9% growth in revenues reflected a 5% increase in weighted average monthly rent and a 180-basis point occupancy gain. 5.8% increase in expenses was primarily related to turnover costs in our rental program, as one consequence of the pandemic was lengthened average stay and therefore, higher related refurbishment costs. Having turned over these units, we are now able to realize higher rents on incoming leases. For the full year, Same Property MH and RV NOI grew 5.4%, driven by a 5.7% increase in revenue and a 6.2% increase in expenses. The strength of our portfolio is a direct result of our irreplaceable locations, the hard work of our team members and our continued reinvestment in our communities. At our RV communities, we set another annual record for site conversions to annual leases. Full year transient Same Property RV revenues grew by 3.1%, reflecting an average rate of growth of 14.1%, despite an almost 10% reduction in available site nights from the strategic conversion of transient sites to annual leases. Occupancy in our Same Property MH and RV portfolio remained strong, increasing 180 basis points during 2022 to end the year at 98.6%. Park Holidays' portfolio is performing above our original underwriting, and the management team has done an excellent job integrating into Sun. The fourth quarter continued to show strength. For the 31 properties Park Holidays has owned since at least January 2021, home sales rose 17%. Full year weighted average rental rates increased 5.4%, driving a 24% increase in home revenues. Marina has exceeded our expectations with a 10.4% increase in same marina NOI during the quarter and a 7.7% increase for the full year. The outperformance is due to higher demand for wet slips and dry storage spaces. Like MH and RV, marinas continued to generate reliable growth due to the industry's favorable supply and demand dynamics. In terms of external growth, during 2022 and through the date of this call, Sun acquired 70 operating properties for $2.2 billion and spent approximately $62 million for developable land parcels. The acquired land can support over 2,500 future MH and RV sites. Development is in Sun's DNA. For the full year 2022, Sun delivered approximately 1,160 expansion sites at 11 existing communities and over 840 sites at six development communities in the U.S. for a total of 2,000 future revenue-producing sites. Looking ahead, we have a solid development and expansion pipeline that can deliver accretive growth for years to come as well as the proven skill set and platform to sustain our growth. Going forward, we will focus on delivering two to three new MH developments each year as well as continued expansions at our existing properties. With regard to home sales, our average new home selling price in the U.S. was $196,000 for the quarter, reflecting the high demand at and strategic locations at our properties. Within our MH and RV portfolio, we gained over 2,900 revenue-producing sites for the year. Total portfolio occupancy of 96.8% includes newly delivered development and expansion sites. Included in our revenue-producing site gains were over 2,250 transient RV annual lease conversions this year, a new record for Sun. We received an approximate 50% uplift in revenue in the first full year after conversion. Value proposition of an RV vacation one to three hours from home opens Sun to new customers who discover or rediscover the joy of a long-term RV experience. With regard to the three properties most directly affected by Hurricane Ian, I would note that the cleanup is complete, and we have started the rebuilding process. We relocated as many people as possible to other properties, including our team members in the area. We have recently received our first permit to place new homes, and our new home sales program is largely set in anticipation of reopening sites in the second half of the year. Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the entire Sun team for the privilege to serve as our President for the past eight years and as Chief Operating Officer since 2008. We are an unparalleled team that has assembled a best-in-class portfolio and operating platform that has delivered impressive results over many years and continues to be positioned for future growth. As I assume my new responsibilities focusing on our MH development efforts, I look forward to supporting Bruce and the entire team. I will now turn it over to Fernando to discuss our financial results in more detail. Fernando?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, John. For the year, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share of $7.35, a 12.9% increase from 2021. For the fourth quarter, we reported core FFO per diluted share of $1.33, a 1.5% increase from the prior year. Similar to last quarter, this quarter's outperformance was driven by total marina real property NOI, interest income and U.K. tax favorability. As of December 31, Sun had $7.2 billion of debt outstanding that carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%, with a weighted average maturity of 7.4 years. On a run rate trailing 12-month basis, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.8 times. In terms of capital markets activity, during and subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $311 million add-on to an existing secured financing with a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The proceeds were used to repay amounts on our revolving credit facility. In January of this year, we issued $400 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes, which benefited from $250 million of treasury locks and used those proceeds to further reduce our line of credit balance. Since we achieved an investment-grade rating in 2021, we have now issued $2.2 billion of unsecured fixed-rate notes across four tranches. Pro forma for this activity, our floating-rate debt was reduced to 16% of total debt, which has now decreased from 26% as of December 31, 2020. Turning to guidance for 2023. As summarized in yesterday's press release, we are establishing full year guidance for core FFO per share in the range of $7.22 to $7.42. We are also establishing guidance for first quarter 2023 core FFO per share in the range of $1.15 to $1.20. Note that we expect first quarter results to reflect the seasonality of U.K. operations, as outlined in our supplemental, which we acquired in April 2022. In 2023, we expect total Same Property NOI across manufactured housing, RV and marinas to increase between 4.9% and 5.9%. At the midpoint of the ranges, summarized in our press release, this total Same Property NOI growth assumes 4.6% growth from manufactured housing, 5.8% growth from RV and a 7% increase from marinas. Regarding average rental rate increases, we reiterate the guidance ranges provided back in October. At the midpoint, these rental increases are 6.3% for manufactured housing, 7.8% for RV and 7.5% for marinas. On a total portfolio basis, we expect total revenues from real property to increase between 8.1% and 8.7% in 2023, and expenses to increase between 13.5% and 13.9%. Included in this expected expense growth is an approximately $18 million increase in property-related insurance costs. We expect total real property NOI to increase between 4.5% and 5.7% during 2023 due to strong resident, guest and member demand at our properties. Our U.K. operations are included in our guidance for total NOI. We are also providing certain guidance data points to help the investment community track Park Holidays' performance. Our guidance assumes we increase revenue-producing sites by 2,800 to 3,100 sites in 2023. And we expect about 60% of these revenue-producing sites to come from RV transient site conversions to annual leases. We anticipate investing roughly $200 million in our ground-up development and expansion activity. Throughout 2022, we continue to focus on corporate expense rationalization, including process efficiencies and reducing our office footprint. Despite the high inflation environment, for 2023, we expect G&A expense to run between $256 million and $262 million, which equates to minimal growth over 2022 at the midpoint. Importantly, we expect our G&A as a percentage of revenue to decline this year. The final note, increasing interest rates were a headwind on FFO growth in the back half of 2022 and continue to be a headwind in our 2023 guidance. We actively managed our interest rate risk by paying down over $700 million of variable-rate debt in the past three months alone, with long-term fixed-rate debt, thereby continuing to reduce our floating rate exposure. We believe our guidance reflects the current interest rate outlook at the time of this call and is informed by forward interest rate curves as of the time of providing our guidance. Our platform of recession-resistant, best-in-class properties is positioned to continue generating strong cash flow growth for the benefit of our stakeholders. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions, dispositions and capital markets activity through February 22, 2023, and the effect of a property disposition under contract expected to close in March 2023. It does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on the insurance. You called out $18 million increase in property-related insurance. When was your -- when did your insurance renewal take place? How much is the insurance as a percentage of operating percentage? And just to try to frame it out, like if insurance is 15% to 20% of expenses and it was 20% higher than anticipated, that would be a 300 basis point to 400 basis point headwind. So, ex that drag, is the expense growth 6% to 7% and matching kind of like the top-line growth? Thanks.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hi, Michael. Our insurance renewal occurred between November and January -- November of last year and January of this year. Legal taxes and insurance of our Same Property portfolio represent -- are expected to represent about 10% this year. That is an increase of about 300 basis points over 2022. So, your math as far as the headwind from an expense growth perspective tracks.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And then -- thank you for that. And then, my second question is just on the flow-through of the NOI growth. Your NOI is expected to grow 4.5% to 5.7%. Your Same Property NOI is growing 4.9% to 5.9%, yet your guidance is calling for earnings to be down in 2023. So, can you walk through some of the pressure or other factors that are below the line that's not when you see the Same Property NOI growth flow through to the FFO?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. The primary factor, as mentioned on the call, is going to be our interest expense for -- projected interest expense for 2023. We are actively and programmatically working on a number of strategies to continue to reduce our exposure to variable-rate debt. But certainly, as we look out at expectations from a market perspective, there's potential for 2023 to set baseline as far as interest expense and then that either becomes neutral or a tailwind heading into future years.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck this year.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Micahel.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJosh Dennerlein: Hey, guys. I feel like throughout the fall, the messaging on the rate growth you were sending out was going to line up with expense growth. Correct me if I'm wrong, on -- that's kind of the message I got...\nFernando Castro-Caratini: In our conversations over the course of the fall, certainly, expectations for the rest of our expense line items do fall in line with that at the time and mentioned during our NAREIT meetings with investors, we had yet to fully set our insurance program for the year. So that was the remaining item from that perspective, and we did realize a larger-than-expected increase for 2023.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. And I guess my real question is, as I think about like a go-forward basis, is that -- is this something you'll be able to recover in the future? Like, obviously, like insurance jumped up a lot this year outside of your control a little bit. Like is there a way to kind of recover it kind of over the long term? Is that how you guys are thinking about it? Or has something kind of shifted in the model a bit?\nGary Shiffman: Hey, Josh, it's Gary. We feel it's definitely recoverable. One of the key factors of our business that we are able to pass on, expenses in the form of rental increases. And as we've talked about before, our business is really about reliable growth because of the strong demand and short supply. So, our expectation is that we can't pass-through the expenses. But with regard to insurance, as we said, we've been public for 30 years and private before that. I would suggest that we're really seeing, maybe a little bit earlier than others from a renewal standpoint, what everybody else has been or will be seeing going forward. It reflects the environment for insurance at this point in time. As we know, that can go up and down. So, our expectation is that we will pass-through these costs through rental increases as we go forward because they're part of our operating business. But that being said, we can't underscore the fact that with this increased cost, as Fernando mentioned of $18 million, we're still seeing at Same Property growth of 5.4% at the midpoint. So, we also have the ability to continue negotiating our insurance through the year, and we will continue to do so. But in the effort of being totally transparent of where our costs have gone to, that's what is included in our guidance.\nJosh Dennerlein: Appreciate the color, Gary. One last one from me. I know the marinas [under the] (ph) safe harbor. You guys are -- there's a membership program where now you can get your annual [indiscernible] at cost. Is that the main reason the service retail dining and entertainment NOI is declining year-over-year? And then, how are you guys thinking about the kind of payback as you kind of increase rate on the annual side? Like is it a two-year kind of payback, three-year? How are you guys thinking about that?\nGary Shiffman: I don't have the numbers right in front of me, and we can get back to you or perhaps Fernando does, but you're absolutely correct. As everyone might recall, strategically, we are always looking to convert lower-margin business over to the stickier side of rent. And while these aren't loss leaders, we are passing off gas, fuel at our cost to attract members. And I think it's reflected by the fact that we now have a waiting list in 80% of our marinas. I think it's growing from there right now, that we've noticed rental increases. What were they on the marina side, Fernando?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: At the midpoint, we were expecting 7.5% for this year. The waitlist, we're now -- we now have a waitlist at 91% of our marinas. And then, Josh, yes, the bulk of the SRD&E NOI year-over-year is coming from that active program on the fuel side. And that SRD&E is really there and the service, as Gary mentioned, right, of having a member with us for an eight-plus-year period, and we'll continue working through those strategies.\nGary Shiffman: So, strategically, over time, we expect to more than capture that difference, certainly, on a multiple basis for the stickiness of the rental revenue versus the lower-margin business. That being said, we firmly feel that these SRD&E activities, especially the service, is very, very important to the occupancy and to the stickiness and demand for the safe harbor marinas as compared to marinas that don't offer the service.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes, thanks, good morning. I guess maybe for Gary, just on the home sales in general, whether it's U.S., U.K., are you seeing anything by region, by product type, by price point? Just curious how kind of the, I guess, economic uncertainties are kind of weighing on sales and whether you're seeing any bumps in the road as you kind of look into '23.\nGary Shiffman: Steve, I can share with you, as of this point, and I'll let John go more into specific sales. New home sales are up. Average price was about...\nJohn McLaren: $196,000.\nGary Shiffman: $196,000. I think it's one of the high points that we've seen. I think it totally reflects quality, location and value of the assets in our portfolio. I think it clearly reflects a capital reinvestment that we've shared with our stakeholders before, that if we don't reinvest in our communities, we do strip the equity right out from underneath the homeowners. So, we have a stringent policy there. On the used -- pre-owned home side of things, ironically, we've seen demand that's so strong that we've been able to buy less inventory over a period of the last 12 months or so. So, our new home or pre-owned home sales being down a little bit, it's just reflective of the demand, people staying in their homes longer. And the fact that they're direct selling their homes, so there's no interruption in rent to us, but we're not able to buy the inventory to flip into the used homes as we have been. It tracks over a 30-year period of time that will go up and down a little bit, so we don't see that as anything negative whatsoever. On the U.K. side, we're seeing enormous strength on the higher end of home buying, the more expensive homes increasing. And I turn to John, who's overseeing that, to talk a little bit more about the particulars of the U.K. home sales.\nJohn McLaren: Yes. I mean with respect to U.K. home sales, I mean, our team over there sold over 2,900 houses in 2022, which is a 23% increase year-over-year. So, like Gary said, the demand continues to be very strong, so much so that we -- I think we shared before that we've built out almost 700 expansion sites over the course finishing in 2022, that all sold up in 2022, and look to expand another 500 going into the season this year, which will be filled up by the end of 2023. So really, really strong demand. And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that there's higher costs for basic items, which has caused more people to holiday domestically in the U.K. rather than go to Europe. We're fortunate that the higher income earners in the U.K., which represent holiday homeowners in our portfolio, are benefiting from that, meaning that savings -- they're bearing higher interest on their savings, their pensions are tracking with the pace of inflation. And as we shared with the original information we provided on the deal, Brexit still makes it difficult to travel in the continent. It's gotten more expensive. The pound is still devalued in comparison to this time last year, and it's -- most people travel within two hours to get to the properties. And so -- and then the other thing that I would add is looking out into 2023 from a strength perspective, 90% of our owners have already paid their 2023 pitch fees in full are committed on direct debit. So, things are rock-solid.\nGary Shiffman: That 90% is ahead of the same time last year and the previous years.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks for that answer. I guess just one for Fernando on the balance sheet. Obviously, floating-rate debts caught a lot of people maybe not by surprise, but certainly been more powerful and had a bigger negative impact. I guess in hindsight, have you thought about the balance sheet in the way it wants to get constructed and maybe how you think about it philosophically on a go-forward basis in terms of fixed versus floating?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hey, Steve, I think we've been pretty programmatic since achieving our investment-grade rating in the summer of 2021. We've done over $2.2 billion of IG unsecured bonds with that public market. We've also taken advantage of the fact that our assets that are still under secured financing or still have mortgages, because of their strong performance, we're able to borrow up on existing financings and did a $311 million one that closed between December and January over the course of the last couple of months. Today, we stand at about 16% floating-rate debt. As we look at our -- as we look strategically at the portfolio, and Gary mentioned in his remarks, right, we can -- we look at our investment program and ground-up development and expansion, we will be able to practically self-fund our investment activity in 2023, are selectively looking at opportunities on the capital recycling front, there's a couple of assets here and there, that over time can also reduce variable-rate debt. And I would remind the market, we have very manageable maturities, no looming towers over the course of the next couple of years. We have about $117 million, $118 million coming due in the second half of the year and are being programmatic about locking in that cost today, as we've done over the course of the last couple of years. But certainly, looking to actively manage our exposure to floating-rate debt.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. That's it from me.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I wanted to follow on Steve's question. And he alluded to it, the rising rates is not necessarily a surprise, especially in the last few months. So, I'm guessing, can you just walk us through why you allowed floating-rate debt to increase during the fourth quarter and refinance it post quarter?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: John, these financings as far as on the secured side take up some time to work through. It's actually one that we started on in July of the second quarter. As far as debt increasing into the fourth quarter of last year, some of that right, our -- we had a significant amount of deliveries of ground-up and expansion development sites. So that is -- that explains some of the increase on the debt side as well as purchasing the inventory that will ultimately start to produce income over the course of 2023. Those would be the primary reasons from that perspective. And then, about 20%, 25% of it is, right, we -- is the FX on the debt amount. So, from the end of September to the end of December, the pound did appreciate significantly. So that would -- that accounts for about an additional $90 million of that quarter-to-quarter increase.\nJohn Kim: And then to further reduce the floating rate exposure, are you looking to use interest rate swaps or utilize fixed-rate debt?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: We've been quite programmatic from that perspective to support our issuance in the unsecured bond market. We did over since December of 2021 about 850 of treasury locks and swaps. We also did swap 400 million of our pound sterling term loan in the U.K. So yes, that does factor into our toolbox.\nJohn Kim: Okay. A follow-up question on insurance. How much is your increase in insurance due to your exposure to Florida? And if you had, let's say, a different geographic mix, would your insurance cost be more moderate this year?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. It's a great question. And the scale and size, John, I think we're able to get best-in-class pricing, so to speak, and it is a question that we certainly asked. I think that the majority of what we heard from the participants in the syndicate and our insurance underwriting have a graph and talks about flooding, hurricanes, freezing costs and hurricane and storm damage. And they look at the claims that they've paid out versus the premiums they've taken in. And I think this is where when I referred to the fact we're seeing the reality of what's out there overall. We're not going to reflect that different than our competitors and other asset classes. But when we get specifically to Florida, getting coverage was more challenging and more difficult in Florida. We don't have it broken down individually to Florida. We negotiate as a package. So, I would just point to the overall increase in insurance. The fact that we're in Florida, Texas and California is by design. There's over 100 million people there, and we focus our geographic footprint and target the right markets to operate in. And the demand for affordable housing has never been stronger in those markets, so it speaks to the high occupancies, the ability to push through inflationary rental increases. And we will closely evaluate and continue to evaluate our exposure that is impacted by insurance as we go forward.\nJohn McLaren: And I would just emphasize the point that Gary made in his answer, which is that this has a lot more to do with what events are taking place across the world, okay? This is less of a Sun issue, an asset class issue or anything like that. I mean you look at everything, whether it's earthquakes in Turkey and so forth that's impacting the cost of insurance for everybody. And really, that's -- I think that sort of everybody is, for lack of better words, the beneficiary of those events happening in the form of higher costs.\nJohn Kim: I'm just wondering if that changes your view at all on where you allocate capital going forward, whether it's U.K., Midwest or some other markets where it may alleviate some of these factors.\nGary Shiffman: I think that absolutely does have bearing on how we think about things and how we look at things. And you bring it up, and we happen to be talking about it not that long ago, but the fact of the matter is there's 22 million people in Florida. 320,000, I think, we talked about moved in there last year. So strategically, we do have to think about the cost return proposition in that state as we do everywhere. And I would suggest that strategically, we're looking at it very carefully.\nJohn Kim: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nKeegan Carl: Hey, guys. Maybe first on same store revenue expectations for '23. They definitely came in looking pretty strong, so just a few questions. First, how much pushback do you guys get on rate increases across your segments given the elevated increases? And second, specifically on marinas, how much longer do you think you can push at an elevated level? I think the past channel checks we've done, there's concern for a while that outsized pricing power is eventually going to deteriorate because it's going to break boat owners. So curious for your thoughts there.\nGary Shiffman: I'll address the marine part, and you can talk about the rest of the portfolio, John. But I think when we talk about supply/demand, we talk about over 11 million vessels registered for 800,000, 900,000 wet and dry slips. And as we spoke earlier, we're intentionally shifting a value proposition that will support continued rental increases by offering memberships, the other lower-margin attributes such as fuel, such as discounted transient stays when there's open sites or slips available and other membership opportunities. So, with that kind of a supply/demand out of balance, we're very comfortable and expecting to continue growth similar to what we've been experiencing. So, we don't currently see those type of headwinds that you're suggesting in the marina business. And I'll let John talk really about a 40-year history of manufactured housing.\nJohn McLaren: Yes. I mean it's -- Keegan, it's really it's a balanced conversation, which is to say, obviously, looking at what expense growth is and applying to passing that on to our residents, but we view rent increases like a marathon versus a sprint. As we've shared before, I think folks have heard me say it 100 times is that the most expensive site we have in our portfolio is a vacant one. And I think our strategy has really stood the test of time. For 25-plus years, we've delivered positive revenue and NOI growth every year when others have seen ups and downs. We continue to deliver long-term cash flow stability. We maintain a solid relationship with our resident base, which is also our sales force. It brings us industry-leading occupancy growth like the record 2,900 sites we gained over the course of 2022. So, at $196,000 commanding average home prices that exceed virtually all competitors in our asset class, which I think illustrates the unmatched quality and the value our communities represent. So really, in summary, our strategy is well balanced, we believe, across all stakeholders, including our residents that live in well-maintained communities and create value in their homes. And so, it's something that we watch and talk about very closely as we think about what increases and how we can push further on both MH and RV.\nGary Shiffman: And the only thing I'd add and then we covered in our posted deck is the delta difference between alternatives, whether it being single-family residential, whether it be multifamily, where you still do provide 25% more space at 50% of the per square foot cost offer a lot of advantages of being able to pull right up to the house, bring your groceries on, have your car in a carport, a garage, et cetera. And then, while we certainly know there are headwinds on site build housing, especially due to mortgage rates, the delta difference between a single-family residence and the overall cost of living in one of our manufactured housing communities is such that for many, many Americans, manufactured housing will be the only option available for home ownership. So, I think, again, 40-year track record, 30-year public, 10-year private, indicates that we will be able to continue to get the correct growth based on the value proposition. Same is true in the RV for vacationing. And certainly, in the U.K. as the second vacation home, an alternative to more expensive vacationing in the U.K.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And then, taking a step back, so if we think about your -- both your real property, excluding transient and transient on a like-for-like basis, if we exclude your transient conversion expectations for '23, where would the numbers shake out, both on excluding transient, then transient as a whole, right? Because you obviously expect to compare a lot of sites, which means the comparative pool for transient is going to be much lower.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Keegan, I'll give you the comparative for Same Property. We were expecting about a 90-basis point increase year-over-year in revenue from transient RV. That is on a base of approximately 7.5% to 8% fewer site nights. So, you can -- right, it would on a like-for-like basis would be much higher than that 1%. But as John mentioned or maybe I mentioned during -- in my section of the script, we are expecting another very strong year of conversions from transient sites to annual leases. Of the 3,100 at the high end, 60% is expected on the RV side. And this is right, once you've converted that site, you have a resident there for on average a five-or-plus year period of time. That is very likely making improvements to that site and bringing up the value of the community itself or being hyper-focused on continuing the conversion program over to the annual side.\nKeegan Carl: And just on the excluding transient portion too, right, what would the range be if you exclude your expectations, because there's going to be a bit of an uplift?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: I don't have that broken out here in front of me. We can follow up, that's a very quick follow-up with you after the call.\nKeegan Carl: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: Hi, everyone. I just have a question on the service retail and dining guide. I just want to make sure I'm looking at it correctly. It does look like it's going down a little bit year-over-year. And more so a question on how we should think about modeling this line item going forward. I think you mentioned and maybe in the prepared comments that it was almost like a loss leader. So, should this only grow with acquisitions? And then second part, I did see a termination income. Is there anything impacting the guide this year from the termination of a lease?\nGary Shiffman: Yes, Wes, it's Gary. I don't want anyone to think of it as a loss leader, because it's not a loss leader. We've just elected to shift smaller margin over to higher valuation in the form of sticky rent. So, we're not losing money or subsidizing anything. And when we talk about passing on guests at our cost, it's not just the cost we buy it at the pumper truck, but it's the cost associated with delivering it. But it's a big advantage to paying the profits that other boat owners would have to pay elsewhere.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: And on the lease termination, we did mention in my remarks, we did rationalize some space in our main office and got out of two floors in our offices here in Southfield.\nWes Golladay: Okay. Got it. And then, you did mention potentially asset recycling. Do you have a preference from proceeds, whether it's to pay down variable-rate debt or to recycle or to buy assets? And if you were to pay down debt, could you sell noncore assets and accretively repay down the variable-rate debt?\nGary Shiffman: I think everything is under review. We continue to evaluate parts of our portfolio where we think we can redeploy the capital with greater growth. Certainly with the headwinds of interest rates today, that is one big focus, Wes. So, we're not running to shed assets, but we are reviewing them very, very carefully as to growth. And as we've shared, again, that today, one of the areas that I think differentiates Sun and gives us the greatest opportunity is the ability to create new ground-up developments and expand our manufactured housing portfolio. So, because there is a cost associated with over 16,000 sites that we've already bought and paid for, that are not yielding any return, we carry on debt. And by paying down that debt, if that's what we elect to do, we obviously recapture of that lost interest rate. So that is one area. The second area is certainly funding the development costs so that we can generate the high returns and create value for the stakeholders by increasing our manufactured housing portfolio. And third, of course, is that difficult economies often turn up opportunities, and we are looking at a number of opportunities from all of the different platforms. There is nothing identified yet or nothing that is meaningful. But I believe in these periods of times, as I said before, as people have to refinance things at a whole new rate in a whole new world, opportunities may become available there that are accretive across our current cost of capital. So, paying down variable debt is probably something that allows us greater opportunity to create growth in the future or if there's something very accretive, we would look at that as well. So, there's no specific plan. I think just general good stewardship of how we think about reducing that variable debt.\nWes Golladay: I appreciate. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Robyn Luu with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nRobyn Luu: Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the previous question on home sale trends in the U.S. and U.K. So, home sale prices fell by 15% from last quarter in the U.K., but was flat in U.S. MH business. So, I understand the fourth quarter is typically a seasonally slow period in the U.K., but can you maybe talk to the weakness in the U.K. prices? Is -- does the 15% reflect market prices? Or are you perhaps pushing discounts to get the volume?\nJohn McLaren: No. I mean it's not really discounts to push the volume, but I think when we walked in, I think part of the investment thesis that we shared in the beginning was the fact that we might thin the margin a little bit to gain more sites and gain more ongoing revenue, okay, on those sites. And so basically, we're just executing the plan that we set out to do.\nGary Shiffman: Yes. We prefer the stickiness of the rent over the one-time margin on the home sales. So, you will continue to see an emphasis on that strategy as we go forward.\nRobyn Luu: So, that doesn't reflect market prices to 15%?\nGary Shiffman: Sorry, Robyn, what was the question?\nRobyn Luu: So, the 15%, just to clarify, the 15% does not reflect market prices for U.K. home sales?\nGary Shiffman: No. I think it reflects our strategic plan with management. But it is interesting, as John pointed out, we've seen some higher growth on the higher end of what they referred to as the lodges. And that's an area that we're focusing on, and there are also smaller margins on the lodges than there are on the lower-based homes.\nRobyn Luu: Yes. Thanks. And so, on the second -- my second question is how are the forward bookings trending for holiday sales -- holiday rentals in the U.K.?\nJohn McLaren: They're actually trending a little bit ahead of this past year, which of course, as we shared before, is great because that is the feeder for more holiday home sales and more rent paying sites.\nGary Shiffman: So, in the Park Holidays portfolio, correct [if I'm getting] (ph) this wrong, 40% of all homebuyers have stayed in one of the rentals in the property and 60% of all buyers have stayed in a rental, in a park, in a holiday property. So, it really is the feeder, if you will. So, seeing the demand, where it is now, is very encouraging for us. I will add that we did speak to them the other day. There is a fair amount of competition out there and some discounting that's taking place outside of the Park Holidays and the more inferior properties, but I think it's driving people to expect quality at Park Holidays. And with the addition of Park Leisure, which are really the high end of holiday vacation parks, they have a much lower percent of fleet home ownership in those 14 properties.\nJohn McLaren: Almost none.\nGary Shiffman: Almost none, yes.\nRobyn Luu: Thank you.\nGary Shiffman: Yes, we are seeing positive strength there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Heffern: Yes. Good morning, everyone. What are you seeing on the leading-edge demand for transient RV? I know it's obviously the low demand time of year, but any color on what happened year-to-date in the forward bookings would be great.\nJohn McLaren: Sure. I think from the booking pace perspective, right now, we are trending just a little bit ahead of last year, which is great. We are nearly 95% booked, which is better than we were at this time last year for Q1. So, we're running a little bit ahead. But if you look out into the whole year, we're a little bit ahead in total booking pace, meaning bookings that have actually happened at this point in time versus where we were last year.\nGary Shiffman: I think I'd remind everybody, we're going back to more of a pre-COVID normal pattern. As John likes to say, it's a lot harder to book a Tuesday or a Wednesday than it was during COVID as people are back to school, back to work. And so, our expectation is a more normalized year-over-year transient growth. People are still positive about experiencing that outdoor vacation. There is an increase in the surveys that we've done and our competitor has done, with expectation of RV stay and camping this coming year. So, it's more back to normal, I think. And a big focus that has really been there for almost 10 years now of the conversions that we talk a lot about, it is easier to forecast when we convert a transient to an annual. It is more cost effective in picking up that 50% increase on a per site basis for the first year, and about 7.5% conversions last year of our transient to annual. And going forward, we expect good solid growth this coming year. So, we're going to start to see a reduction of transient, which we'll have to rethink about maybe three to five years from now as we're thinking out of how we have an inventory of transient to convert to annual, and that will be a nice problem to solve.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, on the U.K., it looked like MH occupancy was down almost 300 basis points in the fourth quarter. Is that a demand impact? Is that seasonal? Or is there some other explanation?\nJohn McLaren: That's a result of adding sites to the portfolio through expansion.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good afternoon. Just one quick one from me on acquisitions. Could you maybe go into the three deals you did in December, MH, RV, marina in terms of cap rate sourcing? And would you expect your volume of acquisitions in 2023 to be lower or higher than 2022?\nGary Shiffman: Trying to grab the paperwork here. I think that we don't typically provide guidance towards acquisitions and, of course, capital marketplace activities. We've discussed the fact that cost of capital is such that we have sharpened our pencil razor thin. I don't believe we'll lose any opportunities because Sun always has a seat at the table and just about all of the sellers will reach out to Sun, either directly or through a relationship or brokerage. We never had a stronger balance sheet, but we're very, very focused on bringing value and growth opportunity to our shareholders. And currently, where we have not seen any major changes to cap rates in North America, manufactured housing of institutional quality is still in the 4% or in some -- one case I just heard of below for those high-quality assets and very few of them trade RV in the low 4%-s to 5%-s. Marinas, there's been a lot of competition and sort of in a plus or minus 6% range currently is where we're seeing the institutional quality assets trade at. So, it's going to take a real opportunity. It has accretiveness and embedded growth where we can justify deploying capital in this environment and deliver the kind of growth our stakeholders are used to. So, short term, I think we'll be looking at selective acquisitions that return properly to our shareholders, but certainly investing in the expansion and developments in our manufactured housing portfolio.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Maybe a follow-up on that in terms of the development sites. How construction costs changed on those? And how is kind of the ROI profile of your development sites evolved the past 12 months?\nGary Shiffman: Yes, that's a great question. We certainly saw the cost of development spike up through the pandemic, short supply, supply chain, et cetera. We have begun to see it decline. We're looking to build our new developments to a high single-digit unlevered IRR upon stabilization. Currently, we've adjusted our returns to low double digit, in part because of the large rental increases as a reflection of CPI and inflation. So, as we model out going forward, our going-in rents are higher than we originally modeled them out. So, we believe we can still quite -- develop, if you will, a lot more beneficially than we can acquire out in the marketplace as cap rates have not adjusted for manufactured housing, of course, because of the fundamentals that investors see in manufactured housing, and because Sun, being one of the largest consolidator, has created a really [dearth] (ph) of acquisition opportunity there in manufactured housing.\nAnthony Powell: Thank you for the color.\nGary Shiffman: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. As there are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Gary Shiffman for closing comments.\nGary Shiffman: We always appreciate the opportunity to have these calls and speak about the business. Today marks a very special day, and really want to take this opportunity to thank John for his unbelievable stewardship, both as President and Chief Operating Officer since 2008, if I got that correct. And really look forward to John's 10-year operating our communities, in particular, manufactured housing and being able to transfer that over to the 16,000-site inventory we now have to grow by. And in his stewardship and direction over there, we believe we will derive great benefit for our shareholders as we go forward in an area that really differentiates us from all others in our asset class. So, on behalf of the entire company, from the communities on up to senior management and executive team, I do want to extend our appreciation to John. Job well done.\nJohn McLaren: Thank you.\nGary Shiffman: We look forward to our next call and certainly invite anyone to reach out to Fernando and his team with any follow-up questions. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the company's remarks. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss fourth quarter and full year results for 2022 and our guidance for 2023. This year marks Sun's 30th year as a public company. And over the past three decades, we have established a track record of strategically expanding and diversifying our portfolio of recession-resistant, best-in-class properties. We and our stakeholders have benefited from the compelling supply and demand dynamics that underpin manufactured housing, RV communities and marinas. Our strategic approach has delivered an attractive balance of a reliable organic growth and strong FFO per share increases. We have increased rents throughout economic cycles, and our strong results for 2022 and outlook for Same Property NOI growth in 2023 demonstrates the benefits of operating in segments where supply is perpetually constrained and demand is resilient. In 2022, core FFO per share grew 12.9%, driven by strong demand for our offerings as well as our accretive investment activity. Demand for our manufactured housing communities and RV locations is evident in our consistently high occupancy levels, gains in revenue-producing sites and solid Same Property NOI growth. At year-end, our combined MH and RV occupancy was nearly 97%, reflecting approximately 96% occupancy within our manufactured housing portfolio. During the year, we achieved a record of over 2,900 revenue-producing site gains, driven by more than 2,250 conversions of transient RV sites to annual leases, which topped last year's record conversions of nearly 1,700 sites and represented a 36% year-over-year increase. In marinas, our 2022 Same Property results continue to demonstrate supply-demand tailwinds, with a 12:1 ratio of registered boats in the U.S. to the existing supply of leasable wet slips and dry storage spaces. This creates a very sticky customer base and gives us the ability to grow rents. The resilience of our platform can be seen in our full year total manufactured housing, RV and marina Same Property NOI results, which grew by 5.8% over 2021. With regard to external growth, since acquiring Park Holidays in April 2022, we have focused on integration as well as being very selective in our approach to acquisitions. The U.K. market for holiday parks remains highly fragmented. And as we have done in the U.S. over the years, we have used our Park Holidays' footprint to opportunistically scale our presence in the U.K. Subsequent to the Park Holidays transaction, we acquired 14 best-in-class holiday parks in the U.K. These investments have accretive going-in cap rates, and we believe they will deliver significant ongoing growth and yield strong returns. In light of current market conditions, we have shown discipline with regard to our approach to capital allocation, and we'll continue to do so going forward. As we sharpen our pencil and assess capital and funding alternatives, growing our revenue-producing sites through expansions and ground-up developments continues to offer accretive returns. During 2022, we delivered 2,000 new expansion and greenfield development sites in North America, which was at the high end of our guidance. These new sites will begin contributing revenue in 2023 and provide a new base for growth in the coming years. We have inventory of over 16,000 fully-entitled sites for development and delivery in future years, representing embedded continued growth. Additionally, we regularly evaluate our portfolio for capital recycling opportunities to enhance our long-term growth profile. With respect to ESG, we continually identify ways that we can enhance our corporate citizenship. Sun recently set a target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2045. And as previously announced, we added Jeff Blau, CEO of Related Companies, to our Board of Directors. Jeff's experience and leadership will be a tremendous addition to our team. Lastly, our Board has raised our 2023 distribution to $3.72 per share, a 5.7% increase from the prior year. We're very pleased with our 2022 achievements. I'd like to thank all of our Sun team members who contributed extraordinary efforts to our collective success. As we look ahead to 2023, we once again expect to deliver a year of solid Same Property growth. As our 30-year track record has demonstrated, we have a business model that delivers results throughout economic cycles, supported by compelling supply-demand fundamentals. We will remain disciplined in our investment activity, and our unparalleled expansion and development platform will continue to provide us with a differentiated growth opportunity. I will now turn the call over to John and Fernando to speak to our results and guidance in detail. John? Hey, Josh, it's Gary. We feel it's definitely recoverable. One of the key factors of our business that we are able to pass on, expenses in the form of rental increases. And as we've talked about before, our business is really about reliable growth because of the strong demand and short supply. So, our expectation is that we can't pass-through the expenses. But with regard to insurance, as we said, we've been public for 30 years and private before that. I would suggest that we're really seeing, maybe a little bit earlier than others from a renewal standpoint, what everybody else has been or will be seeing going forward. It reflects the environment for insurance at this point in time. As we know, that can go up and down. So, our expectation is that we will pass-through these costs through rental increases as we go forward because they're part of our operating business. But that being said, we can't underscore the fact that with this increased cost, as Fernando mentioned of $18 million, we're still seeing at Same Property growth of 5.4% at the midpoint. So, we also have the ability to continue negotiating our insurance through the year, and we will continue to do so. But in the effort of being totally transparent of where our costs have gone to, that's what is included in our guidance. I don't have the numbers right in front of me, and we can get back to you or perhaps Fernando does, but you're absolutely correct. As everyone might recall, strategically, we are always looking to convert lower-margin business over to the stickier side of rent. And while these aren't loss leaders, we are passing off gas, fuel at our cost to attract members. And I think it's reflected by the fact that we now have a waiting list in 80% of our marinas. I think it's growing from there right now, that we've noticed rental increases. What were they on the marina side, Fernando? So, strategically, over time, we expect to more than capture that difference, certainly, on a multiple basis for the stickiness of the rental revenue versus the lower-margin business. That being said, we firmly feel that these SRD&E activities, especially the service, is very, very important to the occupancy and to the stickiness and demand for the safe harbor marinas as compared to marinas that don't offer the service. Steve, I can share with you, as of this point, and I'll let John go more into specific sales. New home sales are up. Average price was about... $196,000. I think it's one of the high points that we've seen. I think it totally reflects quality, location and value of the assets in our portfolio. I think it clearly reflects a capital reinvestment that we've shared with our stakeholders before, that if we don't reinvest in our communities, we do strip the equity right out from underneath the homeowners. So, we have a stringent policy there. On the used -- pre-owned home side of things, ironically, we've seen demand that's so strong that we've been able to buy less inventory over a period of the last 12 months or so. So, our new home or pre-owned home sales being down a little bit, it's just reflective of the demand, people staying in their homes longer. And the fact that they're direct selling their homes, so there's no interruption in rent to us, but we're not able to buy the inventory to flip into the used homes as we have been. It tracks over a 30-year period of time that will go up and down a little bit, so we don't see that as anything negative whatsoever. On the U.K. side, we're seeing enormous strength on the higher end of home buying, the more expensive homes increasing. And I turn to John, who's overseeing that, to talk a little bit more about the particulars of the U.K. home sales. That 90% is ahead of the same time last year and the previous years. Yes. It's a great question. And the scale and size, John, I think we're able to get best-in-class pricing, so to speak, and it is a question that we certainly asked. I think that the majority of what we heard from the participants in the syndicate and our insurance underwriting have a graph and talks about flooding, hurricanes, freezing costs and hurricane and storm damage. And they look at the claims that they've paid out versus the premiums they've taken in. And I think this is where when I referred to the fact we're seeing the reality of what's out there overall. We're not going to reflect that different than our competitors and other asset classes. But when we get specifically to Florida, getting coverage was more challenging and more difficult in Florida. We don't have it broken down individually to Florida. We negotiate as a package. So, I would just point to the overall increase in insurance. The fact that we're in Florida, Texas and California is by design. There's over 100 million people there, and we focus our geographic footprint and target the right markets to operate in. And the demand for affordable housing has never been stronger in those markets, so it speaks to the high occupancies, the ability to push through inflationary rental increases. And we will closely evaluate and continue to evaluate our exposure that is impacted by insurance as we go forward. I think that absolutely does have bearing on how we think about things and how we look at things. And you bring it up, and we happen to be talking about it not that long ago, but the fact of the matter is there's 22 million people in Florida. 320,000, I think, we talked about moved in there last year. So strategically, we do have to think about the cost return proposition in that state as we do everywhere. And I would suggest that strategically, we're looking at it very carefully. I'll address the marine part, and you can talk about the rest of the portfolio, John. But I think when we talk about supply/demand, we talk about over 11 million vessels registered for 800,000, 900,000 wet and dry slips. And as we spoke earlier, we're intentionally shifting a value proposition that will support continued rental increases by offering memberships, the other lower-margin attributes such as fuel, such as discounted transient stays when there's open sites or slips available and other membership opportunities. So, with that kind of a supply/demand out of balance, we're very comfortable and expecting to continue growth similar to what we've been experiencing. So, we don't currently see those type of headwinds that you're suggesting in the marina business. And I'll let John talk really about a 40-year history of manufactured housing. And the only thing I'd add and then we covered in our posted deck is the delta difference between alternatives, whether it being single-family residential, whether it be multifamily, where you still do provide 25% more space at 50% of the per square foot cost offer a lot of advantages of being able to pull right up to the house, bring your groceries on, have your car in a carport, a garage, et cetera. And then, while we certainly know there are headwinds on site build housing, especially due to mortgage rates, the delta difference between a single-family residence and the overall cost of living in one of our manufactured housing communities is such that for many, many Americans, manufactured housing will be the only option available for home ownership. So, I think, again, 40-year track record, 30-year public, 10-year private, indicates that we will be able to continue to get the correct growth based on the value proposition. Same is true in the RV for vacationing. And certainly, in the U.K. as the second vacation home, an alternative to more expensive vacationing in the U.K. Yes, Wes, it's Gary. I don't want anyone to think of it as a loss leader, because it's not a loss leader. We've just elected to shift smaller margin over to higher valuation in the form of sticky rent. So, we're not losing money or subsidizing anything. And when we talk about passing on guests at our cost, it's not just the cost we buy it at the pumper truck, but it's the cost associated with delivering it. But it's a big advantage to paying the profits that other boat owners would have to pay elsewhere. I think everything is under review. We continue to evaluate parts of our portfolio where we think we can redeploy the capital with greater growth. Certainly with the headwinds of interest rates today, that is one big focus, Wes. So, we're not running to shed assets, but we are reviewing them very, very carefully as to growth. And as we've shared, again, that today, one of the areas that I think differentiates Sun and gives us the greatest opportunity is the ability to create new ground-up developments and expand our manufactured housing portfolio. So, because there is a cost associated with over 16,000 sites that we've already bought and paid for, that are not yielding any return, we carry on debt. And by paying down that debt, if that's what we elect to do, we obviously recapture of that lost interest rate. So that is one area. The second area is certainly funding the development costs so that we can generate the high returns and create value for the stakeholders by increasing our manufactured housing portfolio. And third, of course, is that difficult economies often turn up opportunities, and we are looking at a number of opportunities from all of the different platforms. There is nothing identified yet or nothing that is meaningful. But I believe in these periods of times, as I said before, as people have to refinance things at a whole new rate in a whole new world, opportunities may become available there that are accretive across our current cost of capital. So, paying down variable debt is probably something that allows us greater opportunity to create growth in the future or if there's something very accretive, we would look at that as well. So, there's no specific plan. I think just general good stewardship of how we think about reducing that variable debt. Yes. We prefer the stickiness of the rent over the one-time margin on the home sales. So, you will continue to see an emphasis on that strategy as we go forward. Sorry, Robyn, what was the question? No. I think it reflects our strategic plan with management. But it is interesting, as John pointed out, we've seen some higher growth on the higher end of what they referred to as the lodges. And that's an area that we're focusing on, and there are also smaller margins on the lodges than there are on the lower-based homes. So, in the Park Holidays portfolio, correct [if I'm getting] (ph) this wrong, 40% of all homebuyers have stayed in one of the rentals in the property and 60% of all buyers have stayed in a rental, in a park, in a holiday property. So, it really is the feeder, if you will. So, seeing the demand, where it is now, is very encouraging for us. I will add that we did speak to them the other day. There is a fair amount of competition out there and some discounting that's taking place outside of the Park Holidays and the more inferior properties, but I think it's driving people to expect quality at Park Holidays. And with the addition of Park Leisure, which are really the high end of holiday vacation parks, they have a much lower percent of fleet home ownership in those 14 properties. Almost none, yes. Yes, we are seeing positive strength there. I think I'd remind everybody, we're going back to more of a pre-COVID normal pattern. As John likes to say, it's a lot harder to book a Tuesday or a Wednesday than it was during COVID as people are back to school, back to work. And so, our expectation is a more normalized year-over-year transient growth. People are still positive about experiencing that outdoor vacation. There is an increase in the surveys that we've done and our competitor has done, with expectation of RV stay and camping this coming year. So, it's more back to normal, I think. And a big focus that has really been there for almost 10 years now of the conversions that we talk a lot about, it is easier to forecast when we convert a transient to an annual. It is more cost effective in picking up that 50% increase on a per site basis for the first year, and about 7.5% conversions last year of our transient to annual. And going forward, we expect good solid growth this coming year. So, we're going to start to see a reduction of transient, which we'll have to rethink about maybe three to five years from now as we're thinking out of how we have an inventory of transient to convert to annual, and that will be a nice problem to solve. Trying to grab the paperwork here. I think that we don't typically provide guidance towards acquisitions and, of course, capital marketplace activities. We've discussed the fact that cost of capital is such that we have sharpened our pencil razor thin. I don't believe we'll lose any opportunities because Sun always has a seat at the table and just about all of the sellers will reach out to Sun, either directly or through a relationship or brokerage. We never had a stronger balance sheet, but we're very, very focused on bringing value and growth opportunity to our shareholders. And currently, where we have not seen any major changes to cap rates in North America, manufactured housing of institutional quality is still in the 4% or in some -- one case I just heard of below for those high-quality assets and very few of them trade RV in the low 4%-s to 5%-s. Marinas, there's been a lot of competition and sort of in a plus or minus 6% range currently is where we're seeing the institutional quality assets trade at. So, it's going to take a real opportunity. It has accretiveness and embedded growth where we can justify deploying capital in this environment and deliver the kind of growth our stakeholders are used to. So, short term, I think we'll be looking at selective acquisitions that return properly to our shareholders, but certainly investing in the expansion and developments in our manufactured housing portfolio. Yes, that's a great question. We certainly saw the cost of development spike up through the pandemic, short supply, supply chain, et cetera. We have begun to see it decline. We're looking to build our new developments to a high single-digit unlevered IRR upon stabilization. Currently, we've adjusted our returns to low double digit, in part because of the large rental increases as a reflection of CPI and inflation. So, as we model out going forward, our going-in rents are higher than we originally modeled them out. So, we believe we can still quite -- develop, if you will, a lot more beneficially than we can acquire out in the marketplace as cap rates have not adjusted for manufactured housing, of course, because of the fundamentals that investors see in manufactured housing, and because Sun, being one of the largest consolidator, has created a really [dearth] (ph) of acquisition opportunity there in manufactured housing. Yes. We always appreciate the opportunity to have these calls and speak about the business. Today marks a very special day, and really want to take this opportunity to thank John for his unbelievable stewardship, both as President and Chief Operating Officer since 2008, if I got that correct. And really look forward to John's 10-year operating our communities, in particular, manufactured housing and being able to transfer that over to the 16,000-site inventory we now have to grow by. And in his stewardship and direction over there, we believe we will derive great benefit for our shareholders as we go forward in an area that really differentiates us from all others in our asset class. So, on behalf of the entire company, from the communities on up to senior management and executive team, I do want to extend our appreciation to John. Job well done. We look forward to our next call and certainly invite anyone to reach out to Fernando and his team with any follow-up questions. Thank you, everybody."

            "content": "Thank you, John. For the year, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share of $7.35, a 12.9% increase from 2021. For the fourth quarter, we reported core FFO per diluted share of $1.33, a 1.5% increase from the prior year. Similar to last quarter, this quarter's outperformance was driven by total marina real property NOI, interest income and U.K. tax favorability. As of December 31, Sun had $7.2 billion of debt outstanding that carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%, with a weighted average maturity of 7.4 years. On a run rate trailing 12-month basis, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.8 times. In terms of capital markets activity, during and subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $311 million add-on to an existing secured financing with a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The proceeds were used to repay amounts on our revolving credit facility. In January of this year, we issued $400 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes, which benefited from $250 million of treasury locks and used those proceeds to further reduce our line of credit balance. Since we achieved an investment-grade rating in 2021, we have now issued $2.2 billion of unsecured fixed-rate notes across four tranches. Pro forma for this activity, our floating-rate debt was reduced to 16% of total debt, which has now decreased from 26% as of December 31, 2020. Turning to guidance for 2023. As summarized in yesterday's press release, we are establishing full year guidance for core FFO per share in the range of $7.22 to $7.42. We are also establishing guidance for first quarter 2023 core FFO per share in the range of $1.15 to $1.20. Note that we expect first quarter results to reflect the seasonality of U.K. operations, as outlined in our supplemental, which we acquired in April 2022. In 2023, we expect total Same Property NOI across manufactured housing, RV and marinas to increase between 4.9% and 5.9%. At the midpoint of the ranges, summarized in our press release, this total Same Property NOI growth assumes 4.6% growth from manufactured housing, 5.8% growth from RV and a 7% increase from marinas. Regarding average rental rate increases, we reiterate the guidance ranges provided back in October. At the midpoint, these rental increases are 6.3% for manufactured housing, 7.8% for RV and 7.5% for marinas. On a total portfolio basis, we expect total revenues from real property to increase between 8.1% and 8.7% in 2023, and expenses to increase between 13.5% and 13.9%. Included in this expected expense growth is an approximately $18 million increase in property-related insurance costs. We expect total real property NOI to increase between 4.5% and 5.7% during 2023 due to strong resident, guest and member demand at our properties. Our U.K. operations are included in our guidance for total NOI. We are also providing certain guidance data points to help the investment community track Park Holidays' performance. Our guidance assumes we increase revenue-producing sites by 2,800 to 3,100 sites in 2023. And we expect about 60% of these revenue-producing sites to come from RV transient site conversions to annual leases. We anticipate investing roughly $200 million in our ground-up development and expansion activity. Throughout 2022, we continue to focus on corporate expense rationalization, including process efficiencies and reducing our office footprint. Despite the high inflation environment, for 2023, we expect G&A expense to run between $256 million and $262 million, which equates to minimal growth over 2022 at the midpoint. Importantly, we expect our G&A as a percentage of revenue to decline this year. The final note, increasing interest rates were a headwind on FFO growth in the back half of 2022 and continue to be a headwind in our 2023 guidance. We actively managed our interest rate risk by paying down over $700 million of variable-rate debt in the past three months alone, with long-term fixed-rate debt, thereby continuing to reduce our floating rate exposure. We believe our guidance reflects the current interest rate outlook at the time of this call and is informed by forward interest rate curves as of the time of providing our guidance. Our platform of recession-resistant, best-in-class properties is positioned to continue generating strong cash flow growth for the benefit of our stakeholders. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions, dispositions and capital markets activity through February 22, 2023, and the effect of a property disposition under contract expected to close in March 2023. It does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for questions. Operator? Hi, Michael. Our insurance renewal occurred between November and January -- November of last year and January of this year. Legal taxes and insurance of our Same Property portfolio represent -- are expected to represent about 10% this year. That is an increase of about 300 basis points over 2022. So, your math as far as the headwind from an expense growth perspective tracks. Sure. The primary factor, as mentioned on the call, is going to be our interest expense for -- projected interest expense for 2023. We are actively and programmatically working on a number of strategies to continue to reduce our exposure to variable-rate debt. But certainly, as we look out at expectations from a market perspective, there's potential for 2023 to set baseline as far as interest expense and then that either becomes neutral or a tailwind heading into future years. Thank you, Micahel. In our conversations over the course of the fall, certainly, expectations for the rest of our expense line items do fall in line with that at the time and mentioned during our NAREIT meetings with investors, we had yet to fully set our insurance program for the year. So that was the remaining item from that perspective, and we did realize a larger-than-expected increase for 2023. At the midpoint, we were expecting 7.5% for this year. The waitlist, we're now -- we now have a waitlist at 91% of our marinas. And then, Josh, yes, the bulk of the SRD&E NOI year-over-year is coming from that active program on the fuel side. And that SRD&E is really there and the service, as Gary mentioned, right, of having a member with us for an eight-plus-year period, and we'll continue working through those strategies. Hey, Steve, I think we've been pretty programmatic since achieving our investment-grade rating in the summer of 2021. We've done over $2.2 billion of IG unsecured bonds with that public market. We've also taken advantage of the fact that our assets that are still under secured financing or still have mortgages, because of their strong performance, we're able to borrow up on existing financings and did a $311 million one that closed between December and January over the course of the last couple of months. Today, we stand at about 16% floating-rate debt. As we look at our -- as we look strategically at the portfolio, and Gary mentioned in his remarks, right, we can -- we look at our investment program and ground-up development and expansion, we will be able to practically self-fund our investment activity in 2023, are selectively looking at opportunities on the capital recycling front, there's a couple of assets here and there, that over time can also reduce variable-rate debt. And I would remind the market, we have very manageable maturities, no looming towers over the course of the next couple of years. We have about $117 million, $118 million coming due in the second half of the year and are being programmatic about locking in that cost today, as we've done over the course of the last couple of years. But certainly, looking to actively manage our exposure to floating-rate debt. Thank you, Steve. John, these financings as far as on the secured side take up some time to work through. It's actually one that we started on in July of the second quarter. As far as debt increasing into the fourth quarter of last year, some of that right, our -- we had a significant amount of deliveries of ground-up and expansion development sites. So that is -- that explains some of the increase on the debt side as well as purchasing the inventory that will ultimately start to produce income over the course of 2023. Those would be the primary reasons from that perspective. And then, about 20%, 25% of it is, right, we -- is the FX on the debt amount. So, from the end of September to the end of December, the pound did appreciate significantly. So that would -- that accounts for about an additional $90 million of that quarter-to-quarter increase. We've been quite programmatic from that perspective to support our issuance in the unsecured bond market. We did over since December of 2021 about 850 of treasury locks and swaps. We also did swap 400 million of our pound sterling term loan in the U.K. So yes, that does factor into our toolbox. Keegan, I'll give you the comparative for Same Property. We were expecting about a 90-basis point increase year-over-year in revenue from transient RV. That is on a base of approximately 7.5% to 8% fewer site nights. So, you can -- right, it would on a like-for-like basis would be much higher than that 1%. But as John mentioned or maybe I mentioned during -- in my section of the script, we are expecting another very strong year of conversions from transient sites to annual leases. Of the 3,100 at the high end, 60% is expected on the RV side. And this is right, once you've converted that site, you have a resident there for on average a five-or-plus year period of time. That is very likely making improvements to that site and bringing up the value of the community itself or being hyper-focused on continuing the conversion program over to the annual side. I don't have that broken out here in front of me. We can follow up, that's a very quick follow-up with you after the call. And on the lease termination, we did mention in my remarks, we did rationalize some space in our main office and got out of two floors in our offices here in Southfield."

            "content": "Thank you, Gary. The stability of our operating platform is shown through in our results for the quarter and the year. MH and RV Same Property NOI increased by 4.4% in the quarter. 4.9% growth in revenues reflected a 5% increase in weighted average monthly rent and a 180-basis point occupancy gain. 5.8% increase in expenses was primarily related to turnover costs in our rental program, as one consequence of the pandemic was lengthened average stay and therefore, higher related refurbishment costs. Having turned over these units, we are now able to realize higher rents on incoming leases. For the full year, Same Property MH and RV NOI grew 5.4%, driven by a 5.7% increase in revenue and a 6.2% increase in expenses. The strength of our portfolio is a direct result of our irreplaceable locations, the hard work of our team members and our continued reinvestment in our communities. At our RV communities, we set another annual record for site conversions to annual leases. Full year transient Same Property RV revenues grew by 3.1%, reflecting an average rate of growth of 14.1%, despite an almost 10% reduction in available site nights from the strategic conversion of transient sites to annual leases. Occupancy in our Same Property MH and RV portfolio remained strong, increasing 180 basis points during 2022 to end the year at 98.6%. Park Holidays' portfolio is performing above our original underwriting, and the management team has done an excellent job integrating into Sun. The fourth quarter continued to show strength. For the 31 properties Park Holidays has owned since at least January 2021, home sales rose 17%. Full year weighted average rental rates increased 5.4%, driving a 24% increase in home revenues. Marina has exceeded our expectations with a 10.4% increase in same marina NOI during the quarter and a 7.7% increase for the full year. The outperformance is due to higher demand for wet slips and dry storage spaces. Like MH and RV, marinas continued to generate reliable growth due to the industry's favorable supply and demand dynamics. In terms of external growth, during 2022 and through the date of this call, Sun acquired 70 operating properties for $2.2 billion and spent approximately $62 million for developable land parcels. The acquired land can support over 2,500 future MH and RV sites. Development is in Sun's DNA. For the full year 2022, Sun delivered approximately 1,160 expansion sites at 11 existing communities and over 840 sites at six development communities in the U.S. for a total of 2,000 future revenue-producing sites. Looking ahead, we have a solid development and expansion pipeline that can deliver accretive growth for years to come as well as the proven skill set and platform to sustain our growth. Going forward, we will focus on delivering two to three new MH developments each year as well as continued expansions at our existing properties. With regard to home sales, our average new home selling price in the U.S. was $196,000 for the quarter, reflecting the high demand at and strategic locations at our properties. Within our MH and RV portfolio, we gained over 2,900 revenue-producing sites for the year. Total portfolio occupancy of 96.8% includes newly delivered development and expansion sites. Included in our revenue-producing site gains were over 2,250 transient RV annual lease conversions this year, a new record for Sun. We received an approximate 50% uplift in revenue in the first full year after conversion. Value proposition of an RV vacation one to three hours from home opens Sun to new customers who discover or rediscover the joy of a long-term RV experience. With regard to the three properties most directly affected by Hurricane Ian, I would note that the cleanup is complete, and we have started the rebuilding process. We relocated as many people as possible to other properties, including our team members in the area. We have recently received our first permit to place new homes, and our new home sales program is largely set in anticipation of reopening sites in the second half of the year. Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the entire Sun team for the privilege to serve as our President for the past eight years and as Chief Operating Officer since 2008. We are an unparalleled team that has assembled a best-in-class portfolio and operating platform that has delivered impressive results over many years and continues to be positioned for future growth. As I assume my new responsibilities focusing on our MH development efforts, I look forward to supporting Bruce and the entire team. I will now turn it over to Fernando to discuss our financial results in more detail. Fernando? $196,000. Yes. I mean with respect to U.K. home sales, I mean, our team over there sold over 2,900 houses in 2022, which is a 23% increase year-over-year. So, like Gary said, the demand continues to be very strong, so much so that we -- I think we shared before that we've built out almost 700 expansion sites over the course finishing in 2022, that all sold up in 2022, and look to expand another 500 going into the season this year, which will be filled up by the end of 2023. So really, really strong demand. And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that there's higher costs for basic items, which has caused more people to holiday domestically in the U.K. rather than go to Europe. We're fortunate that the higher income earners in the U.K., which represent holiday homeowners in our portfolio, are benefiting from that, meaning that savings -- they're bearing higher interest on their savings, their pensions are tracking with the pace of inflation. And as we shared with the original information we provided on the deal, Brexit still makes it difficult to travel in the continent. It's gotten more expensive. The pound is still devalued in comparison to this time last year, and it's -- most people travel within two hours to get to the properties. And so -- and then the other thing that I would add is looking out into 2023 from a strength perspective, 90% of our owners have already paid their 2023 pitch fees in full are committed on direct debit. So, things are rock-solid. And I would just emphasize the point that Gary made in his answer, which is that this has a lot more to do with what events are taking place across the world, okay? This is less of a Sun issue, an asset class issue or anything like that. I mean you look at everything, whether it's earthquakes in Turkey and so forth that's impacting the cost of insurance for everybody. And really, that's -- I think that sort of everybody is, for lack of better words, the beneficiary of those events happening in the form of higher costs. Yes. I mean it's -- Keegan, it's really it's a balanced conversation, which is to say, obviously, looking at what expense growth is and applying to passing that on to our residents, but we view rent increases like a marathon versus a sprint. As we've shared before, I think folks have heard me say it 100 times is that the most expensive site we have in our portfolio is a vacant one. And I think our strategy has really stood the test of time. For 25-plus years, we've delivered positive revenue and NOI growth every year when others have seen ups and downs. We continue to deliver long-term cash flow stability. We maintain a solid relationship with our resident base, which is also our sales force. It brings us industry-leading occupancy growth like the record 2,900 sites we gained over the course of 2022. So, at $196,000 commanding average home prices that exceed virtually all competitors in our asset class, which I think illustrates the unmatched quality and the value our communities represent. So really, in summary, our strategy is well balanced, we believe, across all stakeholders, including our residents that live in well-maintained communities and create value in their homes. And so, it's something that we watch and talk about very closely as we think about what increases and how we can push further on both MH and RV. No. I mean it's not really discounts to push the volume, but I think when we walked in, I think part of the investment thesis that we shared in the beginning was the fact that we might thin the margin a little bit to gain more sites and gain more ongoing revenue, okay, on those sites. And so basically, we're just executing the plan that we set out to do. They're actually trending a little bit ahead of this past year, which of course, as we shared before, is great because that is the feeder for more holiday home sales and more rent paying sites. Almost none. Sure. I think from the booking pace perspective, right now, we are trending just a little bit ahead of last year, which is great. We are nearly 95% booked, which is better than we were at this time last year for Q1. So, we're running a little bit ahead. But if you look out into the whole year, we're a little bit ahead in total booking pace, meaning bookings that have actually happened at this point in time versus where we were last year. That's a result of adding sites to the portfolio through expansion. Thank you."

At this time, management would like me to inform you that certain statements made during this call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although, the company believes expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can provide no assurance that its expectations will be achieved.

The company undertakes no obligation to advise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release. Having said that, I would like to introduce management with us today, Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John McLaren, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Fernando Castro-Caratini, Chief Financial Officer. After their remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, management asks that you limit yourself to two questions, so everyone who would like to participate has ample opportunity. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our third quarter 2022 results and provide an update of our full year guidance. I would first like to share my best wishes and support for everyone affected by Hurricane Ian. The swift, organized response of our Sun team members in the preparation and cleanup from the hurricane was remarkable and selfless. We are pleased with our results this quarter and year-to-date, and our outperformance demonstrates both the resilience of our properties and our strength as operators. Our portfolio of best-in-class assets in high demand locations is strategically positioned to continue creating value for stakeholders through varying economic cycles. Our proven track record of execution, facilitated by an operational platform, which is second to none, allows Sun to provide continued growth. Our third quarter was exceptionally strong, exceeding the high end of our guidance. As Fernando will detail, we are raising our midpoint of full year FFO guidance. Resilience of each business segment is evident in our results. Manufactured housing, Same Property NOI increased 4.9% for the quarter compared to last year, supported by 4.3% gains in monthly base rent per site, increased occupancy and our ability to manage expenses. Importantly, our UK operations, which are included in our manufactured housing segment, are performing in line with expectations, demonstrating continued resilience amid economic uncertainty. Park Holidays team has been operating the portfolio since 2005 and are cycle tested, having demonstrated consistent execution and value creation through various economic conditions. Similar to how we see new residents trading into manufactured housing in the U.S. during times of economic challenges, we are experiencing continued strong demand for domestic holiday homes in the UK. RV communities continue to experience high demand and transient conversions to annual leases accelerated 30% as compared to the third quarter of 2021. Year-to-date, we have converted approximately 2,000 transient sites to annual leases, which exceeds our full year record set in 2021. Each conversion equates to a 40% to 60% revenue uplift the first year and creates a new stream of recurring revenue. On a Same Property basis, annual RV revenues increased 13.4% and total NOI grew 8.4% compared to the third quarter last year. Monthly base rent per RV site increased by 7% year-over-year. On a combined basis, blended total portfolio manufactured housing and annual RV occupancy was 97.1%, with over 2,300 revenue-producing sites gained year-to-date. Looking ahead to 2023, we are positioned for continued organic growth in manufactured housing and RV as we expect to realize average rental rate increases of 6.3% for manufactured housing and 7.8% for annual RV at the midpoint, both represent material increases on a year-over-year basis. Marinas continued to experience strong performance. Same Marina real property NOI increased 9.6% in the third quarter compared to last year, driven by increased annual boat slip revenue and storage revenue. Demand for slips and storage is persistent and over 85% of the Safe Harbor Marinas have waitlist to join as a member. In terms of external growth, we are and will remain very selective in approaching new opportunities. Since our second quarter earnings call in July, we have closed on $24 million of new acquisitions. We also sold one RV community in California for $15 million. Our development platform continues to be a differentiating and exciting growth driver over the long-term, and we are pleased to have John focused on the pipeline of manufactured housing development communities. During the quarter, we delivered over 170 expansion and greenfield development sites. On the ESG side, we are proud to report that our GRESB score came back in the mid-60% range, which represents a 42% improvement from last year's score. This was only our second year of participating in GRESB and we are pleased to be scoring in line with our peers. Our team continues to work hard to build on this momentum as we enhance our ESG protocols and reporting. To scale, the quality and locations of Sun's properties, along with our unrivaled team, gives Sun a clear competitive advantage through all economic cycles. We are well positioned to continue delivering value to our stakeholders through our proven resilient platform. I would like to thank all of our team members for their ongoing contributions and efforts, which makes Sun what it is today. I also want to congratulate Bruce Thelen, who will take over the Chief Operating Officer role in 2023. Since joining the company in 2018, Bruce has been a vital member of Sun's leadership team. He has consistently grown his responsibilities related to manufactured housing and RV property operations. Bruce and John have worked together overseeing the operations team, and I look forward to Bruce's continued leadership. I will now turn the call over to John and Fernando to speak to our third quarter results in detail. John?\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. Third quarter results have demonstrated Sun's resilience. For the quarter, Same Property manufactured housing and RV NOI increased 6.4%, driven by a 4.7% increase in monthly base rents per site and a 200 basis point increase in occupancy. Same Property manufactured housing communities recorded a 4.6% increase in revenue and a 4.9% increase in NOI for the quarter compared to the prior year period. Annual RV revenue increased 13.4% in the quarter due to the record number of transient annual lease conversions continuing to build on the success we have been delivering. The record transient to annual conversions, Gary mentioned, translated into having almost 7% fewer sites to rent during the third quarter. Notwithstanding this fact, we increased transient RV revenue 60 basis points during the quarter. Marina's Same Property NOI increased by 9.6% for the third quarter, which was 60 basis points ahead of the high end of guidance. The outperformance was largely driven by increased operating revenue from wet slips and dry storage space demand and expense savings across the portfolio. Our UK portfolio performed well and we are experiencing continued strong demand for holiday homes. Additionally, Park Holidays has proactively locked in utility costs through 2024, which will benefit our residents. The integration of our UK operations continues to advance smoothly and we’ll continue to realize synergies between our team systems, technologies and methodologies over time. Development and expansion activity remains an important contributor to our long-term growth. We continue to entitle land and locations with high structural demand in order to maintain a robust pipeline of future embedded growth. Accordingly, in the quarter and through the date of this call, we purchased four fully entitled manufactured housing land parcels for a total of $20 million that provide an opportunity to develop approximately 800 additional sites. During the quarter, Sun sold 724 new and pre-owned homes in our communities. New home sales prices average $183,000 for the quarter up $31,000 from the prior year. This 21% increase in the past year reflects the high quality and demand to live in a Sun community. The demand to live in a Sun community is also evident as total portfolio Manufactured Housing and RV occupancy reached 97.1% as of September 30. The average rental rate increases for 2023 are expected to be between 6.2% and 6.4% across our MH portfolio, excluding the UK where we expect an average rent increase in the range is 7.2% to 7.4%. For annual RV, we expect rental rate increases of 7.7% to 7.9% and a range of 7.3% to 7.6% increases in Marina rents. As previously disclosed, Hurricane Ian caused significant flooding and wind damage at three RV properties and damage to the sea wall and docks at one Marina all located near Fort Myers, Florida. Prior to the hurricane making landfall, we acted our emergency plan. Our team members, along with third party contractors began restoration work as soon as it was safe to return on site, reorganized convoys of supplies, food and travel trailers to our Florida properties. We cannot be more proud of the entire team and effectively managing through a challenging situation. We expect that our property casualty flood and business interrupt insurance will fully cover us net of deductibles. We are grateful for and humbled by the dedication of our team members and pleased with the company’s performance today. I will now turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our financial results in more detail. Fernando?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, John. For the third quarter, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share on a constant currency basis of $2.71, a 28% increase above prior year results and exceeding the high end of our quarterly guidance range. The outperformance was driven by total Marina Real Property, net operating income, interest income, UK corporate tax favorability and lower corporate costs. As of September 30, Sun had $6.7 billion of debt outstanding that carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and has a weighted average maturity of 8.8 years. As of quarter end, our net debt to trailing 12 month recurring EBITDA ratio was 5.7x. Excluding our bank revolving credit and term loan facilities, the remaining $4.9 billion of debt has a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and a weighted average maturity of 9.9 years. In terms of capital markets activity during the quarter, we repaid $318 million of debt secured by 35 properties, increasing our unencumbered assets to total asset ratio to nearly 79%. We are also in the process of executing on approximately $310 million of mortgage refinancings for a portfolio of properties, which is expected to reduce our variable rate debt exposure to approximately 16%. As mentioned on our last call in July, we swapped GBP400 million of our GBP875 million debt outstanding on our term loan from variable rate to fixed rate through 2025. Lastly, since our second quarter call, we settled all remaining forward equity agreements on approximately 540,000 shares for $95 million in net proceeds. In total for the quarter, we settled 1.5 million shares that netted approximately $276 million of proceeds used to pay down borrowings on our credit facility. Turning to guidance. As summarized in yesterday’s press release, we are increasing the midpoint of full year guidance on constant currency FFO per share by $0.08 to a revised range of $7.32 to $7.38. We are establishing fourth quarter 2022 constant currency core FFO per share guidance in the range of $1.23 to $1.29. At the same property level, we are moderating our full year Manufactured Housing and RV NOI growth expectations by 40 basis points, primarily reflecting revised transient RV revenue expectations for the fourth quarter. The new range represents 6% growth at the midpoint for the full year and implies the 6.6% growth at the midpoint in the fourth quarter. For Marina same-property, we are increasing the midpoint of full year guidance to 6.6%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior range. In the fourth quarter, we expect same-property Marina growth of 6.1% at the midpoint. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions, dispositions and capital markets activity through October 24 and the approximately $310 million of debt financing we are in the process of closing, but it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. So maybe starting on the home sales. If we look at the U.S. they obviously declined year-over-year. How are you thinking about that? Is that a leading indicator of overall demand for the MH portfolio at all?\nJohn McLaren: Hey, Nick, it’s John. Good morning. Hope you’re well. The answer to that is no. On the new home side, primarily what we saw was timing associated with the hurricane, which actually happened on the 28 of September. So it’s just as we were closing out the third quarter and it pushed out anticipated closings that we had lined up in Florida for the – into the fourth quarter. So we’re seeing those closed. It also had an impact on the margin since some of those higher margin sales are associated with those sales, so we expect to pick those back up in the fourth quarter. On the pre-owned side, really it has to do with – fewer residents who want to sell their homes, which gives us less inventory to resell that tracks the same with fewer broker transaction. I think it really speaks again, to the best in class quality of our communities. The lifestyles that our residents have and they’re holding onto their homes is staying longer even as home values continue to increase. So no indicator whatsoever. Just a little bit of timing.\nGary Shiffman: And Nick this is Gary. It’s Gary. I would just add. What’s the average price…\nJohn McLaren: $183,000, which is industry leading home prices.\nGary Shiffman: So I think that’s a good indicator. It’s more of a timing issue.\nNick Joseph: That’s helpful. And then just similar question on the UK side and the impact of the higher mortgage rates and some resets there and how you think that will impact home sales for Park Holidays?\nJohn McLaren: Well, I can tell you Nick that through the first nine months of the year Park Holidays year-over-year growth and home sales is 13%, so very strong demand continues.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then just finally, for the $310 million of mortgage debt, what’s the expected rate on that?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Nick, that’s going to be between 4.5% and 4.6%.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you walk us through the factors that are bringing down the MH and RV same property NOI guidance? I think you mentioned transient revenue as a factor. And just while touching on transient revenue, it looks like same property transient revenue was up 60 basis points, which is the same as last quarter. So after a strong year of transient revenue in 2021 and flat – kind of flattish this year, have we kind of hit the peak of where transient revenue can be?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hi Michael, it’s Fernando. So the main component to bringing the range downward for the full year – for moderating that growth for the full year in 2022 is increased – is our expectations for the transient revenue line item. That – there are two effects to that. One, it’s the record number of conversions that we’ve had in the portfolio with almost 2,000 conversions year-to-date, which surpasses last year’s record by almost 20%, and we expect that to continue to climb into the fourth quarter. And you stated it in your question, right? We had a record 2021 on the transient revenue side. So – or expecting a moderation, right, of growth moving forward. And that’s settling into, say, pre-pandemic levels, where, on a same-property basis, that – the transient revenue line item was growing at about 3% per year. Our full year transient growth expectations, inclusive of the fourth quarter, would now be around 3.5% for 2022.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And sticking with Fernando, on the topic of expense growth, it was very well controlled in the quarter with 1% growth to down from – a deceleration from 7.3% last quarter. So, what are the factors that kind of went into the expense control? Was it elevated growth last year a factor? And I guess maybe more importantly, how sustainable are – is growth at this kind of like low single-digit levels?\nJohn McLaren: Sure. Thanks, Michael. So the primary driver for the lower operating expense growth would be on payroll, and that would be due to two factors. One is the roll-off of the increase that we put in place in July of 2021, which rolled off at the end of the second quarter. So a more moderate growth from that perspective from that onetime increase. And then in the third quarter, we did put in place some cost containment strategies on the payroll side and on the utility side across MH, RV and Marina. On a year-to-date basis, our expense growth for MH, RV is now at 6.3% and the same percentage for the Marina side. So certainly not expecting, say, 1% growth on a year-over-year basis moving forward, but did put in place some strategies to combat say inflationary pressures that we were seeing at the portfolio.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird.\nWes Golladay: Hey. Good morning everyone [Technical Difficulty]. With the – I guess, if you were to strip out the conversion, would you still be looking at a high single-digit revenue growth from that segment? You’ve kind of referred to the 3.5% long-term average, but I’m trying to gauge if that’s more of a high single-digit number on an apples-to-apples basis. And then I guess maybe when you look at the utility expenses, what are you looking at next year when you factor in some of these savings that you can implement?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: On the, let’s say, same-site basis for the third quarter in transient. So removing – stripping the impact of the conversions for the quarter. Growth would have been somewhere between 2% and 3%. So that answers the first question. From a utilities perspective, we have put in place – we put in place CapEx from a containment standpoint that also helps on the environmental side, be that converting the entire portfolio over to LED. We’ve put in 13 arrays to 15 arrays – solar power arrays in California and are evaluating additional 13 arrays to 15 arrays in Arizona and Texas and a few other states. So those are some of the investments that we’re looking at to contain utility costs moving forward.\nGary Shiffman: The other one I’d add, Fernando, while the remote WiFi static controls on all of our club houses or vacation rentals where we can actually control the thermostat settings, the weekends and over the nine new states has made a significant difference.\nJohn McLaren: The only other thing I’d add, Wes, this is John. In most cases, our portfolio utility costs are passed on. Our residents, frankly, are in the same boat as any one single family, but frankly, they have an advantage because our homes are typically smaller and cost less from a utility perspective. So, I think that, that’s an important point to bring up as well as on transient side of business, we capture those increases in the formal rates that we charge for those sites.\nWes Golladay: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, where capital markets are today, would you consider stepping up the asset recycling to fund your acquisitions of UK properties and I guess, more marinas at this point?\nGary Shiffman: Sorry, Wes, this is Gary. I missed the beginning of the question.\nWes Golladay: I’m saying with capital markets, where they’re at now, equity is obviously not an attractive price sale where the stock is today, but you are still selling a few MH properties. What is the appetite to sell more MH to fund your growth in the new venture in the UK and more marinas?\nGary Shiffman: Sure. I think that – great question. Certainly, capital allocation and the cost of capital is front and center on this company as well as many of the platforms that are out there today as rates. But I think what I would suggest is that our balance sheet has never been stronger. We have strong annual cash flow. I think, in general, we expect to see less cap rate expansion in our asset classes just due to the higher demand. We’re interested in the assets through the fact that they have historically demonstrated cash flow stability, resilience and strength through all economic cycles. We have seen cap rate expansion in what I’d call a less than institutional quality properties that some would not be interested in, and we look towards dispositions when we feel the properties cannot contribute the same amount of growth as the balance of the portfolio. Oftentimes, those properties come to us as part of a larger transaction. So, I think that we’re always looking at asset managing our properties, but there is no inclination at this time to sell properties and acquire properties in the UK. In the UK, we won’t lose any opportunities. We’ve actually been able to cherry-pick, if you will, 14 property acquisitions since we bought the Park Holidays platform. So plenty of opportunity there with higher yields, higher opportunities. So, while we always take a look at dispositions and reallocation of our capital, there’s nothing that I would point to right now. Including, fact of the matter is that the pound is down against the dollar, giving us theoretical greater buying power over there. But as we look at things on a currency basis, that’s not something that we are looking specifically to take advantage of. We’re really very, very disciplined watching cost of capital and matching it up and see opportunity to invest going forward. So that’s our approach. Last thing I’d add is the fact that if this had to come at a time when we were more pencils down on the sideline watching for opportunities. We got an abundance of growth to extract from the large amount of acquisitions we’ve executed on over the last 12, 18 months. So a lot of internal opportunity as well as the opportunities related to expansion and development that John’s working on.\nWes Golladay: Yes, great. Thanks for the time, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Good morning. Thanks for the time. I just have a few follow-up questions on the UK business. John, you mentioned home sales were up 13% year-to-date. Could you give us that same statistic for the third quarter?\nJohn McLaren: Actually, John, don’t have that figure right in front of me. We can follow back up to you on that. Apologize. The same – call it the same store figure for home sale revenue was up around 13% for the third quarter.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. For the third quarter, all right. And then can you just give us a sense, Fernando or John, what drove the reduced guidance for the UK NOI guidance that on the – even on a constant currency basis?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: So John, I think the primary driver there would be a small adjustment to the seasonality of the Park Leisure transaction. As you’ll remember, that closed at the end of the second quarter. And that’s about $1 million shifting from the second quarter to the third. But on a constant currency basis for the third quarter, we did perform in line with our expectations. So nothing more from that perspective.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Last one for me, just on two more volatile cash flow strains of the UK business, the holiday rentals and holiday home sales. I’m aware of the long-term track record of UK, the Park Holidays team they want to grow the home sales. I’m just curious, every recession is different. So when you talk to the Park Holidays management team where they say reasonable bear cases for home sales and holiday rentals, NOI streams if we are on the precipice of a recession?\nGary Shiffman: John, I think the way I’d answer that is, I know there’s a lot of discussion about the macro headwinds that are out there. But I kind of view it that’s it be a tailwind. Okay. And then for us, and before of the thesis that we shared when we announce the acquisition originally as an example, it is more difficult because of Brexit to travel to the continent. Now it’s gotten more expensive because of the pound devaluation. It’s still fragmented, still affordable vacation, and it’s still easy for most people going there because of traveling within a two-hour radius to get to the properties. And it’s a very established common form of vacation that takes place in the UK. And so, I think that, we started seeing higher inflation and things like that. But in the face of that, we’re growing home sales in the UK. So I think that looking down the road, I mean, obviously, we’ll have guidance when we come out with our fourth quarter results in February. But I think the thesis holds for everything that we thought when we acquired the portfolio back in April.\nJohn Pawlowski: All right. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Kim: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify the four properties impacted by Ian are not operational and there’s taken out of the same store pool, is that the case?\nGary Shiffman: Hi, John. The three RV properties are currently not operational and would be taken out of the same store pool from a performance standpoint. We will consistent with prior practice. We will be putting in an adjustment for the expected business interruption proceeds that we expect to receive for those three properties in the fourth quarter. So they would be out of same property. But the productivity or the expected productivity net of any deductibles would be in our earnings. We would then at some point in the future actually collect on the proceeds from business interruption.\nJohn Kim: And any clarification you have on the payment of the business interruption insurance? I know you’ve kind of netted that out on your charge for the quarter. But I also wanted to ask on a similar question on the ad back that you had on the charge to Core FFO? I realize it’s kind of deemed as a one-time item, but hurricanes seem like it’s occurring more than once in a while in Florida. So I’m just wondering, if you had considered this more of a cost of doing business rather than a one-time item?\nJohn McLaren: Yes, John, I view – this is John. I view it as a one-time item. We don’t deal with events of this magnitude very often. And the last time we dealt with the storm of this magnitude was five years ago. Before that probably a decade or more, I mean, Ian was the first one I dealt with [indiscernible].\nJohn Kim: And then how confident are you on this $17.7 million of insurance proceeds?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: That is – at this time, that is our best estimate of what we will recover from an insurance perspective. We’ll update the market if those estimates were to change.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, sir.\nSamir Khanal: Hey, Gary or John. I guess on the MH front, given where CPI is running sort of over 8% and then you have the adjustment to social security. Was there the ability to maybe even push rates higher on the MH side? Maybe walk us through kind of your process of getting that 6.5% push to the residents at this time?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. Hey, Samir, it’s John. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Here’s how we think about it. We view rent increases like a marathon versus a sprint. I think that I probably shared this Gary a lot of times, but the most expensive site we have in our portfolio is a vacant one. And I think that our strategy has stood the test of time. For over 25 years we’ve delivered positive revenue and NOI growth each and every year, while others have seen the ups and downs. We continue to deliver long-term cash flow stability. We maintain a solid relationship with our resident base, which is also our sales force that brings us an industry leading occupancy growth that we’ve had. And I will add that, at $183,000 a home we command average home sale price that far exceed virtually all competitors in our asset class. I think that illustrates the unmatched quality and value of our communities represent. So I think we view our strategy as well balanced across all of our stakeholders, including our residents who live in a well maintained community and see value creation in their homes. And the bottom line is we have the ability to match our expense increases at over 90% of our MH sites. But for the reasons I just share is why we’re comfortable with the range where we’re at for 2023.\nSamir Khanal: Got it. And then I guess, Fernando, just on the balance sheet just looking at the supplement, I think about 120 million maturities in 2023. Kind of what’s the plan to address that? Is it through primarily refinancing or paying down the debt, maybe you can address that?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thanks, Samir. Good question. Yes, we have, as we look out at our maturities over the course of the last couple years, we have – the next couple of years, we have no looming, no large maturity towers that would, let’s say, rerate our debt stack. As Gary mentioned previously on the call, we have very strong free cash flow growth that in the short term can be used to pay down anything from a revolving credit facility or these maturities coming due. We also from time-to-time have looked to walk in the treasury rate over for future issuances. At this time, we have about 200 million locked in below 3% on the 10-year treasury. So we’ll be looking at pricing that’s more advantageous than what you would get in the market today. But it's all part of our capital strategy. So we do believe that great flexibility with regard to our maturities or any investments that we would make over the course of the next year.\nSamir Khanal: Got it. Thank you very much.\nGary Shiffman: Thank you, Samir.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead sir.\nBrad Heffern: Yes. Thank you, Operator. So on the UK the rate growth outlook was stronger than at least, we had anticipated. I guess how does the 7.2% to 7.4% guidance compare with historical rate growth? And how do you think about balancing higher rates with demand just given the weaker economic backdrop in the UK?\nJohn McLaren: I think what we're seeing with a midpoint of 7.3% is higher. I mean they typically have been in the 5s. So it's markedly higher than it was last year historically. The second part of the question, Brad?\nBrad Heffern: Just how do you think about balancing higher rates with demand given there's obviously a lot of recessionary pressures in the UK?\nJohn McLaren: I think, once again, I'd say what I shared a little bit earlier that I think that with what's going on in the UK and the difficulty to go other places and the devaluation of the pound, I think that frankly, that drives more domestic vacationing. And it drives, as we're seeing with the home sales growth that they've produced over the course of 2022, considerable demand even over last year, which was a pretty record year for them as well as in terms of home sales.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then is there anything that you can share on forward booking trends in the RV business?\nJohn McLaren: I think bookings for Q4 or maybe pacing, and Fernando shared this in guidance, facing slightly below the range last year, but pretty close to tracking the same. We'll provide guidance in terms of what our forward bookings look like into first quarter and second quarter when we release earnings next time around.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead sir.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Everyone a quick question, what drove that incremental $0.11 of business combination expense and other acquisition-related costs and the revised guidance?\nGary Shiffman: Hi Josh, that would be a combination of expenses related to the UK transaction that came in through business combination as well as in the quarter; we did walk away from a number of transactions that would include the deal costs.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Walking away from those deals, was it just related to the cost of capital or just – or something else driving that?\nGary Shiffman: The deal costs are directly related to the fact that cost of capital changed. We negotiated many of these transactions over a period of months getting through due diligence and other forms of getting to closing and as the cost of capital to debt, et cetera increased. We're very disciplined with our expectations with the sellers. As I shared earlier, the sellers' expectations are based on world as it existed six months, 12 months ago. And we believe a lot of those opportunities will come back to us in the future, but matching up the cost of capital with the returns caused us to walk away from numerous deals. And we are still in negotiations at this time on transactions. In some cases, we do get adjustments through satisfactory on the price side of things. But when we don't and we can't justify the yield and the returns, based on the cost of capital, we will walk away from the transactions in a disciplined manner.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Appreciate that. And then one other for me, it looks like G&A increased $7 million quarter-over-quarter. What was kind of driving that uptick?\nJohn McLaren: Uptick, Josh, would be that deal costs are recognized in G&A. So that would be the primary driver in the sequential quarter-over-quarter increase.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. So I guess thinking about for 4Q and beyond, that $7 million kind of reverses. Is that the way to think about it?\nJohn McLaren: That's correct.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Anthony Hau with Truist Securities. Please go ahead sir.\nAnthony Hau: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you guys remind me of the underwriting assumptions for Holiday Park expansions in terms of return, cost per site and lease-up time line? And how many sites do you expect to develop annually over the next couple of years in the UK portfolio?\nJohn McLaren: I think – so for this year, Anthony, it's John. Thanks for the question. This year, we've already completed roughly 700 sites of expansion development in the UK. And I think previously we stated that we expect to stay in that range. Obviously, we'll match that up with demand as we go. I think I have to circle back with you in terms of the economics associated with the – returns associated with those sites, which we would be happy to do.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Anthony, they would – the returns would mirror our expected returns for expansions here in the U.S., so call it in the low teens from an IRR perspective.\nAnthony Hau: Okay. And how long does it usually take to like lease those sites up? Is it similar to the MH portfolio to you in the U.S.?\nJohn McLaren: I think we'd see that those sites to get leased up, along with other vacant sites, they have in the portfolio over the course of a given year that they've developed over the year.\nAnthony Hau: Okay. And my last question is like for G&A. So when the initial guidance came out last year, I think G&A was expected to be $235 million, but it excludes the Park Holidays. I think G&A from Park Holidays is around $25 million to $27 million. So in total, that will be like $260 million. At this current pace, it seems like G&A will be mid $240 million in 2022. So what is the difference between the initial guidance and now?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Anthony, on an annualized basis, if you analyze our year-to-date figure, we would be at around 200 and the low 250s. The low end of our range, inclusive of Park Holidays when we gave guidance, was at about $260 million. There is some translation from a currency perspective with G&A from the UK, to the tune of about $3 million to $4 million in translation. And the rest, we have – we are – we did save over the course of the third quarter on payroll at the corporate level. So we are taking some measures from that perspective with some delayed hiring and things of that nature.\nAnthony Hau: Okay, thanks.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Anthony.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our third quarter 2022 results and provide an update of our full year guidance. I would first like to share my best wishes and support for everyone affected by Hurricane Ian. The swift, organized response of our Sun team members in the preparation and cleanup from the hurricane was remarkable and selfless. We are pleased with our results this quarter and year-to-date, and our outperformance demonstrates both the resilience of our properties and our strength as operators. Our portfolio of best-in-class assets in high demand locations is strategically positioned to continue creating value for stakeholders through varying economic cycles. Our proven track record of execution, facilitated by an operational platform, which is second to none, allows Sun to provide continued growth. Our third quarter was exceptionally strong, exceeding the high end of our guidance. As Fernando will detail, we are raising our midpoint of full year FFO guidance. Resilience of each business segment is evident in our results. Manufactured housing, Same Property NOI increased 4.9% for the quarter compared to last year, supported by 4.3% gains in monthly base rent per site, increased occupancy and our ability to manage expenses. Importantly, our UK operations, which are included in our manufactured housing segment, are performing in line with expectations, demonstrating continued resilience amid economic uncertainty. Park Holidays team has been operating the portfolio since 2005 and are cycle tested, having demonstrated consistent execution and value creation through various economic conditions. Similar to how we see new residents trading into manufactured housing in the U.S. during times of economic challenges, we are experiencing continued strong demand for domestic holiday homes in the UK. RV communities continue to experience high demand and transient conversions to annual leases accelerated 30% as compared to the third quarter of 2021. Year-to-date, we have converted approximately 2,000 transient sites to annual leases, which exceeds our full year record set in 2021. Each conversion equates to a 40% to 60% revenue uplift the first year and creates a new stream of recurring revenue. On a Same Property basis, annual RV revenues increased 13.4% and total NOI grew 8.4% compared to the third quarter last year. Monthly base rent per RV site increased by 7% year-over-year. On a combined basis, blended total portfolio manufactured housing and annual RV occupancy was 97.1%, with over 2,300 revenue-producing sites gained year-to-date. Looking ahead to 2023, we are positioned for continued organic growth in manufactured housing and RV as we expect to realize average rental rate increases of 6.3% for manufactured housing and 7.8% for annual RV at the midpoint, both represent material increases on a year-over-year basis. Marinas continued to experience strong performance. Same Marina real property NOI increased 9.6% in the third quarter compared to last year, driven by increased annual boat slip revenue and storage revenue. Demand for slips and storage is persistent and over 85% of the Safe Harbor Marinas have waitlist to join as a member. In terms of external growth, we are and will remain very selective in approaching new opportunities. Since our second quarter earnings call in July, we have closed on $24 million of new acquisitions. We also sold one RV community in California for $15 million. Our development platform continues to be a differentiating and exciting growth driver over the long-term, and we are pleased to have John focused on the pipeline of manufactured housing development communities. During the quarter, we delivered over 170 expansion and greenfield development sites. On the ESG side, we are proud to report that our GRESB score came back in the mid-60% range, which represents a 42% improvement from last year's score. This was only our second year of participating in GRESB and we are pleased to be scoring in line with our peers. Our team continues to work hard to build on this momentum as we enhance our ESG protocols and reporting. To scale, the quality and locations of Sun's properties, along with our unrivaled team, gives Sun a clear competitive advantage through all economic cycles. We are well positioned to continue delivering value to our stakeholders through our proven resilient platform. I would like to thank all of our team members for their ongoing contributions and efforts, which makes Sun what it is today. I also want to congratulate Bruce Thelen, who will take over the Chief Operating Officer role in 2023. Since joining the company in 2018, Bruce has been a vital member of Sun's leadership team. He has consistently grown his responsibilities related to manufactured housing and RV property operations. Bruce and John have worked together overseeing the operations team, and I look forward to Bruce's continued leadership. I will now turn the call over to John and Fernando to speak to our third quarter results in detail. John? And Nick this is Gary. It's Gary. I would just add. What's the average price... So I think that's a good indicator. It's more of a timing issue. The other one I'd add, Fernando, while the remote WiFi static controls on all of our club houses or vacation rentals where we can actually control the thermostat settings, the weekends and over the nine new states has made a significant difference. Sorry, Wes, this is Gary. I missed the beginning of the question. Sure. I think that – great question. Certainly, capital allocation and the cost of capital is front and center on this company as well as many of the platforms that are out there today as rates. But I think what I would suggest is that our balance sheet has never been stronger. We have strong annual cash flow. I think, in general, we expect to see less cap rate expansion in our asset classes just due to the higher demand. We're interested in the assets through the fact that they have historically demonstrated cash flow stability, resilience and strength through all economic cycles. We have seen cap rate expansion in what I'd call a less than institutional quality properties that some would not be interested in, and we look towards dispositions when we feel the properties cannot contribute the same amount of growth as the balance of the portfolio. Oftentimes, those properties come to us as part of a larger transaction. So, I think that we're always looking at asset managing our properties, but there is no inclination at this time to sell properties and acquire properties in the UK. In the UK, we won't lose any opportunities. We've actually been able to cherry-pick, if you will, 14 property acquisitions since we bought the Park Holidays platform. So plenty of opportunity there with higher yields, higher opportunities. So, while we always take a look at dispositions and reallocation of our capital, there's nothing that I would point to right now. Including, fact of the matter is that the pound is down against the dollar, giving us theoretical greater buying power over there. But as we look at things on a currency basis, that's not something that we are looking specifically to take advantage of. We're really very, very disciplined watching cost of capital and matching it up and see opportunity to invest going forward. So that's our approach. Last thing I'd add is the fact that if this had to come at a time when we were more pencils down on the sideline watching for opportunities. We got an abundance of growth to extract from the large amount of acquisitions we've executed on over the last 12, 18 months. So a lot of internal opportunity as well as the opportunities related to expansion and development that John's working on. John, I think the way I'd answer that is, I know there's a lot of discussion about the macro headwinds that are out there. But I kind of view it that's it be a tailwind. Okay. And then for us, and before of the thesis that we shared when we announce the acquisition originally as an example, it is more difficult because of Brexit to travel to the continent. Now it's gotten more expensive because of the pound devaluation. It's still fragmented, still affordable vacation, and it's still easy for most people going there because of traveling within a two-hour radius to get to the properties. And it's a very established common form of vacation that takes place in the UK. And so, I think that, we started seeing higher inflation and things like that. But in the face of that, we're growing home sales in the UK. So I think that looking down the road, I mean, obviously, we'll have guidance when we come out with our fourth quarter results in February. But I think the thesis holds for everything that we thought when we acquired the portfolio back in April. Hi, John. The three RV properties are currently not operational and would be taken out of the same store pool from a performance standpoint. We will consistent with prior practice. We will be putting in an adjustment for the expected business interruption proceeds that we expect to receive for those three properties in the fourth quarter. So they would be out of same property. But the productivity or the expected productivity net of any deductibles would be in our earnings. We would then at some point in the future actually collect on the proceeds from business interruption. Thank you, Samir. Hi Josh, that would be a combination of expenses related to the UK transaction that came in through business combination as well as in the quarter; we did walk away from a number of transactions that would include the deal costs. The deal costs are directly related to the fact that cost of capital changed. We negotiated many of these transactions over a period of months getting through due diligence and other forms of getting to closing and as the cost of capital to debt, et cetera increased. We're very disciplined with our expectations with the sellers. As I shared earlier, the sellers' expectations are based on world as it existed six months, 12 months ago. And we believe a lot of those opportunities will come back to us in the future, but matching up the cost of capital with the returns caused us to walk away from numerous deals. And we are still in negotiations at this time on transactions. In some cases, we do get adjustments through satisfactory on the price side of things. But when we don't and we can't justify the yield and the returns, based on the cost of capital, we will walk away from the transactions in a disciplined manner. I want to thank everyone for participating on the call today and remind everyone that John, myself and Fernando and Stephanie are all available for any follow-up questions that you might have. And we certainly look forward to sharing results year-end fourth quarter. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, John. For the third quarter, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share on a constant currency basis of $2.71, a 28% increase above prior year results and exceeding the high end of our quarterly guidance range. The outperformance was driven by total Marina Real Property, net operating income, interest income, UK corporate tax favorability and lower corporate costs. As of September 30, Sun had $6.7 billion of debt outstanding that carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and has a weighted average maturity of 8.8 years. As of quarter end, our net debt to trailing 12 month recurring EBITDA ratio was 5.7x. Excluding our bank revolving credit and term loan facilities, the remaining $4.9 billion of debt has a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and a weighted average maturity of 9.9 years. In terms of capital markets activity during the quarter, we repaid $318 million of debt secured by 35 properties, increasing our unencumbered assets to total asset ratio to nearly 79%. We are also in the process of executing on approximately $310 million of mortgage refinancings for a portfolio of properties, which is expected to reduce our variable rate debt exposure to approximately 16%. As mentioned on our last call in July, we swapped GBP400 million of our GBP875 million debt outstanding on our term loan from variable rate to fixed rate through 2025. Lastly, since our second quarter call, we settled all remaining forward equity agreements on approximately 540,000 shares for $95 million in net proceeds. In total for the quarter, we settled 1.5 million shares that netted approximately $276 million of proceeds used to pay down borrowings on our credit facility. Turning to guidance. As summarized in yesterday's press release, we are increasing the midpoint of full year guidance on constant currency FFO per share by $0.08 to a revised range of $7.32 to $7.38. We are establishing fourth quarter 2022 constant currency core FFO per share guidance in the range of $1.23 to $1.29. At the same property level, we are moderating our full year Manufactured Housing and RV NOI growth expectations by 40 basis points, primarily reflecting revised transient RV revenue expectations for the fourth quarter. The new range represents 6% growth at the midpoint for the full year and implies the 6.6% growth at the midpoint in the fourth quarter. For Marina same-property, we are increasing the midpoint of full year guidance to 6.6%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior range. In the fourth quarter, we expect same-property Marina growth of 6.1% at the midpoint. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions, dispositions and capital markets activity through October 24 and the approximately $310 million of debt financing we are in the process of closing, but it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for questions. Operator? Nick, that's going to be between 4.5% and 4.6%. Hi Michael, it's Fernando. So the main component to bringing the range downward for the full year – for moderating that growth for the full year in 2022 is increased – is our expectations for the transient revenue line item. That – there are two effects to that. One, it's the record number of conversions that we've had in the portfolio with almost 2,000 conversions year-to-date, which surpasses last year's record by almost 20%, and we expect that to continue to climb into the fourth quarter. And you stated it in your question, right? We had a record 2021 on the transient revenue side. So – or expecting a moderation, right, of growth moving forward. And that's settling into, say, pre-pandemic levels, where, on a same-property basis, that – the transient revenue line item was growing at about 3% per year. Our full year transient growth expectations, inclusive of the fourth quarter, would now be around 3.5% for 2022. On the, let's say, same-site basis for the third quarter in transient. So removing – stripping the impact of the conversions for the quarter. Growth would have been somewhere between 2% and 3%. So that answers the first question. From a utilities perspective, we have put in place – we put in place CapEx from a containment standpoint that also helps on the environmental side, be that converting the entire portfolio over to LED. We've put in 13 arrays to 15 arrays – solar power arrays in California and are evaluating additional 13 arrays to 15 arrays in Arizona and Texas and a few other states. So those are some of the investments that we're looking at to contain utility costs moving forward. So John, I think the primary driver there would be a small adjustment to the seasonality of the Park Leisure transaction. As you'll remember, that closed at the end of the second quarter. And that's about $1 million shifting from the second quarter to the third. But on a constant currency basis for the third quarter, we did perform in line with our expectations. So nothing more from that perspective. That is – at this time, that is our best estimate of what we will recover from an insurance perspective. We'll update the market if those estimates were to change. Thanks, Samir. Good question. Yes, we have, as we look out at our maturities over the course of the last couple years, we have – the next couple of years, we have no looming, no large maturity towers that would, let's say, rerate our debt stack. As Gary mentioned previously on the call, we have very strong free cash flow growth that in the short term can be used to pay down anything from a revolving credit facility or these maturities coming due. We also from time-to-time have looked to walk in the treasury rate over for future issuances. At this time, we have about 200 million locked in below 3% on the 10-year treasury. So we'll be looking at pricing that's more advantageous than what you would get in the market today. But it's all part of our capital strategy. So we do believe that great flexibility with regard to our maturities or any investments that we would make over the course of the next year. Anthony, they would – the returns would mirror our expected returns for expansions here in the U.S., so call it in the low teens from an IRR perspective. Anthony, on an annualized basis, if you analyze our year-to-date figure, we would be at around 200 and the low 250s. The low end of our range, inclusive of Park Holidays when we gave guidance, was at about $260 million. There is some translation from a currency perspective with G&A from the UK, to the tune of about $3 million to $4 million in translation. And the rest, we have – we are – we did save over the course of the third quarter on payroll at the corporate level. So we are taking some measures from that perspective with some delayed hiring and things of that nature. Thank you, Anthony."

            "name": "John McLaren",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Third quarter results have demonstrated Sun's resilience. For the quarter, Same Property manufactured housing and RV NOI increased 6.4%, driven by a 4.7% increase in monthly base rents per site and a 200 basis point increase in occupancy. Same Property manufactured housing communities recorded a 4.6% increase in revenue and a 4.9% increase in NOI for the quarter compared to the prior year period. Annual RV revenue increased 13.4% in the quarter due to the record number of transient annual lease conversions continuing to build on the success we have been delivering. The record transient to annual conversions, Gary mentioned, translated into having almost 7% fewer sites to rent during the third quarter. Notwithstanding this fact, we increased transient RV revenue 60 basis points during the quarter. Marina's Same Property NOI increased by 9.6% for the third quarter, which was 60 basis points ahead of the high end of guidance. The outperformance was largely driven by increased operating revenue from wet slips and dry storage space demand and expense savings across the portfolio. Our UK portfolio performed well and we are experiencing continued strong demand for holiday homes. Additionally, Park Holidays has proactively locked in utility costs through 2024, which will benefit our residents. The integration of our UK operations continues to advance smoothly and we'll continue to realize synergies between our team systems, technologies and methodologies over time. Development and expansion activity remains an important contributor to our long-term growth. We continue to entitle land and locations with high structural demand in order to maintain a robust pipeline of future embedded growth. Accordingly, in the quarter and through the date of this call, we purchased four fully entitled manufactured housing land parcels for a total of $20 million that provide an opportunity to develop approximately 800 additional sites. During the quarter, Sun sold 724 new and pre-owned homes in our communities. New home sales prices average $183,000 for the quarter up $31,000 from the prior year. This 21% increase in the past year reflects the high quality and demand to live in a Sun community. The demand to live in a Sun community is also evident as total portfolio Manufactured Housing and RV occupancy reached 97.1% as of September 30. The average rental rate increases for 2023 are expected to be between 6.2% and 6.4% across our MH portfolio, excluding the UK where we expect an average rent increase in the range is 7.2% to 7.4%. For annual RV, we expect rental rate increases of 7.7% to 7.9% and a range of 7.3% to 7.6% increases in Marina rents. As previously disclosed, Hurricane Ian caused significant flooding and wind damage at three RV properties and damage to the sea wall and docks at one Marina all located near Fort Myers, Florida. Prior to the hurricane making landfall, we acted our emergency plan. Our team members, along with third party contractors began restoration work as soon as it was safe to return on site, reorganized convoys of supplies, food and travel trailers to our Florida properties. We cannot be more proud of the entire team and effectively managing through a challenging situation. We expect that our property casualty flood and business interrupt insurance will fully cover us net of deductibles. We are grateful for and humbled by the dedication of our team members and pleased with the company's performance today. I will now turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our financial results in more detail. Fernando? Hey, Nick, it's John. Good morning. Hope you're well. The answer to that is no. On the new home side, primarily what we saw was timing associated with the hurricane, which actually happened on the 28 of September. So it's just as we were closing out the third quarter and it pushed out anticipated closings that we had lined up in Florida for the – into the fourth quarter. So we're seeing those closed. It also had an impact on the margin since some of those higher margin sales are associated with those sales, so we expect to pick those back up in the fourth quarter. On the pre-owned side, really it has to do with – fewer residents who want to sell their homes, which gives us less inventory to resell that tracks the same with fewer broker transaction. I think it really speaks again, to the best in class quality of our communities. The lifestyles that our residents have and they're holding onto their homes is staying longer even as home values continue to increase. So no indicator whatsoever. Just a little bit of timing. $183,000, which is industry leading home prices. Well, I can tell you Nick that through the first nine months of the year Park Holidays year-over-year growth and home sales is 13%, so very strong demand continues. Sure. Thanks, Michael. So the primary driver for the lower operating expense growth would be on payroll, and that would be due to two factors. One is the roll-off of the increase that we put in place in July of 2021, which rolled off at the end of the second quarter. So a more moderate growth from that perspective from that onetime increase. And then in the third quarter, we did put in place some cost containment strategies on the payroll side and on the utility side across MH, RV and Marina. On a year-to-date basis, our expense growth for MH, RV is now at 6.3% and the same percentage for the Marina side. So certainly not expecting, say, 1% growth on a year-over-year basis moving forward, but did put in place some strategies to combat say inflationary pressures that we were seeing at the portfolio. The only other thing I'd add, Wes, this is John. In most cases, our portfolio utility costs are passed on. Our residents, frankly, are in the same boat as any one single family, but frankly, they have an advantage because our homes are typically smaller and cost less from a utility perspective. So, I think that, that's an important point to bring up as well as on transient side of business, we capture those increases in the formal rates that we charge for those sites. Actually, John, don't have that figure right in front of me. We can follow back up to you on that. Apologize. The same – call it the same store figure for home sale revenue was up around 13% for the third quarter. Yes, John, I view – this is John. I view it as a one-time item. We don't deal with events of this magnitude very often. And the last time we dealt with the storm of this magnitude was five years ago. Before that probably a decade or more, I mean, Ian was the first one I dealt with [indiscernible]. Yes. Hey, Samir, it's John. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Here's how we think about it. We view rent increases like a marathon versus a sprint. I think that I probably shared this Gary a lot of times, but the most expensive site we have in our portfolio is a vacant one. And I think that our strategy has stood the test of time. For over 25 years we've delivered positive revenue and NOI growth each and every year, while others have seen the ups and downs. We continue to deliver long-term cash flow stability. We maintain a solid relationship with our resident base, which is also our sales force that brings us an industry leading occupancy growth that we've had. And I will add that, at $183,000 a home we command average home sale price that far exceed virtually all competitors in our asset class. I think that illustrates the unmatched quality and value of our communities represent. So I think we view our strategy as well balanced across all of our stakeholders, including our residents who live in a well maintained community and see value creation in their homes. And the bottom line is we have the ability to match our expense increases at over 90% of our MH sites. But for the reasons I just share is why we're comfortable with the range where we're at for 2023. I think what we're seeing with a midpoint of 7.3% is higher. I mean they typically have been in the 5s. So it's markedly higher than it was last year historically. The second part of the question, Brad? I think, once again, I'd say what I shared a little bit earlier that I think that with what's going on in the UK and the difficulty to go other places and the devaluation of the pound, I think that frankly, that drives more domestic vacationing. And it drives, as we're seeing with the home sales growth that they've produced over the course of 2022, considerable demand even over last year, which was a pretty record year for them as well as in terms of home sales. I think bookings for Q4 or maybe pacing, and Fernando shared this in guidance, facing slightly below the range last year, but pretty close to tracking the same. We'll provide guidance in terms of what our forward bookings look like into first quarter and second quarter when we release earnings next time around. Uptick, Josh, would be that deal costs are recognized in G&A. So that would be the primary driver in the sequential quarter-over-quarter increase. That's correct. I think – so for this year, Anthony, it's John. Thanks for the question. This year, we've already completed roughly 700 sites of expansion development in the UK. And I think previously we stated that we expect to stay in that range. Obviously, we'll match that up with demand as we go. I think I have to circle back with you in terms of the economics associated with the – returns associated with those sites, which we would be happy to do. I think we'd see that those sites to get leased up, along with other vacant sites, they have in the portfolio over the course of a given year that they've developed over the year."

Having said that, I would like to introduce management with us today. Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John McLaren, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Fernando Castro-Caratini, Chief Financial Officer. After their remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our second quarter 2022 results and provide an update on our full year guidance. We are pleased to share that our portfolio has continued to deliver strong performance, as we fill the ongoing demand for attainable housing and affordable outdoor vacationing options. Highly recurring and dependable revenues across our portfolio are evident in the strong results we have consistently delivered throughout all economic cycles. The combination of these drivers led to Sun achieving core FFO of $2.02 per diluted share in the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, core FFO per diluted share was $2.04, which represents a 13% increase from the prior year. We continue to experience high demand for our Manufactured Housing communities and RV resorts. In the second quarter, we grew our revenue producing sites by 950, representing record quarterly growth. Over 85% of this increase came from converting transient RV customers at annual leases. We are pleased that when transient RV guests discover the experience and value proposition of an RV vacation at a Sun outdoors resort, they choose to make it a longer-term vacationing option. The first half of 2022, we have converted over 1,400 transient guests to annual leases, which is about three quarters of the record number of conversions achieved during all of 2021. Our proactive approach to converting transient guests longer-term annual residents has been a consistent strategy that as we build Sun's portfolios through selectively acquiring best-in-class resorts, has resulted in even greater revenue stickiness and higher NOI per site. Our same-property Manufactured Housing and RV portfolio demonstrates continued solid gains. In the second quarter Manufactured Housing and RV same property NOI grew 3.6% over 2021, driven by a 4.8% revenue increase offset by a 7.3% expense increase. Within our Marina segment, same property NOI grew 7.1% for the quarter, driven by a 6.1% increase in revenues from slip storage income, offset by a 3.4% increase in expenses. Looking forward to the next several quarters, the current operating environment of high inflation and economic uncertainty presents challenges for all businesses. After nearly 40 years in the business, I personally have seen and experienced the cycle tested nature of the demand for attainable housing and affordable vacationing, which when combined with our best-in-class assets, produces steady cash flow growth and reliable bottom line performance. We have a decade's long track record of growing our business and cash flows with operating, acquiring and expanding Manufactured Housing communities, dating back to 1975 and RV communities dating back to 1996. Specific to RV, I would highlight that we have three competitive advantages and continuing to garner transient RV revenues. Namely, our proprietary reservation technology including Campspot, the quality and locations of our resorts and an unmatched team that provide a best in the industry customer experience. Among our Manufactured Housing and RV properties, also important to note that in over 90% of our Manufactured Housing portfolio, we were able to increase annual rents by CPI or greater. As a result, we can pass through rent increases annually to mitigate the impact of inflation. In the Marina portfolio, we expect our locations to perform well during uncertain economic times, given the higher average household incomes of our members to continuous and growing need for both storage and the compelling fundamentals and the demand side for marinas is an existing base of approximately 12 million registered, both within the U.S., supply of only 900,000 to 1 million wet slips. Additionally, the overall supply of marinas continues to decline, as developers acquire and repurpose them into waterfront, residential and other commercial uses. As of June 30, our Safe Harbor Marinas, represent a network of 130 marinas that provide the highest quality, essential wet slip and dry storage facilities, members required. In turn, this generates recurring revenue as the average Safe Harbor Marina member stays for approximately seven years to eight years. The common fundamentals among Manufactured Housing, RV and marinas are the scarcity locations, demand that far outpaces supply and the absolute barriers to entry. This leads to resiliency of our revenues across our portfolio as evidenced by our strong performance to date. We also achieved strong external growth during the second quarter and through the date of this call, we closed on $1.8 billion of assets, consisting of four Manufactured Housing communities, three marinas and 52 holiday parks, including the 40 property Park Holiday's portfolio in the UK. The remainder of the year, Sun's focus will be on integrating these assets into our portfolio and recognizing the accretive value of these acquisitions of being highly selective in pursuing additional opportunities. Our development platform continues to be a compelling growth driver and a unique differentiator for Sun. During the second quarter, we acquired two newly developed Manufactured Housing properties in Arizona and Texas. Combined, they include nearly 450 fully developed sites ready for occupancy with an additional 600 expansion sites to be completed in the future. These developments give Sun the added attainable housing presence in highly attractive locations. High quality Manufactured Home in a Sun community is a very desirable way for people to achieve their dream of owning a home. Turning to our UK portfolio, the opportunities are very similar to the Sun Manufactured Housing business, including stickiness of revenues, attractive growth through expansions and developments and similar supply and demand dynamics. The combination of the Park Holidays and the Park Leisure portfolios, we have a highly desirable footprint with 75% of our target customers within a 90-mile drive, one of our communities. The Park Holiday's portfolio has an expansion pipeline of over 1,500 sites, in addition to approximately 700 newly developed and completed sites. Over the past 15 years, the Park Holidays team has shown their ability to create value for their stakeholders. Last and certainly not least, we released our latest ESG report during the quarter that highlights the significant progress we made in 2021. We increased our performance data and began laying the foundation for establishing improvement targets for key ESG measures. We are especially pleased and in its recently released ESG report, NAREIT recognized back-to-school program, which offers free tutoring for dependents of Sun team members. Sun is very well positioned to continue to create value through organic growth, expansions, new developments and select acquisitions. We are grateful for the entire team's ongoing dedications throughout integrations and look forward to building upon the deep operating experiences and strength of the team members to continue delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to John and Fernando to speak to our results in detail. John?\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. Our second quarter and year-to-date performance in 2022 reflects the consistently strong operational results and contributions throughout the entire portfolio. Our same-property MH and RV NOI increased 3.6% for the quarter, driven by a 4.8% increase in revenues and offset by a 7.3% increase in property operating expenses. Our MH communities performed well with a 4.4% increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2021. Our annual RV revenue increased 12.1% driven by the high volume of transient annual conversions, which contributed revenue uplift on site in the range of 40% to 60% in the first year. For the three months ended June 30, same-property transient RV revenue increased 60 basis points even as we had 1,500 fewer sites due to our success of conversions to annuals. Weighted average rental rate increase was 4.5% for the quarter and occupancy increased by 170 basis points. Marina same-property NOI increased by 7.1% for the second quarter and 5% for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Our boat slip storage annual revenue increased 7.1% for the quarter compared to the same time last year, reflecting the positive supply and demand dynamics that Gary spoke to you earlier. We acquired two Manufactured Housing developments this quarter. Spanish Trails, an age-restricted community located in Casa Grande, Arizona and Pine Acre Trails an all-age community in Conroe, Texas. These two newly developed locations provide Sun with an immediate opportunity to supply our quality, value-oriented solutions to municipalities in need of attainable housing. Within the quarter, Sun sold over 975 new and pre-owned homes in our communities. The average new home selling price increased 7.2% for the three months ended June 30 to $164,000 with the margin approaching 20%. Additionally, in our brokered home sales, we are pleased to report a 37% increase in sales prices year-over-year demonstrating the enduring value of living in a Sun Communities. Our MH and RV total portfolio occupancy reached 97.2% as of June 30. Year-to-date, we have received approximately 29,000 applications to live in a Sun Community as demand for our communities remains robust. As Sun continues to execute on development expansion deliveries during and subsequent to quarter end, we purchased three land parcels for $10.7 million located in Colorado, Utah, and Nevada. These three entitled land parcels will provide Sun with future opportunities for greenfield development and expansion of over 650 sites in areas of high demand and needed supply. On our last call, we discussed commencing construction on five Manufactured Housing project located in Colorado, Florida, Texas and California. Construction is advancing as anticipated and we expect to have two communities open their first phases by the end of this year. Forward bookings for the total RV portfolio owned and operated by Sun are slightly ahead of last year's record pace, although, they have moderated compared to our prior expectations. Continued growth is supported by an additional base of new customers who experienced an RV vacation for the first time last year. Similar to our strong performance over the Memorial Day weekend, during 4th of July holiday, same-property transient revenue increased by 9.4% compared to 2021 and was driven by a 17.3% increase in average daily rates. We are pleased with our continued performance and are grateful for our team members who continue to go the extra mile each day. I will now turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our financial results in more detail. Fernando?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, John. For the second quarter, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share on a constant currency basis of $2.04, which is 13% above the prior year and exceeded the high end of our quarterly guidance range by $0.03. The outperformance was driven by better than forecasted results from the total Marina portfolio and home sales contribution given increased sales price and margin for the quarter. These positive variances at the property level offset higher real estate taxes, interest expense and lower than expected transient RV revenues. As of June 30, Sun had $6.9 billion of debt outstanding, equating to a net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio of 6.3 times. Our total debt carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and has a weighted average maturity of 7.9 years. Excluding our bank revolving credit and term loan facilities, the remaining $5.2 billion of debt has a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and weighted average maturity of 9.6 years. During and subsequent to quarter end, we settled forward agreements on approximately 6.2 million shares that netted $1.1 billion of proceeds, used to pay down borrowings on our credit facility. We had previously disclosed approximately 5.2 million shares settled in connection with the Park Holidays acquisition in early April. The remaining 1 million shares were settled to fund additional acquisition activity. Additionally, earlier this month, we swapped GBP400 million of our funded GBP875 million term loan from variable rate to a fixed interest rate of 3.67% through 2025. Pro forma for the $1.8 billion of acquisitions and capital markets activity completed during and subsequent to the quarter, our net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio is inside our stated target range of 5.5 times. We have also reduced our variable rate debt exposure to 16% today as part of our active capital management strategy. Due to the addition of our manufactured housing portfolio in the UK, we will now provide an guide to core FFO on a constant currency basis. Like other REITs with non-U.S. dollar currency exposure, our constant currency adjustments eliminate the non-cash fluctuations and reporting that are due to foreign currency exchange rate movements relative to the U.S. dollar, thereby enabling investors to compare fundamental performance across time periods. We continue to see strong year-over-year growth across the platform after a great 2021 for Sun. As summarized in the press release issued yesterday, we are increasing the low end of full year guidance for constant currency FFO per share by $0.02 to a revised range of $7.22 to $7.32 per share. The $7.27 midpoint of our new range is $0.01 higher than last quarter and represents 11.7% growth over 2021 results. We are establishing third quarter 2022 constant currency core FFO per share guidance in the range of $2.56 to $2.61. At the same-property level, we are moderating our growth expectations slightly for Manufactured Housing and RV by 50 basis points to 6.4% at the midpoint of a 6% to 6.8% range. The modestly lower growth accounts for higher real estate tax assessments in Texas, one of our larger MH markets and current transient RV revenue expectations for the remainder of the year. Third quarter same-property MH and RV NOI growth is expected to be 6.8% at the midpoint of guidance. For Marina same-property, we are slightly adjusting the NOI growth range for the year by 30 basis points to 6.4% at the midpoint of 6% to 6.8% range. Third quarter same-property Marina NOI growth is expected to be 8.3% at the midpoint of guidance. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and capital markets activity through July 25, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now being our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Berenberg. Please proceed with your questions.\nKeegan Carl: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first here on transient RV in the quarter, I know prior you disclosed the forward bookings were up 4% for same-property, are you guys seeing any trends that you see there, shorter length there is visibility into the booking window and then how do you think about guidance on this particular segment for the rest of the year?\nJohn McLaren: Hi, Keegan. it's John. Good morning. Yeah. Our booking window for summertime stays in our RV resorts generally is between 15 to 60 days, is when we see the majority of our bookings and sort of -- it ticked up from day 60 to their stay to the 15th day, which is sort of the peak, when people come in and haven't seen a tremendous -- when a chart that out in comparison in terms of like, when bookings fall in haven't seen a whole lot difference between that in prior years.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: And then Keegan to complement the second part of your question, as far as our expectations for the full year on RV transient revenue growth, we had previously stated a range of 12% at the midpoint, those expectations for the full year now are at about 6.4% with a third quarter growth on the transient side of about 4%.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Very helpful there. And then maybe just one more on Marina. I know I got its guidance as well, just maybe a little bit more color here, obviously, there is a 30 basis point cut, is it more expenses or demand deteriorations, any more color there would be helpful?\nGary Shiffman: Hi, Keegan. It's Gary. I think that what we're seeing is just a great performance overall demand and rate continues to be exactly as we underwrote it. Guidance is slightly adjusted for some longer stays that resulted from more of the restricted COVID travel by the big boats. So as things opened up a little bit, the boats, as they normally do travel, started traveling a little bit more. So the modest adjustment that's in there is our standpoint as a result of that.\nKeegan Carl: Great. Thanks for the time guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nWesley Golladay: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Want to go back to the pace for the third quarter for RV. I think you said it's going to be 4% in the third quarter, I just wanted to see what you're seeing on the ground. Are you seeing fewer visits, shorter stays or you're just converting too much -- too many sites to annual?\nJohn McLaren: Yeah, Wes. Good morning. It's John. I think the way I'd answer that is that 2021 represents a year in our view where we enjoyed growth that was beyond anything we'd seen historically. And as we shared before recorded, record new guests sort of set the stage. To answer your question, the fact is, we're still enjoying those tailwinds and our overall RV performance thus far in 2022. Just few points of reference, since, the start of 2021, we've converted over 10% of our transient sites and annual leases, which again as I said in my remarks, there was a 40% to 60% revenue pickup in the year that they convert. Of that Mr. Gary shared in the first half of 2022, we saw continued growth converting over 1,400 sites, which is over 75% ahead of our record-setting first year -- full year of thousand 2021 conversion results. So even with a 10% reduction transient set for the last 18 months, we still grew transient in RV revenue overall in the second quarter and outlook by Fernando said 4% in the third quarter having really great Memorial Day and 4th July holidays, as well as the expectation that we would grow approximately 6% -- I think Fernando said 6.4%. I think the key there for the full year -- I think the key there, that number is actually slightly elevated against typical transient growth numbers that we have realized annually pre-COVID, but now with more conversion success and also in the face of 9% inflation, that we have today. So I think the transient is performing extremely well, it remains steady. And I think we continue to as we shared before build growth on a new base of customers we established last year.\nWesley Golladay: Got it. And I want to go back to that comment about 12 million boaters and supply of 1 million slips. Do you have insight in the pent-up demand to become a member for -- the Safe Harbor platform and is there any markets that really stand out where there is a really big backlog?\nGary Shiffman: I think all Markets stand out, the fact of the matter is that occupancy remains very, very high, because demand as I said is far greater than the wet slips that are available today. But if you want to follow up on anything specific related to anything, please reach out to Fernando, Stephanie Sera (ph) of the company we can get you specific details with regard to individual demand and occupancy. For most marinas during the high season, we have more demand than we can actually supply and they are at full occupancy and for those on the tour, there is examples of where occupancy is even above 100% where full time marina members move out and we can temporarily rent their sites with their permission. Again, well occupancy and any adjustment to guidance just really related to a little bit of the easing of COVID travel on the larger boats.\nWesley Golladay: Great. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Michael. Maybe starting on Park Holidays. I recognize it's only been a handful of months, but you provided guidance for the third quarter and then this six months for the back half of this year, and I recognize that also includes some of the acquisitions, subsequent to the initial company acquisition. So I was wondering how the -- at least the initial properties acquired have performed relative to underwriting thus far?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. I'll start out and anyone can jump in. But we are certainly equal to or slightly exceeding. All of our underwriting performance remains very, very robust in the UK. The addition of the Park Leisure portfolio as I mentioned in our comments gives us an incredible footprint with really targeted resident within a 90-mile drive evolve coastal and inland properties. So the expectation is -- as we look out over the next 12 months will continue to integrate all of the acquisitions into work holidays operating system and we would expect continued growth to equal or exceed our underwriting. So very, very positive, what we're seeing there.\nJohn McLaren: Nick, this is John. I'll just add on to that with the Park Leisure acquisition, those 11 properties really fits the sweet spot and the fact that those sites in those properties are 92% owner occupied. That was 400 expansion sites in front of it as well, so it's a really solid acquisition that we're excited about.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then I guess just more broadly on the acquisition pipeline, how is it looking today and are you seeing any changes to cap rates across the different asset classes that you invest in? \nGary Shiffman: So, Nick, it's Gary. We continue to see opportunities across all three platforms. We do remain very disciplined with regard to our view on capital allocation. Generally, MH and RV remain in the 4 to 5 cap rate range with the highest quality Manufactured Housing still seeing transactions in the 3 cap rate range. Marinas remain in the 6 to 8 range for the quality that Safe Harbor and Sun are looking for. On the UK side yields for everything we've done tax adjusted, they've been in the low to mid-7s. We haven't seen a lot of change as far as our outlook goes. We would expect the challenging financial markets and conditions out there could yield some very special opportunities and we'd like to think that we'd be in a position and prepared to take advantage of those opportunities as they move forward. So we'll continue to watch, but very disciplined look as to how we're thinking about external acquisitions at this time.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. Are any of those opportunities presenting themselves now or is that more of maybe potential future expectations?\nGary Shiffman: I think it's more of a future expectation, there are couple of platforms in Australia that I never would have thought would have come to market that are coming to market right now with some of the bankers. And we are not involved in those processes at this time, but it's interesting to note that they came to market before I ever thought they would have.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrad Heffern: Yeah. Thanks. Looking at the Park Holiday's NOI split this quarter, about 65% of it was from home sales. Can you reconcile how that compares to the 37% of gross profit that you quoted with the deal? And maybe just walk through how the split changes quarter-by-quarter with seasonality?\nJohn McLaren: Brad, the expectation at the touring season -- the heavy touring season for the Park Holiday's portfolio is during the third quarter and so there is an increased percentage of NOI contribution from real property during the third quarter. We can step through those percentages on a follow-up call. I don't have those figures in front of me.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then on the currency exposure, is there a plan to hedge that in some way or maybe pursue a pound offering in order to neutralize some of that?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: That's a great question. We -- to remind everyone, we are fully naturally hedged in the UK, where we paid for the transaction with borrowings on our multi-currency credit facility that includes Sterling. So any cash flow that is generated by the UK operations pays down any debt that's outstanding. We are not moving dollars back and forth to the U.S. So there is no realized gain or loss from translation. In time, if we would plan to be moving capital from the UK back into the U.S., we would look to put in cash flow hedges at that moment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on the impact of inflation per site growth in 2022 with elevated historically, but not necessarily at the level of inflation. When you said 2023 rent inflation levels will likely be higher than last year. There has been inflationary times in the past, can you help us think about how much you're able to pass along during elevated inflationary times? And just related to that, there has also been elevated expenses and your revenue isn't growing as fast of your expenses this year, so as we look forward, do you think that revenue can grow faster than expenses?\nGary Shiffman: Well, thanks Michael for pointing out that I'm the oldest person in the room. So when we look at history, I'm going to end up here. Let's start with the latter or move to the former. I think we've shared with the market that about 40% to 50% of our rental increases in Manufactured Housing had to be noticed 90 days in advance of January 1, mostly in the Florida properties. But when we looked in August and September at our budgeting as we're doing right now, at that time, we didn't have that crystal ball to ever imagine inflation coming to this 9.1%. It was most recently reported in. So we sat rental increases, I think roughly 4.2% for the year in MH and we have to live with those until the next rental increases are put in, which were beginning to budget right now. And to the beginning of your question in my long history of 40 plus years in Manufactured Housing and through recessionary periods and certainly through the GFC, we are able to pass through all inflationary expenses in the form of annual rental increases in our current portfolio, CPI or greater in 90% of our Manufactured Housing communities. So we feel very comfortable that with the insight of where inflation is going in the benefits that we'll have over the next 60 days to watch it, we will be able to adjust our rental increases to match our expenses related to our cost. So this coming year 2023, we should see equal to or greater increase, okay, on our average rentals.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's really helpful. Thanks a lot Gary. And then on the topic of G&A, the increases you've built the foundation to support the number of business lines. At this point, do you feel that you have the necessary infrastructure in place to support the growth of your three, four segments going forward? So said in other way, should SG&A growth moderate in the years ahead?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. It's a great question and it really ties into the rate question that we just spoke about. When we look at 2023, we recognize and hope our stakeholders do as well that we've established a tremendous platform. It will allow us to grow and create value in all the ways that we continue to share with the market the internal opportunities of growth and external. When we couple that with both historical performance and our ability to pass on inflationary costs in the form of rent, along with the G&A that really has grown substantially over the last three or four years, we would expect to be able to leverage that G&A. And as we look out forward, really our goal and budgeting is to be flat year-over-year G&A. So that coupled with the rental rate increases, the pass through inflation allow us to be very comfortable of how we're thinking lot of results going into 2023. So, scalability of G&A, I think is really at the forefront of what the company can deliver going forward.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you for that. Good luck in the second half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSamir Khanal: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Hey, Gary, just in that last point about G&A, you said sort of flat -- keeping that flat next year, you're talking sort of on an absolute level or you're saying kind of in the G&A as a percent of revenue?\nGary Shiffman: We're going to get as close as we can on an absolute basis, but I was talking about percent of revenue. But we're really targeting, as I said, leveraging everything, we've invested. You bring the Marina platform into public reporting position and same is true with the work being done on the UK. And as we also continue to reduce the transient sites from transient to annual at the pace we're going right now, we would expect there would be some G&A savings there as well.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. Got it. And then Fernando, I guess this is more of a modeling question, but -- and you talked about conversions as well for transient to annual, and then that really picked up in the quarter. I guess how should we think about that pace of conversion sort of into back half of this year and into next year at this point?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: As we look at our current inventory of about 28,600, 28,700 sites of transient RV sites, we would say that is a good 25% of those sites that are candidates for conversion over time. We have seen elevated conversions over the course of 2021 and certainly 2022, where we're already at 75% of last year's record figures and could expect ending 2022 with a higher conversion amount, but we still have a good runway for a number of years. And as we continue to expand our communities that does provide additional inventory for conversion over time\nSamir Khanal: Okay. Got it. That's it from me. Thanks guys.\nGary Shiffman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Hi everyone. I had a -- I just -- I saw you had a comment in Page 10 of your press release, where you mentioned you reclassified certain revenues and expenses on the Marina side. Just curious on kind of more color and what exactly was changing there?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure, Josh. Thank you for the question. We've primarily reclassified certain expenses mainly utilities, payroll and credit card fees to most closely aligned with the revenue drivers for those expenses. This reclassification did not have any impact unexpected growth.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. So it's overall, were they just not in that same-store number before, is that...\nFernando Castro-Caratini: There was a reclassification between real property, real property revenues and expenses and service, retail, dining and entertainment revenues and expenses.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Maybe I'll follow up offline because I had one other question. So one of the -- one of the hot topics, I've been fielding from investors is that, you've added two new business segments Marinas and Park Holidays and there's not really that much publicly available data to see how they performed in recession. Can you maybe walk us through how you're thinking about the cyclicality of these business lines?\nGary Shiffman: I think for those of you on the investor tour recently in the UK. When we think about the UK Park Holidays business, it aligns right up with our Manufactured Housing business in particular our snowbirds. They are second homes, vacation homes for a qualified buyer that must own a single-family residential home. We have the 15-year period that current management -- a lot of current management has worked in building the portfolio and they've seen a very, very solid growth over the 15-year period of time including the GFC, where they also grew right through that period of time. So we're thinking it pretty much in terms of how we would think of our Manufactured Housing portfolio, which we talked about being very resilient in tough economic times as a affordable housing and affordable vacationing. So the best comparative data we have is the performance over the last 15 years, their portfolio as compared to how MH has performed really for the last 30 plus years as a public company and 10 as a private company that I've been involved in it. So to date, we're continuing to see that perform right to budget or as I said, slightly ahead of it. Additionally, with regard to marinas, we don't have same-property set to look at. We have the performance that we're starting to develop in the KPIs that we are going continue sharing with everybody. But our fundamental belief is that, it is a business that matches up to funds platform just because of the demand far outstripping supply factors that boats have been getting larger and larger. So it's not an option anymore like it used to be to trailer them into your backyard or your garage or something like that, especially with homeowners associations not permitting long-term stays. And I think I mentioned in my remarks, that we actually do have a diminishing amount of marinas across the U.S. as we do see the real estate development take place on a very priced waterfront areas. So we would expect that marinas will continue to perform very, very resilient in this market. Boat owners love their boats and boating and there is a shortage of places to put them on the water. So we're expecting a resilient performance moving forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Hey. Thanks for the time. Fernando, a question on the cost structure of the MH business. So you did MHs are up about 8.5%, they were up 8% last year. If a high inflation environment continues, is high single-digit expense growth for the MH portfolio a reasonable betting line?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Well, thank you for the question, John, I would say there are a number of items that would moderate the expected growth over the course of the second half of the year. The main contributor to that would be an easier comp in the second half of 2022 for payroll as we've shared with the market. And during July of 2021, we had increased the Sun minimum wage for all team members at the property level, and that led to much higher expense growth over the course of the last 12 months. That comp now rolls off and it's a more moderated growth in that step function increase. The moderating that would be as shared in my remarks, we did receive real estate tax assessment in Texas that was higher than our expectations. As normal course of business, we can test that assessment and then to the extent that we are successful, we then reduce that tax hit. But would expect that expense growth for the MH portfolio to be lower than what you've seen over the course of the first half of the year.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then a question on marina revenue between transient and non-transient. So I know transient is small, two-line items going into different directions in the quarter, excluding transient up 7.5% transient revenue is down 9.5%. So can you just understand, kind of the building behavior and the customer behavior around the docs, right? And why transient is declining, while other revenues are still increasing by a pretty big clip?\nJohn McLaren: I think, John, I would suggest some of that is the movement that's taking place with a bigger boats that have been occupying a lot of sites through COVID, as they haven't moved around and some of that is just being picked up as they move up by the transient. So you're seeing that because there is not a lot of percentage of sites -- slips available for transient, when the season started. And so it's a little bit of movement, we were able to slip in a little bit more transient growth.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: And John, you mentioned, right, it's a, a very small number. It was -- you're talking about $4 million in the -- over the course of the quarter. So, the comparative growth number is larger, but we're talking about a small dollar amount.\nJohn Pawlowski: Understood. Gary are you seeing any extensive activity flow through the marinas right now? Outside of that movement in the large ships from COVID issues?\nGary Shiffman: We are not, John. I know that visiting some of the marinas recently, everybody is out there enjoying their boats, but it has obviously been putting up with a lot of hot weather. And we do not see any trends that would be different than the ordinary with regard to rental of slips. There is more demand than we can actually pick and the long-term membership.\nJohn Pawlowski: All right. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi. Good morning. Question on the Gurney's deal, you did in July in Montauk. It's a pretty sizable deal. Just wanted to differ a bit, if that does include the resort portion? And if you would consider maybe selling that to a hospitality owners, if that makes sense and maybe some more details around that will be great?\nGary Shiffman: Sure. Safe Harbor had been working with a seller for many, many years on a relationship basis trying to acquire this Island Marina, which came with the resort, the marina. And so location is just an irreplaceable asset located in Montauk, which is really a high demand area for the over 10,000 existing regional Safe Harbor members to utilize. So it was acquired with the hotel same seller, so both were what was sold to Safe Harbor. And obviously the membership has already begun taking advantage of both the resort and the slips that are there. They're really pleased with Sun's strength and a history of buying on an accretive basis and recognizing the long-term value creation opportunity achieved by growing yield and cap rates on an annual basis, which we'll do in the marina. And the resort is being operated by a third party, which is actually the sellers of Gurney Resort Management company. And we will definitely be looking at our options for opportunities with regard to that resort as we move forward.\nAnthony Powell: Thanks. And then maybe one more on, I guess, the Texas Pine Acre Trails MH deal, that's -- I haven't seen a ton of MH deals in U.S. in a while. So you've seen a few here this quarter. Curious how that was underwritten given the development site you have there and how the interest was for that deal compared to some of the age-restricted deals you've done elsewhere?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: I can speak to the interest and sort of how it came about. So I think I've shared before, we've spent the last six years really building the pipeline of sites. No pun intended, the road in front of us in terms of MH development. Today, we have about 30,000 sites in various stages of entitlement that are in our pipeline and as Gary said a number of times, I think that's a unique advantage that we have. As a part of that in the markets that we look at, we talk to a lot of people as we -- it takes a lot to get them into the pipeline and we came across these resellers who were already starting to -- they're already entitled to site and started developing that site and so we took over midway through. And when we look at it fits the profile -- the investment profile of all of our development that we do, which we would expect that this is going to kick off a high single-digit IRR and in an area that has -- I will say a little bit elevated lease-up associated like we see in Texas. So it was obviously a very attractive development acquisition that we're excited about, especially the fact that we've got 400 plus sites that we could fill up rapid succession.\nAnthony Powell: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I had a question on your UK getting into the second half of the year of a little bit over $81 million NOI. Where will that trend lead to on an EBITDA basis?\nJohn McLaren: John, we provided guidance during the -- right after the first quarter of G&A for the Park Holidays platform at a midpoint of about $27 million for the -- from April to December on a -- on a non-constant currency basis, that figure would be expected to be a little bit less, call it $1 million or $2 less than $27 million.\nJohn Kim: Okay. I just wanted to know if there was any additional G&A through recent acquisitions or other deductions from NOI to EBITDA?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: In there small, yeah. Small figure.\nJohn Kim: My second question is post quarter, you raised equity on a forward basis at a little bit over $172 per share. I was wondering, how you were able to accomplish that given the share price wasn't at those levels?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sorry, I didn't hear the end of it, John, about kind of final question was…\nJohn Kim: Your share price didn’t -- you've raised above your share price effectively.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Yeah. I think that was just the timing of what was available in the market and we were just match funding to some of the acquisition activity that was going out there.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Hau with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Hau: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Fernando, going back to the UK guidance, last quarter, the guidance only included Park Holiday and an implied roughly around $125 million of NOI, if you back out G&A from EBITDA. The current guidance includes Park Leisure as well and implies $125 million of NOI after adjusting for FX. It seems to me that you guys have a lower guidance even on a constant currency basis, am I missing something here?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Anthony, you're not. As you saw, we provided an update this morning, where we updated our expectations for this remaining six months of the year inclusive of Park Leisure and other acquisitions in the UK. That contribution at a midpoint would be -- for the next six months would be bringing in about $102.5 million to which you would add the $40.5 million that we've already realized over the course of the second quarter of the year, bringing NOI contribution to around $140 million.\nAnthony Hau: Got you. And the recent heat wave in UK make any impact to the Holiday Parks at all?\nJohn McLaren: No, it didn't. This is John. I talk to those guys every day.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nGary Shiffman: Thank you everybody and we look forward to speaking again on next quarter's results and feel free to follow up with any of your questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our second quarter 2022 results and provide an update on our full year guidance. We are pleased to share that our portfolio has continued to deliver strong performance, as we fill the ongoing demand for attainable housing and affordable outdoor vacationing options. Highly recurring and dependable revenues across our portfolio are evident in the strong results we have consistently delivered throughout all economic cycles. The combination of these drivers led to Sun achieving core FFO of $2.02 per diluted share in the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, core FFO per diluted share was $2.04, which represents a 13% increase from the prior year. We continue to experience high demand for our Manufactured Housing communities and RV resorts. In the second quarter, we grew our revenue producing sites by 950, representing record quarterly growth. Over 85% of this increase came from converting transient RV customers at annual leases. We are pleased that when transient RV guests discover the experience and value proposition of an RV vacation at a Sun outdoors resort, they choose to make it a longer-term vacationing option. The first half of 2022, we have converted over 1,400 transient guests to annual leases, which is about three quarters of the record number of conversions achieved during all of 2021. Our proactive approach to converting transient guests longer-term annual residents has been a consistent strategy that as we build Sun's portfolios through selectively acquiring best-in-class resorts, has resulted in even greater revenue stickiness and higher NOI per site. Our same-property Manufactured Housing and RV portfolio demonstrates continued solid gains. In the second quarter Manufactured Housing and RV same property NOI grew 3.6% over 2021, driven by a 4.8% revenue increase offset by a 7.3% expense increase. Within our Marina segment, same property NOI grew 7.1% for the quarter, driven by a 6.1% increase in revenues from slip storage income, offset by a 3.4% increase in expenses. Looking forward to the next several quarters, the current operating environment of high inflation and economic uncertainty presents challenges for all businesses. After nearly 40 years in the business, I personally have seen and experienced the cycle tested nature of the demand for attainable housing and affordable vacationing, which when combined with our best-in-class assets, produces steady cash flow growth and reliable bottom line performance. We have a decade's long track record of growing our business and cash flows with operating, acquiring and expanding Manufactured Housing communities, dating back to 1975 and RV communities dating back to 1996. Specific to RV, I would highlight that we have three competitive advantages and continuing to garner transient RV revenues. Namely, our proprietary reservation technology including Campspot, the quality and locations of our resorts and an unmatched team that provide a best in the industry customer experience. Among our Manufactured Housing and RV properties, also important to note that in over 90% of our Manufactured Housing portfolio, we were able to increase annual rents by CPI or greater. As a result, we can pass through rent increases annually to mitigate the impact of inflation. In the Marina portfolio, we expect our locations to perform well during uncertain economic times, given the higher average household incomes of our members to continuous and growing need for both storage and the compelling fundamentals and the demand side for marinas is an existing base of approximately 12 million registered, both within the U.S., supply of only 900,000 to 1 million wet slips. Additionally, the overall supply of marinas continues to decline, as developers acquire and repurpose them into waterfront, residential and other commercial uses. As of June 30, our Safe Harbor Marinas, represent a network of 130 marinas that provide the highest quality, essential wet slip and dry storage facilities, members required. In turn, this generates recurring revenue as the average Safe Harbor Marina member stays for approximately seven years to eight years. The common fundamentals among Manufactured Housing, RV and marinas are the scarcity locations, demand that far outpaces supply and the absolute barriers to entry. This leads to resiliency of our revenues across our portfolio as evidenced by our strong performance to date. We also achieved strong external growth during the second quarter and through the date of this call, we closed on $1.8 billion of assets, consisting of four Manufactured Housing communities, three marinas and 52 holiday parks, including the 40 property Park Holiday's portfolio in the UK. The remainder of the year, Sun's focus will be on integrating these assets into our portfolio and recognizing the accretive value of these acquisitions of being highly selective in pursuing additional opportunities. Our development platform continues to be a compelling growth driver and a unique differentiator for Sun. During the second quarter, we acquired two newly developed Manufactured Housing properties in Arizona and Texas. Combined, they include nearly 450 fully developed sites ready for occupancy with an additional 600 expansion sites to be completed in the future. These developments give Sun the added attainable housing presence in highly attractive locations. High quality Manufactured Home in a Sun community is a very desirable way for people to achieve their dream of owning a home. Turning to our UK portfolio, the opportunities are very similar to the Sun Manufactured Housing business, including stickiness of revenues, attractive growth through expansions and developments and similar supply and demand dynamics. The combination of the Park Holidays and the Park Leisure portfolios, we have a highly desirable footprint with 75% of our target customers within a 90-mile drive, one of our communities. The Park Holiday's portfolio has an expansion pipeline of over 1,500 sites, in addition to approximately 700 newly developed and completed sites. Over the past 15 years, the Park Holidays team has shown their ability to create value for their stakeholders. Last and certainly not least, we released our latest ESG report during the quarter that highlights the significant progress we made in 2021. We increased our performance data and began laying the foundation for establishing improvement targets for key ESG measures. We are especially pleased and in its recently released ESG report, NAREIT recognized back-to-school program, which offers free tutoring for dependents of Sun team members. Sun is very well positioned to continue to create value through organic growth, expansions, new developments and select acquisitions. We are grateful for the entire team's ongoing dedications throughout integrations and look forward to building upon the deep operating experiences and strength of the team members to continue delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to John and Fernando to speak to our results in detail. John? Hi, Keegan. It's Gary. I think that what we're seeing is just a great performance overall demand and rate continues to be exactly as we underwrote it. Guidance is slightly adjusted for some longer stays that resulted from more of the restricted COVID travel by the big boats. So as things opened up a little bit, the boats, as they normally do travel, started traveling a little bit more. So the modest adjustment that's in there is our standpoint as a result of that. I think all Markets stand out, the fact of the matter is that occupancy remains very, very high, because demand as I said is far greater than the wet slips that are available today. But if you want to follow up on anything specific related to anything, please reach out to Fernando, Stephanie Sera (ph) of the company we can get you specific details with regard to individual demand and occupancy. For most marinas during the high season, we have more demand than we can actually supply and they are at full occupancy and for those on the tour, there is examples of where occupancy is even above 100% where full time marina members move out and we can temporarily rent their sites with their permission. Again, well occupancy and any adjustment to guidance just really related to a little bit of the easing of COVID travel on the larger boats. Yeah. I'll start out and anyone can jump in. But we are certainly equal to or slightly exceeding. All of our underwriting performance remains very, very robust in the UK. The addition of the Park Leisure portfolio as I mentioned in our comments gives us an incredible footprint with really targeted resident within a 90-mile drive evolve coastal and inland properties. So the expectation is -- as we look out over the next 12 months will continue to integrate all of the acquisitions into work holidays operating system and we would expect continued growth to equal or exceed our underwriting. So very, very positive, what we're seeing there. So, Nick, it's Gary. We continue to see opportunities across all three platforms. We do remain very disciplined with regard to our view on capital allocation. Generally, MH and RV remain in the 4 to 5 cap rate range with the highest quality Manufactured Housing still seeing transactions in the 3 cap rate range. Marinas remain in the 6 to 8 range for the quality that Safe Harbor and Sun are looking for. On the UK side yields for everything we've done tax adjusted, they've been in the low to mid-7s. We haven't seen a lot of change as far as our outlook goes. We would expect the challenging financial markets and conditions out there could yield some very special opportunities and we'd like to think that we'd be in a position and prepared to take advantage of those opportunities as they move forward. So we'll continue to watch, but very disciplined look as to how we're thinking about external acquisitions at this time. I think it's more of a future expectation, there are couple of platforms in Australia that I never would have thought would have come to market that are coming to market right now with some of the bankers. And we are not involved in those processes at this time, but it's interesting to note that they came to market before I ever thought they would have. Well, thanks Michael for pointing out that I'm the oldest person in the room. So when we look at history, I'm going to end up here. Let's start with the latter or move to the former. I think we've shared with the market that about 40% to 50% of our rental increases in Manufactured Housing had to be noticed 90 days in advance of January 1, mostly in the Florida properties. But when we looked in August and September at our budgeting as we're doing right now, at that time, we didn't have that crystal ball to ever imagine inflation coming to this 9.1%. It was most recently reported in. So we sat rental increases, I think roughly 4.2% for the year in MH and we have to live with those until the next rental increases are put in, which were beginning to budget right now. And to the beginning of your question in my long history of 40 plus years in Manufactured Housing and through recessionary periods and certainly through the GFC, we are able to pass through all inflationary expenses in the form of annual rental increases in our current portfolio, CPI or greater in 90% of our Manufactured Housing communities. So we feel very comfortable that with the insight of where inflation is going in the benefits that we'll have over the next 60 days to watch it, we will be able to adjust our rental increases to match our expenses related to our cost. So this coming year 2023, we should see equal to or greater increase, okay, on our average rentals. Yeah. It's a great question and it really ties into the rate question that we just spoke about. When we look at 2023, we recognize and hope our stakeholders do as well that we've established a tremendous platform. It will allow us to grow and create value in all the ways that we continue to share with the market the internal opportunities of growth and external. When we couple that with both historical performance and our ability to pass on inflationary costs in the form of rent, along with the G&A that really has grown substantially over the last three or four years, we would expect to be able to leverage that G&A. And as we look out forward, really our goal and budgeting is to be flat year-over-year G&A. So that coupled with the rental rate increases, the pass through inflation allow us to be very comfortable of how we're thinking lot of results going into 2023. So, scalability of G&A, I think is really at the forefront of what the company can deliver going forward. We're going to get as close as we can on an absolute basis, but I was talking about percent of revenue. But we're really targeting, as I said, leveraging everything, we've invested. You bring the Marina platform into public reporting position and same is true with the work being done on the UK. And as we also continue to reduce the transient sites from transient to annual at the pace we're going right now, we would expect there would be some G&A savings there as well. Thanks. I think for those of you on the investor tour recently in the UK. When we think about the UK Park Holidays business, it aligns right up with our Manufactured Housing business in particular our snowbirds. They are second homes, vacation homes for a qualified buyer that must own a single-family residential home. We have the 15-year period that current management -- a lot of current management has worked in building the portfolio and they've seen a very, very solid growth over the 15-year period of time including the GFC, where they also grew right through that period of time. So we're thinking it pretty much in terms of how we would think of our Manufactured Housing portfolio, which we talked about being very resilient in tough economic times as a affordable housing and affordable vacationing. So the best comparative data we have is the performance over the last 15 years, their portfolio as compared to how MH has performed really for the last 30 plus years as a public company and 10 as a private company that I've been involved in it. So to date, we're continuing to see that perform right to budget or as I said, slightly ahead of it. Additionally, with regard to marinas, we don't have same-property set to look at. We have the performance that we're starting to develop in the KPIs that we are going continue sharing with everybody. But our fundamental belief is that, it is a business that matches up to funds platform just because of the demand far outstripping supply factors that boats have been getting larger and larger. So it's not an option anymore like it used to be to trailer them into your backyard or your garage or something like that, especially with homeowners associations not permitting long-term stays. And I think I mentioned in my remarks, that we actually do have a diminishing amount of marinas across the U.S. as we do see the real estate development take place on a very priced waterfront areas. So we would expect that marinas will continue to perform very, very resilient in this market. Boat owners love their boats and boating and there is a shortage of places to put them on the water. So we're expecting a resilient performance moving forward. We are not, John. I know that visiting some of the marinas recently, everybody is out there enjoying their boats, but it has obviously been putting up with a lot of hot weather. And we do not see any trends that would be different than the ordinary with regard to rental of slips. There is more demand than we can actually pick and the long-term membership. Sure. Safe Harbor had been working with a seller for many, many years on a relationship basis trying to acquire this Island Marina, which came with the resort, the marina. And so location is just an irreplaceable asset located in Montauk, which is really a high demand area for the over 10,000 existing regional Safe Harbor members to utilize. So it was acquired with the hotel same seller, so both were what was sold to Safe Harbor. And obviously the membership has already begun taking advantage of both the resort and the slips that are there. They're really pleased with Sun's strength and a history of buying on an accretive basis and recognizing the long-term value creation opportunity achieved by growing yield and cap rates on an annual basis, which we'll do in the marina. And the resort is being operated by a third party, which is actually the sellers of Gurney Resort Management company. And we will definitely be looking at our options for opportunities with regard to that resort as we move forward. Thank you everybody and we look forward to speaking again on next quarter's results and feel free to follow up with any of your questions. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, John. For the second quarter, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share on a constant currency basis of $2.04, which is 13% above the prior year and exceeded the high end of our quarterly guidance range by $0.03. The outperformance was driven by better than forecasted results from the total Marina portfolio and home sales contribution given increased sales price and margin for the quarter. These positive variances at the property level offset higher real estate taxes, interest expense and lower than expected transient RV revenues. As of June 30, Sun had $6.9 billion of debt outstanding, equating to a net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio of 6.3 times. Our total debt carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and has a weighted average maturity of 7.9 years. Excluding our bank revolving credit and term loan facilities, the remaining $5.2 billion of debt has a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and weighted average maturity of 9.6 years. During and subsequent to quarter end, we settled forward agreements on approximately 6.2 million shares that netted $1.1 billion of proceeds, used to pay down borrowings on our credit facility. We had previously disclosed approximately 5.2 million shares settled in connection with the Park Holidays acquisition in early April. The remaining 1 million shares were settled to fund additional acquisition activity. Additionally, earlier this month, we swapped GBP400 million of our funded GBP875 million term loan from variable rate to a fixed interest rate of 3.67% through 2025. Pro forma for the $1.8 billion of acquisitions and capital markets activity completed during and subsequent to the quarter, our net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio is inside our stated target range of 5.5 times. We have also reduced our variable rate debt exposure to 16% today as part of our active capital management strategy. Due to the addition of our manufactured housing portfolio in the UK, we will now provide an guide to core FFO on a constant currency basis. Like other REITs with non-U.S. dollar currency exposure, our constant currency adjustments eliminate the non-cash fluctuations and reporting that are due to foreign currency exchange rate movements relative to the U.S. dollar, thereby enabling investors to compare fundamental performance across time periods. We continue to see strong year-over-year growth across the platform after a great 2021 for Sun. As summarized in the press release issued yesterday, we are increasing the low end of full year guidance for constant currency FFO per share by $0.02 to a revised range of $7.22 to $7.32 per share. The $7.27 midpoint of our new range is $0.01 higher than last quarter and represents 11.7% growth over 2021 results. We are establishing third quarter 2022 constant currency core FFO per share guidance in the range of $2.56 to $2.61. At the same-property level, we are moderating our growth expectations slightly for Manufactured Housing and RV by 50 basis points to 6.4% at the midpoint of a 6% to 6.8% range. The modestly lower growth accounts for higher real estate tax assessments in Texas, one of our larger MH markets and current transient RV revenue expectations for the remainder of the year. Third quarter same-property MH and RV NOI growth is expected to be 6.8% at the midpoint of guidance. For Marina same-property, we are slightly adjusting the NOI growth range for the year by 30 basis points to 6.4% at the midpoint of 6% to 6.8% range. Third quarter same-property Marina NOI growth is expected to be 8.3% at the midpoint of guidance. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and capital markets activity through July 25, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for questions. Operator? And then Keegan to complement the second part of your question, as far as our expectations for the full year on RV transient revenue growth, we had previously stated a range of 12% at the midpoint, those expectations for the full year now are at about 6.4% with a third quarter growth on the transient side of about 4%. That's a great question. We -- to remind everyone, we are fully naturally hedged in the UK, where we paid for the transaction with borrowings on our multi-currency credit facility that includes Sterling. So any cash flow that is generated by the UK operations pays down any debt that's outstanding. We are not moving dollars back and forth to the U.S. So there is no realized gain or loss from translation. In time, if we would plan to be moving capital from the UK back into the U.S., we would look to put in cash flow hedges at that moment. As we look at our current inventory of about 28,600, 28,700 sites of transient RV sites, we would say that is a good 25% of those sites that are candidates for conversion over time. We have seen elevated conversions over the course of 2021 and certainly 2022, where we're already at 75% of last year's record figures and could expect ending 2022 with a higher conversion amount, but we still have a good runway for a number of years. And as we continue to expand our communities that does provide additional inventory for conversion over time Sure, Josh. Thank you for the question. We've primarily reclassified certain expenses mainly utilities, payroll and credit card fees to most closely aligned with the revenue drivers for those expenses. This reclassification did not have any impact unexpected growth. There was a reclassification between real property, real property revenues and expenses and service, retail, dining and entertainment revenues and expenses. Well, thank you for the question, John, I would say there are a number of items that would moderate the expected growth over the course of the second half of the year. The main contributor to that would be an easier comp in the second half of 2022 for payroll as we've shared with the market. And during July of 2021, we had increased the Sun minimum wage for all team members at the property level, and that led to much higher expense growth over the course of the last 12 months. That comp now rolls off and it's a more moderated growth in that step function increase. The moderating that would be as shared in my remarks, we did receive real estate tax assessment in Texas that was higher than our expectations. As normal course of business, we can test that assessment and then to the extent that we are successful, we then reduce that tax hit. But would expect that expense growth for the MH portfolio to be lower than what you've seen over the course of the first half of the year. And John, you mentioned, right, it's a, a very small number. It was -- you're talking about $4 million in the -- over the course of the quarter. So, the comparative growth number is larger, but we're talking about a small dollar amount. I can speak to the interest and sort of how it came about. So I think I've shared before, we've spent the last six years really building the pipeline of sites. No pun intended, the road in front of us in terms of MH development. Today, we have about 30,000 sites in various stages of entitlement that are in our pipeline and as Gary said a number of times, I think that's a unique advantage that we have. As a part of that in the markets that we look at, we talk to a lot of people as we -- it takes a lot to get them into the pipeline and we came across these resellers who were already starting to -- they're already entitled to site and started developing that site and so we took over midway through. And when we look at it fits the profile -- the investment profile of all of our development that we do, which we would expect that this is going to kick off a high single-digit IRR and in an area that has -- I will say a little bit elevated lease-up associated like we see in Texas. So it was obviously a very attractive development acquisition that we're excited about, especially the fact that we've got 400 plus sites that we could fill up rapid succession. In there small, yeah. Small figure. Sorry, I didn't hear the end of it, John, about kind of final question was... Yeah. I think that was just the timing of what was available in the market and we were just match funding to some of the acquisition activity that was going out there. Anthony, you're not. As you saw, we provided an update this morning, where we updated our expectations for this remaining six months of the year inclusive of Park Leisure and other acquisitions in the UK. That contribution at a midpoint would be -- for the next six months would be bringing in about $102.5 million to which you would add the $40.5 million that we've already realized over the course of the second quarter of the year, bringing NOI contribution to around $140 million."

            "name": "John McLaren",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Our second quarter and year-to-date performance in 2022 reflects the consistently strong operational results and contributions throughout the entire portfolio. Our same-property MH and RV NOI increased 3.6% for the quarter, driven by a 4.8% increase in revenues and offset by a 7.3% increase in property operating expenses. Our MH communities performed well with a 4.4% increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2021. Our annual RV revenue increased 12.1% driven by the high volume of transient annual conversions, which contributed revenue uplift on site in the range of 40% to 60% in the first year. For the three months ended June 30, same-property transient RV revenue increased 60 basis points even as we had 1,500 fewer sites due to our success of conversions to annuals. Weighted average rental rate increase was 4.5% for the quarter and occupancy increased by 170 basis points. Marina same-property NOI increased by 7.1% for the second quarter and 5% for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Our boat slip storage annual revenue increased 7.1% for the quarter compared to the same time last year, reflecting the positive supply and demand dynamics that Gary spoke to you earlier. We acquired two Manufactured Housing developments this quarter. Spanish Trails, an age-restricted community located in Casa Grande, Arizona and Pine Acre Trails an all-age community in Conroe, Texas. These two newly developed locations provide Sun with an immediate opportunity to supply our quality, value-oriented solutions to municipalities in need of attainable housing. Within the quarter, Sun sold over 975 new and pre-owned homes in our communities. The average new home selling price increased 7.2% for the three months ended June 30 to $164,000 with the margin approaching 20%. Additionally, in our brokered home sales, we are pleased to report a 37% increase in sales prices year-over-year demonstrating the enduring value of living in a Sun Communities. Our MH and RV total portfolio occupancy reached 97.2% as of June 30. Year-to-date, we have received approximately 29,000 applications to live in a Sun Community as demand for our communities remains robust. As Sun continues to execute on development expansion deliveries during and subsequent to quarter end, we purchased three land parcels for $10.7 million located in Colorado, Utah, and Nevada. These three entitled land parcels will provide Sun with future opportunities for greenfield development and expansion of over 650 sites in areas of high demand and needed supply. On our last call, we discussed commencing construction on five Manufactured Housing project located in Colorado, Florida, Texas and California. Construction is advancing as anticipated and we expect to have two communities open their first phases by the end of this year. Forward bookings for the total RV portfolio owned and operated by Sun are slightly ahead of last year's record pace, although, they have moderated compared to our prior expectations. Continued growth is supported by an additional base of new customers who experienced an RV vacation for the first time last year. Similar to our strong performance over the Memorial Day weekend, during 4th of July holiday, same-property transient revenue increased by 9.4% compared to 2021 and was driven by a 17.3% increase in average daily rates. We are pleased with our continued performance and are grateful for our team members who continue to go the extra mile each day. I will now turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our financial results in more detail. Fernando? Hi, Keegan. it's John. Good morning. Yeah. Our booking window for summertime stays in our RV resorts generally is between 15 to 60 days, is when we see the majority of our bookings and sort of -- it ticked up from day 60 to their stay to the 15th day, which is sort of the peak, when people come in and haven't seen a tremendous -- when a chart that out in comparison in terms of like, when bookings fall in haven't seen a whole lot difference between that in prior years. Yeah, Wes. Good morning. It's John. I think the way I'd answer that is that 2021 represents a year in our view where we enjoyed growth that was beyond anything we'd seen historically. And as we shared before recorded, record new guests sort of set the stage. To answer your question, the fact is, we're still enjoying those tailwinds and our overall RV performance thus far in 2022. Just few points of reference, since, the start of 2021, we've converted over 10% of our transient sites and annual leases, which again as I said in my remarks, there was a 40% to 60% revenue pickup in the year that they convert. Of that Mr. Gary shared in the first half of 2022, we saw continued growth converting over 1,400 sites, which is over 75% ahead of our record-setting first year -- full year of thousand 2021 conversion results. So even with a 10% reduction transient set for the last 18 months, we still grew transient in RV revenue overall in the second quarter and outlook by Fernando said 4% in the third quarter having really great Memorial Day and 4th July holidays, as well as the expectation that we would grow approximately 6% -- I think Fernando said 6.4%. I think the key there for the full year -- I think the key there, that number is actually slightly elevated against typical transient growth numbers that we have realized annually pre-COVID, but now with more conversion success and also in the face of 9% inflation, that we have today. So I think the transient is performing extremely well, it remains steady. And I think we continue to as we shared before build growth on a new base of customers we established last year. Nick, this is John. I'll just add on to that with the Park Leisure acquisition, those 11 properties really fits the sweet spot and the fact that those sites in those properties are 92% owner occupied. That was 400 expansion sites in front of it as well, so it's a really solid acquisition that we're excited about. Brad, the expectation at the touring season -- the heavy touring season for the Park Holiday's portfolio is during the third quarter and so there is an increased percentage of NOI contribution from real property during the third quarter. We can step through those percentages on a follow-up call. I don't have those figures in front of me. I think, John, I would suggest some of that is the movement that's taking place with a bigger boats that have been occupying a lot of sites through COVID, as they haven't moved around and some of that is just being picked up as they move up by the transient. So you're seeing that because there is not a lot of percentage of sites -- slips available for transient, when the season started. And so it's a little bit of movement, we were able to slip in a little bit more transient growth. John, we provided guidance during the -- right after the first quarter of G&A for the Park Holidays platform at a midpoint of about $27 million for the -- from April to December on a -- on a non-constant currency basis, that figure would be expected to be a little bit less, call it $1 million or $2 less than $27 million. No, it didn't. This is John. I talk to those guys every day."

At this time, management would like me to inform you that certain statements made during this call which are not historical facts may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can provide no assurance that its expectations will be achieved. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in yesterday’s press release and from time-to-time in the company’s periodic filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to advise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release. Having said that, I would like to introduce management with us today, Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John McLaren, President and Chief Operating Officer; Karen Dearing, Chief Financial Officer; and Fernando Castro-Caratini, Senior Vice President, Finance and Capital Markets. After their remarks, we will have an opportunity to ask questions. I will now turn the program over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good morning and thank you for joining us as we discuss our first quarter 2022 results and growth initiatives and provide an update on our outlook. As anticipated, we delivered another strong quarter building on 2021’s momentum and positioning us for another solid year as we execute on each of our growth pillars, including organic growth, accretive acquisitions and developments. For the quarter, core FFO per share was $1.34, which is a 6.3% increase over last year. The ongoing demand for attainable housing and affordable vacationing continues to be evident in our platform is driving compelling ongoing organic growth. Applications to live in a Sun Community increased 6% and same property occupancy increased 160 basis points over the same time last year. Revenue-producing sites increased by approximately 30% compared to the first quarter of 2021. The majority of those were conversions of transient RV to annual RV leases, which provides us a 50% revenue uplift within the first year. In terms of acquisitions, in the first quarter and year-to-date through this call, we have completed approximately $1.6 billion of transactions, including the £950 million or $1.2 billion acquisition of Park Holidays. We are pleased to have completed the acquisition of the Park Holidays portfolio, which expands Sun’s total addressable market and takes advantage of our relative cost of capital within a very fragmented UK market. The acquisition of these 40 properties in many highly desirable seaside locations provides Sun with an additional platform for growth, driving on our expertise and proven track record. Park Holidays is a mirror image of our manufactured housing business with the same supply and demand drivers, the key revenues and a highly experienced and dedicated management team. Our manufactured housing business ended the quarter, with 96.7% total portfolio occupancy, a 20 basis point increase over last year. With compelling demand tailwinds, we are continuing to pursue Greenfield developments and expansion opportunities. Sun is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity given our experienced development platform and team that has played an important role since we developed our first communities over 30 years ago. Within the RV business, robust demand continues as many new guests discover the joy and affordability of an RV vacation, which has only accelerated over the past 2 years. First quarter same-property RV revenue growth increased 20.5% compared to 2021. Furthermore, an outdoor industry leading monthly research report in March, indicated that 50% of campers have already booked trips for 2022, indicating the ongoing outdoor vacation in demand. Our Marina properties have also continued to perform well with overall performance exceeding our first quarter expectations. Our same-property marinas produced a 7.7% revenue increase this quarter compared to last year. Turning and subsequent to the first quarter, we added 4 marinas to our portfolio. With new locations strengthened Safe Harbor’s network effect as the largest operator of marinas in the United States. It also gives new boat owners and used boat owners additional opportunities to join as Safe Harbor members. Additionally, as you may have seen in the recent press release, I am excited to announce the promotion of Fernando Castro to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective May 2. I am pleased to have both Fernando and Karen with us on this call today to take any of your questions. Karen will play a key role in the CFO transition and will be staying on as an executive officer leading the UK integration efforts and advising on other corporate initiatives. Karen has deep experience integrating many acquisitions, including large corporate transactions, such as American Land Lease, Air Freight and Safe Harbor. With strong cycle tested record of operating, expanding and acquiring communities, Sun is favorably positioned to continue to deliver solid results. Of macro tailwinds we are seeing support growth across the business, the demand for attainable housing, outdoor vacationing and marinas slips and storage has sustained through economic cycles and Sun is uniquely positioned to meet these customer needs. Furthermore, with the closing of Park Holidays, we look forward to continuing to establish a presence among the fragmented UK market. We have a highly talented and experienced team across our entire organization and we are excited about the opportunity to continue to build and Sun’s best-in-class platform. I will now turn the call over to John and Fernando to discuss our results in further detail.\nJohn McLaren: Thank you, Gary. Our team delivered an excellent quarter of operational results. Sun same-property MH and RV NOI growth for the first quarter was 7.7%, a 150 basis point increase over the high end of guidance. This was driven by a 9.2% increase in revenues, offset by a 12.7% increase in property operating expenses. Our performance during the first quarter was driven by annual RV revenues given increased annual RV conversions and transient RV revenues, which benefited from a full return of our Canadian snowbirds and strong rate and occupancy growth in the first quarter. The weighted average rental increase was 4.2% for the quarter and occupancy increased by 160 basis points. Marinas same-property revenues were up 7.7% for the quarter, driven by rental rate, occupancy gains and transient revenues. Same-property marina NOI growth was 1.2% as certain expenses were unseasonably higher during the first quarter. The first quarter is the lowest contributor to NOI from a seasonality perspective at 18%, and therefore, higher expenses had a disproportionate impact to NOI growth. That said, current demand, leasing activity and forward visibility into the strong start to the summer boating season helps us reaffirm the full year NOI growth guidance to 6% to 7.4%. Performance for the overall marina platform exceeded expectations as we also experienced stronger demand for service by our members. Our acquisitions of approximately $1.6 billion during and subsequent to the end of the first quarter included the 41 UK properties, with over 16,700 sites and 4 marinas with nearly 900 wet slips and dry storage spaces. This also includes Sandy Bay, a popular Southern England’s [indiscernible] retirement manufactured housing community for approximately $184 million, consisting of approximately 600 occupied sites with an additional 600 expansion sites that we expect to build out over the coming years. Additionally, we disposed the three assets of Florida in the first quarter for a total of $29.6 million as we continue to optimize our portfolio. As of today, our total platform includes 644 properties throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. As Gary mentioned, applications to live in a Sun community increased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2021. For the quarter, Sun sold over 800 new and pre-owned homes in line with last year. Our new home selling price increased by almost 17% to almost $180,000 and we maintained margins compared to last year. Additionally, our brokered home selling price increased by 35.4% in the quarter, which demonstrates the value proposition for residents to come to live in a Sun community. Our total portfolio occupancy as of March 31 was 97.5%. And during the quarter, we gained 670 revenue-producing sites with the majority being RV transient annual lease conversions. Funds inventory of nearly 11,000 zone and titled manufactured housing and RV sites provides Sun with an investment pipeline to fuel growth for many years as we execute on our development plans. In addition, we have a significant pipeline of land for future development within the entitlement process that will enable us to be in a position to meet the increasing demand for attainable housing across the country. We plan to start development of 5 new Greenfield manufactured housing communities in 2022, with 2 communities actively under construction today with first phases anticipated to open late this year in Colorado and Florida. Forward bookings for our Sun-owned and operated RV resorts are pacing approximately 5% ahead compared to the same time last year for the second quarter. As you will recall, the second quarter of 2021 delivered strong results as all resorts were open in a very high demand. They are pacing 13% ahead for the second half of the year. Our RV same-property NOI growth of almost 23% compared to the first quarter of 2021 shows the continued demand for outdoor vacationing, which benefited from the Canadian border being open for our Snowbird Residency S. There is a lot of conversation around the potential impact of inflation and rising gas prices. We are also pleased to see the continued strong forward bookings for the remainder of the year, which we believe is a solid indicator of an RV vacations continued desirability. Operationally, Sun had a very positive quarter due to the diligent effort of all team members. Fernando will now discuss our financial results in more detail. Fernando?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, John. I would first like to say I am honored to be assuming the role of CFO. Sun is a tremendous company and I look forward to continuing to help drive and support our growth. I’d like to thank Karen for her mentorship and guidance through the years and look forward to collaborating with her for many years to come. For the first quarter, Sun reported core FFO per share of $1.34 and representing 6.3% growth over the first quarter of 2021 and $0.07 ahead of the top end of our first quarter guidance range. We have had an active year-to-date on the capital markets front, closing on the Park Holidays transaction on April 8 at a purchase price of approximately £950 million, which was funded entirely on our new $4.2 billion multicurrency revolving credit and term loan facility. Additionally, we settled forward equity contracts on approximately 5.2 million shares for $935 million of net proceeds. These proceeds were used to pay down U.S. dollar borrowings on our credit facility. In early April, Sun issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes. Net proceeds were used to pay down the remaining U.S. dollar balance on the revolver. In conjunction with the unsecured notes offering, Sun settled four 10-year treasury rate locks totaling $600 million for a payment to the company of $35 million, lowering our effective interest rate on the notes from 4.2% to 3.6%. We have approximately 1.2 million shares or $230 million of forward equity contracts outstanding after selling 600,000 shares at the end of the first quarter. As of March 31, Sun had $6.1 billion of debt outstanding at a 3% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 8.1 years. We had $90 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio of 5.9x. Our pro forma leverage on a fully loaded basis for all acquisition and capital markets activity to-date is in the mid-5x. Given our outperformance for the first quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year FFO per share guidance range to $7.20 to $7.32, which represents a 1.5% increase at the midpoint. Full year manufactured housing and RV same-property NOI growth is increasing to a range of 6.5% to 7.3% and we affirm full year marina same-property NOI growth at 6% to 7.4%. For additional details and second quarter expectations, please see our supplemental disclosure. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which maybe included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.\nKeegan Carl: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first, just on your MH and RV same-property NOI growth provisions. Can you give us a little bit more color behind what’s driving it?\nGary Shiffman: Hi, Keegan. The outperformance in the first quarter on MH and RV same property was really driven by the RV portfolio with stronger performance from the annual side as we exceeded our expectations of conversions of transient sites to annual leases as well as on transient revenue, both from the performance of – for the quarter based on the comp against the first quarter of 2021, where we had – where we were affected by the Canadian border closure and the California state home orders. Both of those as well as a little bit of outperformance on the MH side led to our 7.7% combined NOI growth.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Just on the transient real quick. I mean how is it trending versus your previously issued guidance?\nJohn McLaren: It’s trading – go ahead, Fernando.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: It’s trending – the expectations for the remainder of the year and for our original budget are ahead of our original expectations. For the year, we would be forecasting this is inclusive of the first quarter, somewhere between 11% to 13% growth in transient RV.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And then shifting gears a little bit here. As far as disclosure for Holiday Parks, I thought you guys classified them as MH your acquisition. Just kind of curious what the rationale is for this maybe you’re not breaking out as a separate entity? And then finally, I mean, should we expect these to be reported in the MH, RV bucket going forward?\nGary Shiffman: As far as reporting goes, I think they will be in the MH RV bucket going forward. And our view on them, as we’ve shared, is that they are more permanent than our manufacturing housing homes here in the U.S. and that they are actually a truck down a lower to the site, craned onto the site tied down to the ground, and they do not have the types of wheels and axles that we have here in the U.S. So they are not as permanent as they can be. And then the fact that the average licenses as they call them there as opposed to leases around 20 to 30 years, makes it kind of what we would consider the quintessential land lease type community. So we are about as much as we can compare to manufactured housing as we’ve seen out there. They do – they are second homes, however, they must have a primary resonance in order to acquire and be licensed in a holiday park, and primarily, therefore, vacationing as a second business.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Very clear.\nKaren Dearing: To be clear, the team will be going through, just like they did for the Marinas, they’ll be going through all of our reporting and all of the considerations regarding segments and supplemental reporting and really to create the most transparent way to view the Holiday Parks and particularly planning for them going into the future and being included in the same community. But we do truly see them as manufactured housing.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Very clear. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Good morning. Congratulations to Karen and Fernando. The Marina performance on NOI came in a little bit light due to high expenses as you alluded to. I was wondering if you could break down the same-store Marina revenue and expense guidance for 2022.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure, John. This is Fernando. So we are – on the NOI side, we affirmed guidance at 6% to 7.4%. This would translate to – at the midpoint to revenue growth of about 6% and expense growth of about 5%.\nJohn Kim: So why was the first quarter unusually high on expenses?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: It was a little bit higher due to utility costs in the quarter that were unseasonably higher. But the – as we look at – as we have visibility towards the remainder of the year, both from a top line and expense standpoint, we did make adjustments that will help us hit the original guidance of 6% to 7.4%. We had stronger revenue growth on the wet slip and dry storage spaces. And overall, the Marina platform did exceed our first quarter expectations with stronger service demand from our members.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And then John mentioned in your prepared remarks that forward bookings for RVs are trending 5% kind of last year in the second quarter. Your guidance for same-store MH and RV is just 3.9% at the midpoint. What’s the offset to the higher demand you’re seeing on the RV side?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: John, the offset – it would have been an offset from a comp standpoint, we did have the first quarter of 2021, where we had around $6 million less in that quarter because of the Canadian border closure and the California stay at home orders than we would have expected. So the – we’re not expecting close to 30% revenue growth in – for the rest of the year on the RV side given that the comparables for the remainder of the year are more normalized from that perspective.\nJohn Kim: Right. But bookings are 5% ahead of schedule for RV. So is MH slowing that down below that? Or is it fewer conversions to transient? Or I’m just wondering why the guidance doesn’t suggest something higher than 3.9%?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: We have in the in – as we’ve shared before, we instituted a payroll increase across the portfolio that is impacting expenses for the first half of the year. We saw that impact in the first quarter and would expect that again in the second quarter expense growth for the second half of the year will normalize as we don’t have that step function increase that went in, in July of 2021.\nJohn Kim: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with our question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thank you for the time. John, on the RV rental rate side, 6% rent growth in the quarter. Should we expect that to accelerate from here or kind of hold steady in the 6% range?\nJohn McLaren: John. I appreciate the question. I think it’s going to hold steady. It could be up a little bit.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Great. And then last one for me. In terms of the UK Park holiday G&A. So should we expect additional step changes in year 2 and 3 of owning this business similar to what we saw with Safe Harbor trying to get comfortable around the scalability of the expenses that are hitting right now and what’s to come beyond this year?\nKaren Dearing: I think that Park Holidays is a small – they are a smaller business that we are changing them from privately held company to us of a publicly held company. So there although they have placed some of those increases in their G&A for 2022, we will see what the future holds. And dependent on acquisition activity and things of that nature, you may see some amount of increase into the following year just to really bring them up to the level that they need to be in order to provide the reporting and the timing of reporting along with all of their statutory reporting requirements in the UK.\nGary Shiffman: It’s Gary, John. I’ll just add to that point, I think the opportunity we’re looking at with expansion taking place there right now, 700 sites that are under construction of 700 sites beyond that. Any additional G&A would be commensurate with the outsized growth we expect to get there. So as we really operate for the first 12 months, we would expect to be certain scalability and yet certain increased G&A as we get through all of the adjustments to get into the reporting here properly in the U.S. and to support their continued growth out there. So I think we will be able to share more quarter-by-quarter with you.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. But in terms of G&A as a percent of revenues for Park Holidays, we should expect it to be stable beyond this year?\nKaren Dearing: Yes, I think that would be the case.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi. Please proceed with the question.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. Maybe just starting off, I just wanted to clarify something. So the first quarter same-store marina performance was actually ahead of expectations. Is that right? Because there was some conversation obviously around the expenses and kind of the remainder of the year, but I just wanted to clarify the exceeded expectations? Or is that relative to the entire portfolio?\nJohn McLaren: Nick, relative to the entire portfolio, we exceeded our expectations with stronger demand for service from our members. Our – on the same-property side, we did have the 1.2% growth, which was slightly below our original expectations. But as John explained during the prepared remarks, the first quarter is the lowest contributor from a seasonality perspective. So, a few hundred thousand dollars have an outsized impact on the performance for the quarter. That being said, the top line performed extremely well and visibility into the start of the northern boating season has us very excited for what we can deliver for the rest of the year.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then maybe just on marinas, there were some press articles yesterday on one of the large owners considering its future plans. How does their portfolio compare to Safe Harbor? And then would new capital sources for the company increased competition for Marina acquisition?\nJohn McLaren: It’s Gary, Nick. I think that we filed Suntex for the last 5 years as we filed safe harbor in the Marina business. And certainly, appreciate the fact that they have been growing to a scale that they are considering an IPO as one of their alternatives. There has been very little change to the general market, to the cap rates as Safe Harbor has been able to increase its size by over 60% in an 18, 20-month period of time, very, very carefully thought through strategic acquisitions to improve the footprint, network, the membership and my expectation would be that with a fragmented business with the current availability of Sun Securities and the networking through the patriotic’s so influential in the industry that reside over at Safe Harbor that we should be able to continue to grow regardless of Suntex pull to continue to grow or to do an IPO or anything like that. So for the foreseeable future, Safe Harbor really has the ability to proceed as it’s been proceeding.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hi, everyone. Just curious on the Marina same-store, what – it looks like you just include property operating expenses. I think it’s my understanding, and please correct me if I’m wrong, but if that does not include waiver? And then if it’s like outside waiver and if it doesn’t, what’s the rationale for not including that in Marina same-store expenses?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Josh, we our Marina same-store is on a real property basis. We are evaluating and could potentially in the future, report service, retail, dining and entertainment on a same-store basis as well, and we can update the market at that time. But it includes all of the expenses that go into operating the marina.\nKaren Dearing: Including payroll to operate the Marina.\nJoshua Dennerlein: All including payroll, so like mechanic, stock hands that’s included in the property operating expenses or somewhere else?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: If that labor is working on servicing a vessel, that is included in expenses for SR D&E.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay.\nGary Shiffman: The fuel docs, everything else that’s related to the actual operating of the wet slips and dry storage is included everything.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Included in – is it included in that $24.4 million for same-store? Or...\nGary Shiffman: It’s included in the same-store that we reported.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. I will follow-up offline. And then my other question is related to Park Holidays, you mentioned that the resident has to get a license to have that home. Is that from the government or as you as the owner?\nJohn McLaren: No. This is – that’s basically equates on our side to having at least the terminology is a license and basically guarantees them the ability to have that site anywhere from 20 years to 30 years, Josh. So, it’s from Park Holidays.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. So, that’s something you could change if you wanted to. Would that be something you would be willing to change, or you would like this kind of set up?\nGary Shiffman: If we saw a reason to change it, we could change it, yes.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Awesome…\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Yes, going forward, yes.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Alright. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nWes Golladay: Hi everyone. I just want to look at the second half pace. I believe you said it was up 13%. At this time, how much do you have on the books for the second half? And is that mostly driven by rate or occupancy?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: I don’t have the figure of what we actually have on the books right in front of me, Wes, but it’s a balance between both. I mean typically, I think we have seen again, a pretty even balance between both rate and occupancy. One of the things that we have been really focused on is those extensions into the shoulder days. They are around the normal Saturday stay that you might have and picking up more Mondays, picking up more Thursdays along the way to extend that a bit.\nWes Golladay: Got it. And can you provide an update on your loyalty program initiatives right now?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. It’s – so we have got a number of properties that are still in that program. We are going to continue to keep it in pilot mode, if you will, probably for the next six months because obviously, the learnings have been enlightening through the process. We have got, I think approximately 5,000 members within the loyalty program today. And it’s, like I said, it’s important to keep it in pilot stage until we go to a full launch and just gather the learnings that we are picking up along the way. Much of what the benefit that our guests are getting within the pilot from the program are geared towards bringing them back to the properties and growing the spend within the properties rather than outside of the loyalty program.\nWes Golladay: Got it. And then on the acquisition front – sorry.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: I will look forward to updating you as subsequent calls along the way too, as we get closer.\nWes Golladay: Okay. And then on the acquisition front, looking at the Jarrett Bay assets, there is not a lot of slips there. Maybe can you talk about what you are thinking of those assets?\nGary Shiffman: Wes, it’s Gary. Jarrett Bay really is a very strategic acquisition for Safe Harbor. It does have potential for split expansion. But it’s one of the very few service centers for large vessels situated between Maryland and Georgia. It’s in close proximity to one of our very large Marina, City Marina and Charleston and is a perfect network addition, as I said, for Safe Harbor members traveling north and south on the East Coast between our Southern old port Cove, Rivet and Lauderdale Marina in the south all the way up to our Northern Newport Beach and other Marinas. So, we just think it’s a great opportunity to expand the network capabilities for our members, and that is part of the underlying strategy that we think differentiates Safe Harbor from any of the competition.\nWes Golladay: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSamir Khanal: Yes. Hi, good morning everyone. Gary, can you talk about expand on the transaction market a little bit more? I know you provided a little bit of color on the marina side, but just kind of looking at what you are seeing in the overall market in light of bond yield moving up? And maybe there is a way to kind of talk about sort of MH and RV sort of bifurcate that and sort of the demand you are seeing?\nGary Shiffman: Sure. It’s an interesting question, Samir. I can sit here and tell everybody that we have seen no impact to cap rates and either the MH/RV or marina space thus far. I think the best example of that is that John shared with you the fact that we disposed of three manufactured housing communities last quarter and the cap rate on a trailing basis was 3.5%. These obviously were not in our trophy assets. So, it gives you some sense of the demand that’s out there. I think looking forward for right now what we have in the pipeline reflects pretty much what we have had for some time now on the manufactured housing side is strictly relationship-oriented. And oftentimes, we can’t use Sun securities or tax deferral to make transactions. And I think that there is continued focus on that and a little bit more interest by people and relationships we have talked to. We are seeing the interest rate environment change. So, we suspect in onesies and twosies to be able to capture that manufactured housing acquisition type property. At the same time, recognizing that manufactured housing has been so consolidated. We have definitely ratcheted up our desire to increase new development of manufactured housing where we can build to higher yields than buy. John shared with you, we expect to be developing approximately five new manufactured housing communities per year going forward and have geared up for that for the last 4 years or 5 years. And then we look to the UK for really an exciting opportunity on both the Holiday Park side to continue to expand their communities and look for additional acquisitions. Those appear to be in cap rates that are 300 points to 400 points higher than what we are seeing in the U.S. So, great opportunity there. And then on the marina side, as I shared with you earlier, still a very fragmented industry with limited competition. So, we expect to continue to deploy capital on external growth through acquisitions in marina as well.\nSamir Khanal: Great. Thanks for the color. And I guess just switching gears on the marina same-store NOI growth. And I know for the second quarter, you have provided a pretty wide range, right, like $57 million to $73 million. Just trying to understand, basically sort of two months left in the quarter, can you talk about kind of what the swing factor is to get you kind of the low end and the top end of that range?\nGary Shiffman: Well. Certainly it is a wide range, and we are early into the season. I think John shared in his remarks that or Fernando, we are seeing strong demand, we are seeing the extension of certain leases that perhaps some of the vessels would have been traveling across the Atlantic overseas, but for some of the geopolitical situation taking there. So, we are kind of excited about what we see, and we will look towards the next call to be able to share the actual results.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: And Samir, just for reference, right. It’s a smaller portfolio, standalone portfolio from a marina standpoint. So again, a shift of a few dollars has a greater impact both up or down. So, that’s why the range is just slightly – it doesn’t amount to a large dollar amount from a range standpoint.\nSamir Khanal: Got it. And my last question, if I may, Fernando, on the expense growth for the balance of the year? I mean how should we think about the cadence of that in the remaining quarters here?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: As shared earlier, we are expecting expense growth to be somewhere around the 5% range on a full year basis. So, a deceleration from what we saw in the first quarter is expected.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question and congratulations on your new roles, Karen and Fernando. As we think about MH rents keeping pace with inflation, same-property MH rent per site in the first quarter came in below the low end of your initial guidance range of 4% to 4.2%. And – as we think about how that progresses, should that accelerate through the year and finish above the high end of the range? And does that kind of become the run rate going forward above 4.2%?\nJohn McLaren: This is John. Thanks for the question. The quick answer to your question is yes. Our guided MH rent increase for 2022 at the midpoint is 4.1%, which is, as you know, already above our historical range. I think going forward we are going to have some good opportunity over the course of 2022 to potentially achieve higher than that range as more MH move-ins and re-sales take place across the portfolio over the balance of the year. And then even in locations such as Florida and California, where many of those rent increases are tied to some form of CPI, I expect to see higher increases as the year progresses and into 2023. So, yes, I mean again, the quick answer is yes, we expect it to accelerate.\nMichael Goldsmith: That’s really helpful. And then as we think about transient RV, it was ahead of expectations in the first quarter. It seems like forward bookings? Have you ahead of last year? Does this change how you think about kind of like where the ultimate level of transient RV demand falls relative to pre-COVID levels?\nJohn McLaren: Yes. I will put it this way. RV performance is nothing short of outstanding, okay. We had over 230,000 new guests in our resorts last year, which in part led to the record high conversions of transient to annual leases that we had was 1,700, which was like a 70% increase over any other year. So, we had in conversions as well as close to 600 conversions in the first quarter alone. So, that – the booking pace being 13% ahead of the second half of last year represents a record upon a record okay, that we have. And so as I said on other calls, it’s like we established a new baseline to grow from, and we look for that to continue to grow.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks. And if I can squeeze one more in. It’s been five months since you announced the transaction for Park Holidays. How has that market evolved since then? Have valuations changed? Has competition evolved? And then do you see yourself bidding on some of the larger portfolios, or is this a roll-up of kind of the onesies and twosies from here on?\nGary Shiffman: I think – this is Gary and John can add. He has really been working closely with the Park Group and everything we are doing out there. But I think we see things pretty steady as we saw when we first entered the space. Obviously, there is a lot of interest in focus when Sun makes an important move in a new country like that. There are a lot of people out there looking at the asset class. But we would look at mostly onesies and twosies and really levering off of a 15-year expertise of the management that’s in place to grow the existing communities to acquire new ground, to apply their skills and their sales force to build new communities as well as consolidate in the onesies and twosies. So, that would be our focus. I think the larger portfolios that we know, obviously, we see they are presented to us, but the complexities involved are far from the simple business that we look for there, which is increasing our manufactured housing communities because of the stickiness of the rent and all the real characteristics that make it so attractive for growth. So, it will be the onesies and in twosies, maybe small portfolio, much like we do here right now.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe a follow-up to that question. How are cap rates for the onesies and twosies in the UK compared to portfolio cap rate? And how to both compare to what you are seeing for an MH in the U.S.?\nGary Shiffman: I want to be careful what I say here because the pipeline is so full, and we are negotiating in a proprietary way with so many people over there. But I am going to suggest that the cap rates – exceed cap rates here by more than 400 basis points at least.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Alright. Thanks for that. And maybe just switching gears to the development. You mentioned you are doing five new communities per year. Is there maybe an opportunity to increase that? We have seen a lot more concern with portable housing options in the U.S., has the conversation changed with local communities regarding MH development? And is that an opportunity for you over the long run?\nJohn McLaren: Hi. This is John. Thanks. Yes, the answer to that is yes. Like we shared before, we have five new MH ground-up starts that are happening this year, two are in the ground. Interesting thing that’s taken place, we actually have added a couple more to that account with respect to MH projects that were in flight by others that we are developing them that we have taken over those projects. And so really, what we expect to start this year is going to be more in the range of seven to eight MH communities as a result of that. So, we will continue to look for those opportunities to add to that five a year that we have shared that we expect to do.\nAnthony Powell: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions. I would like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nJohn McLaren: This is – Gary and I too, would like to congratulate Fernando and Karen. Thank you all for your participation. As I always close, we are all available for any follow-up questions. We are very excited for the growth opportunity we have in front of us and look forward to reporting next quarter. Thank you everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

But we do truly see them as manufactured housing. I think that Park Holidays is a small – they are a smaller business that we are changing them from privately held company to us of a publicly held company. So there although they have placed some of those increases in their G&A for 2022, we will see what the future holds. And dependent on acquisition activity and things of that nature, you may see some amount of increase into the following year just to really bring them up to the level that they need to be in order to provide the reporting and the timing of reporting along with all of their statutory reporting requirements in the UK. Yes, I think that would be the case. Including payroll to operate the Marina."

            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us as we discuss our first quarter 2022 results and growth initiatives and provide an update on our outlook. As anticipated, we delivered another strong quarter building on 2021's momentum and positioning us for another solid year as we execute on each of our growth pillars, including organic growth, accretive acquisitions and developments. For the quarter, core FFO per share was $1.34, which is a 6.3% increase over last year. The ongoing demand for attainable housing and affordable vacationing continues to be evident in our platform is driving compelling ongoing organic growth. Applications to live in a Sun Community increased 6% and same property occupancy increased 160 basis points over the same time last year. Revenue-producing sites increased by approximately 30% compared to the first quarter of 2021. The majority of those were conversions of transient RV to annual RV leases, which provides us a 50% revenue uplift within the first year. In terms of acquisitions, in the first quarter and year-to-date through this call, we have completed approximately $1.6 billion of transactions, including the £950 million or $1.2 billion acquisition of Park Holidays. We are pleased to have completed the acquisition of the Park Holidays portfolio, which expands Sun's total addressable market and takes advantage of our relative cost of capital within a very fragmented UK market. The acquisition of these 40 properties in many highly desirable seaside locations provides Sun with an additional platform for growth, driving on our expertise and proven track record. Park Holidays is a mirror image of our manufactured housing business with the same supply and demand drivers, the key revenues and a highly experienced and dedicated management team. Our manufactured housing business ended the quarter, with 96.7% total portfolio occupancy, a 20 basis point increase over last year. With compelling demand tailwinds, we are continuing to pursue Greenfield developments and expansion opportunities. Sun is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity given our experienced development platform and team that has played an important role since we developed our first communities over 30 years ago. Within the RV business, robust demand continues as many new guests discover the joy and affordability of an RV vacation, which has only accelerated over the past 2 years. First quarter same-property RV revenue growth increased 20.5% compared to 2021. Furthermore, an outdoor industry leading monthly research report in March, indicated that 50% of campers have already booked trips for 2022, indicating the ongoing outdoor vacation in demand. Our Marina properties have also continued to perform well with overall performance exceeding our first quarter expectations. Our same-property marinas produced a 7.7% revenue increase this quarter compared to last year. Turning and subsequent to the first quarter, we added 4 marinas to our portfolio. With new locations strengthened Safe Harbor's network effect as the largest operator of marinas in the United States. It also gives new boat owners and used boat owners additional opportunities to join as Safe Harbor members. Additionally, as you may have seen in the recent press release, I am excited to announce the promotion of Fernando Castro to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective May 2. I am pleased to have both Fernando and Karen with us on this call today to take any of your questions. Karen will play a key role in the CFO transition and will be staying on as an executive officer leading the UK integration efforts and advising on other corporate initiatives. Karen has deep experience integrating many acquisitions, including large corporate transactions, such as American Land Lease, Air Freight and Safe Harbor. With strong cycle tested record of operating, expanding and acquiring communities, Sun is favorably positioned to continue to deliver solid results. Of macro tailwinds we are seeing support growth across the business, the demand for attainable housing, outdoor vacationing and marinas slips and storage has sustained through economic cycles and Sun is uniquely positioned to meet these customer needs. Furthermore, with the closing of Park Holidays, we look forward to continuing to establish a presence among the fragmented UK market. We have a highly talented and experienced team across our entire organization and we are excited about the opportunity to continue to build and Sun's best-in-class platform. I will now turn the call over to John and Fernando to discuss our results in further detail. Hi, Keegan. The outperformance in the first quarter on MH and RV same property was really driven by the RV portfolio with stronger performance from the annual side as we exceeded our expectations of conversions of transient sites to annual leases as well as on transient revenue, both from the performance of – for the quarter based on the comp against the first quarter of 2021, where we had – where we were affected by the Canadian border closure and the California state home orders. Both of those as well as a little bit of outperformance on the MH side led to our 7.7% combined NOI growth. As far as reporting goes, I think they will be in the MH RV bucket going forward. And our view on them, as we've shared, is that they are more permanent than our manufacturing housing homes here in the U.S. and that they are actually a truck down a lower to the site, craned onto the site tied down to the ground, and they do not have the types of wheels and axles that we have here in the U.S. So they are not as permanent as they can be. And then the fact that the average licenses as they call them there as opposed to leases around 20 to 30 years, makes it kind of what we would consider the quintessential land lease type community. So we are about as much as we can compare to manufactured housing as we've seen out there. They do – they are second homes, however, they must have a primary resonance in order to acquire and be licensed in a holiday park, and primarily, therefore, vacationing as a second business. It's Gary, John. I'll just add to that point, I think the opportunity we're looking at with expansion taking place there right now, 700 sites that are under construction of 700 sites beyond that. Any additional G&A would be commensurate with the outsized growth we expect to get there. So as we really operate for the first 12 months, we would expect to be certain scalability and yet certain increased G&A as we get through all of the adjustments to get into the reporting here properly in the U.S. and to support their continued growth out there. So I think we will be able to share more quarter-by-quarter with you. The fuel docs, everything else that's related to the actual operating of the wet slips and dry storage is included everything. It's included in the same-store that we reported. If we saw a reason to change it, we could change it, yes. Wes, it's Gary. Jarrett Bay really is a very strategic acquisition for Safe Harbor. It does have potential for split expansion. But it's one of the very few service centers for large vessels situated between Maryland and Georgia. It's in close proximity to one of our very large Marina, City Marina and Charleston and is a perfect network addition, as I said, for Safe Harbor members traveling north and south on the East Coast between our Southern old port Cove, Rivet and Lauderdale Marina in the south all the way up to our Northern Newport Beach and other Marinas. So, we just think it's a great opportunity to expand the network capabilities for our members, and that is part of the underlying strategy that we think differentiates Safe Harbor from any of the competition. Sure. It's an interesting question, Samir. I can sit here and tell everybody that we have seen no impact to cap rates and either the MH/RV or marina space thus far. I think the best example of that is that John shared with you the fact that we disposed of three manufactured housing communities last quarter and the cap rate on a trailing basis was 3.5%. These obviously were not in our trophy assets. So, it gives you some sense of the demand that's out there. I think looking forward for right now what we have in the pipeline reflects pretty much what we have had for some time now on the manufactured housing side is strictly relationship-oriented. And oftentimes, we can't use Sun securities or tax deferral to make transactions. And I think that there is continued focus on that and a little bit more interest by people and relationships we have talked to. We are seeing the interest rate environment change. So, we suspect in onesies and twosies to be able to capture that manufactured housing acquisition type property. At the same time, recognizing that manufactured housing has been so consolidated. We have definitely ratcheted up our desire to increase new development of manufactured housing where we can build to higher yields than buy. John shared with you, we expect to be developing approximately five new manufactured housing communities per year going forward and have geared up for that for the last 4 years or 5 years. And then we look to the UK for really an exciting opportunity on both the Holiday Park side to continue to expand their communities and look for additional acquisitions. Those appear to be in cap rates that are 300 points to 400 points higher than what we are seeing in the U.S. So, great opportunity there. And then on the marina side, as I shared with you earlier, still a very fragmented industry with limited competition. So, we expect to continue to deploy capital on external growth through acquisitions in marina as well. Well. Certainly it is a wide range, and we are early into the season. I think John shared in his remarks that or Fernando, we are seeing strong demand, we are seeing the extension of certain leases that perhaps some of the vessels would have been traveling across the Atlantic overseas, but for some of the geopolitical situation taking there. So, we are kind of excited about what we see, and we will look towards the next call to be able to share the actual results. I think – this is Gary and John can add. He has really been working closely with the Park Group and everything we are doing out there. But I think we see things pretty steady as we saw when we first entered the space. Obviously, there is a lot of interest in focus when Sun makes an important move in a new country like that. There are a lot of people out there looking at the asset class. But we would look at mostly onesies and twosies and really levering off of a 15-year expertise of the management that's in place to grow the existing communities to acquire new ground, to apply their skills and their sales force to build new communities as well as consolidate in the onesies and twosies.

I think the larger portfolios that we know, obviously, we see they are presented to us, but the complexities involved are far from the simple business that we look for there, which is increasing our manufactured housing communities because of the stickiness of the rent and all the real characteristics that make it so attractive for growth. So, it will be the onesies and in twosies, maybe small portfolio, much like we do here right now. I want to be careful what I say here because the pipeline is so full, and we are negotiating in a proprietary way with so many people over there. But I am going to suggest that the cap rates – exceed cap rates here by more than 400 basis points at least."

            "content": "Thank you, John. I would first like to say I am honored to be assuming the role of CFO. Sun is a tremendous company and I look forward to continuing to help drive and support our growth. I'd like to thank Karen for her mentorship and guidance through the years and look forward to collaborating with her for many years to come. For the first quarter, Sun reported core FFO per share of $1.34 and representing 6.3% growth over the first quarter of 2021 and $0.07 ahead of the top end of our first quarter guidance range. We have had an active year-to-date on the capital markets front, closing on the Park Holidays transaction on April 8 at a purchase price of approximately £950 million, which was funded entirely on our new $4.2 billion multicurrency revolving credit and term loan facility. Additionally, we settled forward equity contracts on approximately 5.2 million shares for $935 million of net proceeds. These proceeds were used to pay down U.S. dollar borrowings on our credit facility. In early April, Sun issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes. Net proceeds were used to pay down the remaining U.S. dollar balance on the revolver. In conjunction with the unsecured notes offering, Sun settled four 10-year treasury rate locks totaling $600 million for a payment to the company of $35 million, lowering our effective interest rate on the notes from 4.2% to 3.6%. We have approximately 1.2 million shares or $230 million of forward equity contracts outstanding after selling 600,000 shares at the end of the first quarter. As of March 31, Sun had $6.1 billion of debt outstanding at a 3% weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 8.1 years. We had $90 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio of 5.9x. Our pro forma leverage on a fully loaded basis for all acquisition and capital markets activity to-date is in the mid-5x. Given our outperformance for the first quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year FFO per share guidance range to $7.20 to $7.32, which represents a 1.5% increase at the midpoint. Full year manufactured housing and RV same-property NOI growth is increasing to a range of 6.5% to 7.3% and we affirm full year marina same-property NOI growth at 6% to 7.4%. For additional details and second quarter expectations, please see our supplemental disclosure. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call, but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which maybe included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator? It's trending – the expectations for the remainder of the year and for our original budget are ahead of our original expectations. For the year, we would be forecasting this is inclusive of the first quarter, somewhere between 11% to 13% growth in transient RV. Sure, John. This is Fernando. So we are – on the NOI side, we affirmed guidance at 6% to 7.4%. This would translate to – at the midpoint to revenue growth of about 6% and expense growth of about 5%. It was a little bit higher due to utility costs in the quarter that were unseasonably higher. But the – as we look at – as we have visibility towards the remainder of the year, both from a top line and expense standpoint, we did make adjustments that will help us hit the original guidance of 6% to 7.4%. We had stronger revenue growth on the wet slip and dry storage spaces. And overall, the Marina platform did exceed our first quarter expectations with stronger service demand from our members. John, the offset – it would have been an offset from a comp standpoint, we did have the first quarter of 2021, where we had around $6 million less in that quarter because of the Canadian border closure and the California stay at home orders than we would have expected. So the – we're not expecting close to 30% revenue growth in – for the rest of the year on the RV side given that the comparables for the remainder of the year are more normalized from that perspective. We have in the in – as we've shared before, we instituted a payroll increase across the portfolio that is impacting expenses for the first half of the year. We saw that impact in the first quarter and would expect that again in the second quarter expense growth for the second half of the year will normalize as we don't have that step function increase that went in, in July of 2021. Josh, we our Marina same-store is on a real property basis. We are evaluating and could potentially in the future, report service, retail, dining and entertainment on a same-store basis as well, and we can update the market at that time. But it includes all of the expenses that go into operating the marina. If that labor is working on servicing a vessel, that is included in expenses for SR D&E. Yes, going forward, yes. I don't have the figure of what we actually have on the books right in front of me, Wes, but it's a balance between both. I mean typically, I think we have seen again, a pretty even balance between both rate and occupancy. One of the things that we have been really focused on is those extensions into the shoulder days. They are around the normal Saturday stay that you might have and picking up more Mondays, picking up more Thursdays along the way to extend that a bit. Sure. It's – so we have got a number of properties that are still in that program. We are going to continue to keep it in pilot mode, if you will, probably for the next six months because obviously, the learnings have been enlightening through the process. We have got, I think approximately 5,000 members within the loyalty program today. And it's, like I said, it's important to keep it in pilot stage until we go to a full launch and just gather the learnings that we are picking up along the way. Much of what the benefit that our guests are getting within the pilot from the program are geared towards bringing them back to the properties and growing the spend within the properties rather than outside of the loyalty program. I will look forward to updating you as subsequent calls along the way too, as we get closer. And Samir, just for reference, right. It's a smaller portfolio, standalone portfolio from a marina standpoint. So again, a shift of a few dollars has a greater impact both up or down. So, that's why the range is just slightly – it doesn't amount to a large dollar amount from a range standpoint. As shared earlier, we are expecting expense growth to be somewhere around the 5% range on a full year basis. So, a deceleration from what we saw in the first quarter is expected."

            "name": "John McLaren",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Our team delivered an excellent quarter of operational results. Sun same-property MH and RV NOI growth for the first quarter was 7.7%, a 150 basis point increase over the high end of guidance. This was driven by a 9.2% increase in revenues, offset by a 12.7% increase in property operating expenses. Our performance during the first quarter was driven by annual RV revenues given increased annual RV conversions and transient RV revenues, which benefited from a full return of our Canadian snowbirds and strong rate and occupancy growth in the first quarter. The weighted average rental increase was 4.2% for the quarter and occupancy increased by 160 basis points. Marinas same-property revenues were up 7.7% for the quarter, driven by rental rate, occupancy gains and transient revenues. Same-property marina NOI growth was 1.2% as certain expenses were unseasonably higher during the first quarter. The first quarter is the lowest contributor to NOI from a seasonality perspective at 18%, and therefore, higher expenses had a disproportionate impact to NOI growth. That said, current demand, leasing activity and forward visibility into the strong start to the summer boating season helps us reaffirm the full year NOI growth guidance to 6% to 7.4%. Performance for the overall marina platform exceeded expectations as we also experienced stronger demand for service by our members. Our acquisitions of approximately $1.6 billion during and subsequent to the end of the first quarter included the 41 UK properties, with over 16,700 sites and 4 marinas with nearly 900 wet slips and dry storage spaces. This also includes Sandy Bay, a popular Southern England's [indiscernible] retirement manufactured housing community for approximately $184 million, consisting of approximately 600 occupied sites with an additional 600 expansion sites that we expect to build out over the coming years. Additionally, we disposed the three assets of Florida in the first quarter for a total of $29.6 million as we continue to optimize our portfolio. As of today, our total platform includes 644 properties throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. As Gary mentioned, applications to live in a Sun community increased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2021. For the quarter, Sun sold over 800 new and pre-owned homes in line with last year. Our new home selling price increased by almost 17% to almost $180,000 and we maintained margins compared to last year. Additionally, our brokered home selling price increased by 35.4% in the quarter, which demonstrates the value proposition for residents to come to live in a Sun community. Our total portfolio occupancy as of March 31 was 97.5%. And during the quarter, we gained 670 revenue-producing sites with the majority being RV transient annual lease conversions. Funds inventory of nearly 11,000 zone and titled manufactured housing and RV sites provides Sun with an investment pipeline to fuel growth for many years as we execute on our development plans. In addition, we have a significant pipeline of land for future development within the entitlement process that will enable us to be in a position to meet the increasing demand for attainable housing across the country. We plan to start development of 5 new Greenfield manufactured housing communities in 2022, with 2 communities actively under construction today with first phases anticipated to open late this year in Colorado and Florida. Forward bookings for our Sun-owned and operated RV resorts are pacing approximately 5% ahead compared to the same time last year for the second quarter. As you will recall, the second quarter of 2021 delivered strong results as all resorts were open in a very high demand. They are pacing 13% ahead for the second half of the year. Our RV same-property NOI growth of almost 23% compared to the first quarter of 2021 shows the continued demand for outdoor vacationing, which benefited from the Canadian border being open for our Snowbird Residency S. There is a lot of conversation around the potential impact of inflation and rising gas prices. We are also pleased to see the continued strong forward bookings for the remainder of the year, which we believe is a solid indicator of an RV vacations continued desirability. Operationally, Sun had a very positive quarter due to the diligent effort of all team members. Fernando will now discuss our financial results in more detail. Fernando? It's trading – go ahead, Fernando. John. I appreciate the question. I think it's going to hold steady. It could be up a little bit. Nick, relative to the entire portfolio, we exceeded our expectations with stronger demand for service from our members. Our – on the same-property side, we did have the 1.2% growth, which was slightly below our original expectations. But as John explained during the prepared remarks, the first quarter is the lowest contributor from a seasonality perspective. So, a few hundred thousand dollars have an outsized impact on the performance for the quarter. That being said, the top line performed extremely well and visibility into the start of the northern boating season has us very excited for what we can deliver for the rest of the year. It's Gary, Nick. I think that we filed Suntex for the last 5 years as we filed safe harbor in the Marina business. And certainly, appreciate the fact that they have been growing to a scale that they are considering an IPO as one of their alternatives. There has been very little change to the general market, to the cap rates as Safe Harbor has been able to increase its size by over 60% in an 18, 20-month period of time, very, very carefully thought through strategic acquisitions to improve the footprint, network, the membership and my expectation would be that with a fragmented business with the current availability of Sun Securities and the networking through the patriotic's so influential in the industry that reside over at Safe Harbor that we should be able to continue to grow regardless of Suntex pull to continue to grow or to do an IPO or anything like that. So for the foreseeable future, Safe Harbor really has the ability to proceed as it's been proceeding. No. This is – that's basically equates on our side to having at least the terminology is a license and basically guarantees them the ability to have that site anywhere from 20 years to 30 years, Josh. So, it's from Park Holidays. This is John. Thanks for the question. The quick answer to your question is yes. Our guided MH rent increase for 2022 at the midpoint is 4.1%, which is, as you know, already above our historical range. I think going forward we are going to have some good opportunity over the course of 2022 to potentially achieve higher than that range as more MH move-ins and re-sales take place across the portfolio over the balance of the year. And then even in locations such as Florida and California, where many of those rent increases are tied to some form of CPI, I expect to see higher increases as the year progresses and into 2023. So, yes, I mean again, the quick answer is yes, we expect it to accelerate. Yes. I will put it this way. RV performance is nothing short of outstanding, okay. We had over 230,000 new guests in our resorts last year, which in part led to the record high conversions of transient to annual leases that we had was 1,700, which was like a 70% increase over any other year. So, we had in conversions as well as close to 600 conversions in the first quarter alone. So, that – the booking pace being 13% ahead of the second half of last year represents a record upon a record okay, that we have. And so as I said on other calls, it's like we established a new baseline to grow from, and we look for that to continue to grow. Hi. This is John. Thanks. Yes, the answer to that is yes. Like we shared before, we have five new MH ground-up starts that are happening this year, two are in the ground. Interesting thing that's taken place, we actually have added a couple more to that account with respect to MH projects that were in flight by others that we are developing them that we have taken over those projects. And so really, what we expect to start this year is going to be more in the range of seven to eight MH communities as a result of that. So, we will continue to look for those opportunities to add to that five a year that we have shared that we expect to do. This is – Gary and I too, would like to congratulate Fernando and Karen. Thank you all for your participation. As I always close, we are all available for any follow-up questions. We are very excited for the growth opportunity we have in front of us and look forward to reporting next quarter. Thank you everyone."

At this time, management would like me to inform you that certain statements made during this call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although, the company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can provide no assurance that its expectations will be achieved. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in yesterday's press release and from time to time in the company's periodic filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to advise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release. Having said that, I would like to introduce management with us today: Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Fernando Castro-Caratini, Chief Financial Officer. After their remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss fourth quarter and full year results for 2023 and our guidance for 2024. 2023 results demonstrated the resiliency of our best-in-class portfolio and our ability to generate reliable, strong same-property NOI growth. For the year, Sun's core FFO per share of $7.10 was in line with our expectations. Same-property NOI increased 7.3% compared to last year, surpassing the high end of guidance. Our operational strength highlights the enduring robust demand and limited supply fundamentals of our portfolio, which supports continued strong revenue growth complemented by diligent expense management. For the fourth quarter, total same-property NOI increased 9.6% compared to the same period in 2022. The outperformance was driven by higher rental revenues from MH and Marinas and lower expense growth across all segments. For the quarter and year, MH same-property NOI increased by 8.6% and 6.8% and RV same-property NOI increased 9.3% and 4.8%. Same-property occupancy in MH and RV increased 230 basis points during 2023 as compared to 2022. The increase was largely driven by transient to annual RV site conversions of more than 2,100 sites. Since the start of 2020 when we began to strategically focus on transient to annual RV site conversions, we have completed approximately 6,900 conversions and have increased the number of annual sites by 24%. Within our Marina same-property portfolio, the continued strong demand for wet slip and dry storage spaces led to another positive quarter and year with a 12.5% increase in NOI for the quarter and an 11.7% increase for the year. In the UK the real property NOI of $66.7 million for the year was in line with guidance, demonstrating the strong value proposition our Holiday Parks represent. The value of owning a holiday home in Park Holidays property is exhibited by the average resident tenure increasing to approximately eight years. Demand for UK home sales showed signs of stabilizing during the second half of the year. UK home sales and margins were in line with our guidance, which reflected economic headwinds facing UK consumers, including higher inflation and interest rates. We anticipate a continuation of current volume and margin trends. Based on the macroeconomic dynamics in the UK, we have recognized total noncash impairments of approximately $370 million related to the goodwill, associated with the Park Holidays platform acquisition. Despite of our year-end audit process, it was determined that the impairments should have been recognized in earlier periods, resulting in a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. These impairments, which are now recognized at March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2023, reduced balance sheet goodwill and GAAP net income. They are noncash and there is no impact on revenues or FFO for operational metrics. From Park Holidays and as previously disclosed in late December, we obtained tied-up a three real estate assets securing the UK note. Additionally, we've recently completed the receivership and disposition processes related to the manufacturing businesses that represented the remaining collateral on UK note. As we previously stated, because we did not wish to operate the manufacturing businesses, we moved expeditiously to dispose of them. As of this month, the UK note has been completely resolved. At the end of the year, we reclassified Sandy Bay, a high-quality MH community that's held for investment. Sandy Bay, along with one operating property and three development parcels that were not part of the original Park Holidays acquisition, are now being operated by the Park Holidays team. We continue to seek to maximize value related to these assets. We are excited about the prospects awaiting us in 2024 and beyond. Our primary goal remains simplifying our operations, while positioning Sun for steady earnings growth. Achieving this involves maintaining focus on our best-in-class portfolio and operating team, which have consistently delivered strong same-property NOI growth. As detailed in our earnings press release, we sold our shares in Ingenia, monetized the portfolio of MH consumer loans, divested our interest in Campspot and meaningfully reduced the number of properties owned in joint ventures. During 2024, we intend to focus on capital recycling strategies, including via select asset sales. By remaining highly selective with development projects and acquisitions, we intend to allocate our free cash flow and any additional capital proceeds generated towards deleveraging. As detailed in last night's press release, our Board announced a $0.01 per share increase to our quarterly distribution or $0.04 on an annual basis. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Jerry Ehlinger and Craig Leupold to our Board. We look forward to their contributions and new perspectives. Last, and certainly not least, I would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Fernando, to discuss our results and guidance in more detail. Fernando?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Gary. For the year and the quarter, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share of $7.10 and $1.34 respectively, both of which were in line with guidance. During the year, same-property NOI grew 7.3% versus the prior year, driven by a 6.2% increase in revenue and a 4.2% increase in expenses.  For the quarter, same-property NOI increased 9.6% compared to the prior year due to a 6.3% increase in revenues, driven by strong rental rate increases and occupancy gains. Expenses grew by only 30 basis points in the quarter, led by utilities and supply repair cost management and a onetime benefit from lower real estate taxes. Looking at same property results across each segment, manufactured housing performance was strong. NOI grew 8.6% in the quarter, due to a 7.6% increase in revenues and expense growth of 4.8%. For the year, same-property NOI in manufactured housing increased by 6.8% compared to 2022. Strong revenue growth for the year of 7% was partially offset by a 7.5% growth in expenses. Same-property RV NOI increased 9.3% in the quarter, driven by a 2.1% increase in revenues and a 4.7% reduction in expenses. The expense savings were driven by aligning controllable costs with lower transient revenues especially in supply and repair, utilities and payroll. For the year, same-property RV NOI increased 4.8%. The continued strong volume of transient to annual RV site conversions also supported operational efficiency as annual RV sites typically allow for lower operating expenses. Our same property adjusted occupancy for manufactured housing and RV increased by 230 basis points to 98.9%, reflecting the demand to be a resident in a Sun Community. On the RV front, we have a long runway of transient sites that can be converted to annual over the coming years. The Marina same-property portfolio had another very positive quarter and year with a 12.5% increase in NOI for the quarter and an 11.7% increase for the year. The outperformance was driven by continued strong demand for wet slip and dry storage spaces due to higher boat traffic especially in the Southeast. Strong revenue growth was supported by expense management and real estate tax savings. As discussed earlier, UK real property performance showed strong growth and home sales volumes were in line with guidance. Our property level results were partially offset by higher interest expense G&A and other corporate costs. Regarding new investment activity, during the year we delivered approximately 800 expansion and development sites in North America. To simplify our business and reduce exposure to variable rate debt, in the fourth quarter, we made strong progress towards monetizing assets no longer deemed to be strategic. We materially simplified our Sun NG joint venture, an arrangement entered into in 2018 with Northgate Resorts, an experienced RV owner and operator. We have a successful relationship with them and it helped us achieve our leading position as an owner and operator one of the highest quality RV portfolios in the US. Given our focus on simplifying how we own properties, we sold our majority equity interest in three joint venture properties and acquired their minority interest in 14 joint venture properties so that we now own 100% of them. Notably we believe these 14 properties have a long runway of embedded growth with meaningful opportunity for transient to annual RV site conversions over the coming years, five properties remain in consolidated JVs where we hold approximately 95% ownership interest. During the quarter, we also sold our ownership interest in RezPlot whose Campspot Software is a valuable tool that we continue to use for managing our RV bookings. Given the strong position we helped Campspot achieve over the past several years, it was an opportune time to divest our interest. In total, the Sun NG and RezPlot transaction netted us a minimal positive cash benefit, which was used to pay down debt. During the quarter, we recycled capital from a $53 million portfolio of manufactured housing consumer loans held on our balance sheet and used the net proceeds to pay down debt. As Gary discussed, we completed the receivership process related to the UK note. The three real estate assets are now reflected on our balance sheet as their currently assessed fair market value of $264 million as supported by updated third-party valuations. Now that we own them these assets in Sandy Bay are being managed by the Park Holidays team and all income derived from their operating performance is included in our 2024 guidance. The remaining assets that collateralize the UK now were manufacturing businesses. Disposing of these businesses expeditiously was a key priority. And in mid-February, they were sold for a total of approximately $10.7 million. We have no further legal, financial or other obligations to these businesses. Regarding our balance sheet, at December 31, 2023, the company had approximately $7.8 billion in debt outstanding and our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio was 6.1 times. With respect to capital markets activity in January, we issued $500 million of five-year senior unsecured notes with a 5.5% coupon. We used the majority of the net proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility. Adjusting our year-end debt balances for this new issuance, we reduced our variable rate debt to approximately 10% of total debt. Turning to guidance for 2024. For 2024, we are establishing full year guidance for core FFO per share in the range of $7.04 to $7.24. We are also establishing guidance for first quarter 2024 core FFO per share in the range of $1.14 to $1.19. For 2024, 95% of our properties are included in the same property pool including Park Holidays. In North America, at the midpoint, we expect same-property NOI growth of 6.5% for manufactured housing, 2.8% from RVs and 6.8% from Marinas to generate total same-property NOI growth of 5.6% for the year. In the UK, we forecast real property operations will generate same-property NOI growth of 1.3% to 3.3% for the year. Our outlook for same-property NOI is anchored on solid expected rental rate growth, and we are confirming the average rental rate guidance provided in October of a 5.4% increase for manufactured housing in North America, 6.5% for RV, 5.6% for Marinas and 7.1% for manufactured housing in the UK. For home sales in North America, our guidance assumes an FFO contribution from $14.4 million to $15.9 million in 2024. The in the UK, our 2024 guidance assumes an FFO contribution from home sales of $62.3 million to $69.9 million, reflecting home sales volume of 2,750 homes at the midpoint. At the midpoint, our guidance assumes we increase revenue-producing sites in North America across manufactured housing and RV by 2,600 sites in 2024. For ground-up developments and expansion activity, our 2024 guidance assumes we allocate approximately $115 million to advance or complete projects already in progress. This includes approximately $50 million of spending, related to the redevelopment of our Hurricane Ian impacted properties in Fort Myers. We are not planning to commence any new ground-up developments. And our average expected investment this year would mark a 54% decrease from our development spend in 2023. For the year, we expect G&A expense to run between $262.2 million and $267.4 million, which equates to a 2.7% decrease over 2023 G&A at the midpoint. Adjusting for anticipated add-backs of nonrecurring expenses, we expect G&A to increase 5.3% at the midpoint. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through February 20, but it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please state your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the flow-through of the NOI growth of 6.3% to 7.3% to FFO growth that's flat to up 2%. This seems to be driven by a number of factors. So as you look to evolve the business, how can you drive better flow-through? And then specifically, can you walk through the interest expense guidance. Your debt load in the fourth quarter was $7.8 billion at 4.23% or $330 million annualized. So how do you bridge the gap there to kind of your guidance which is $35 million higher for 2024?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hey, Michael, good morning, this is Fernando. The primary driver for the flow-through to flat to just over 1% growth expected in core FFO per share in 2024 is primarily due to the interest income from the Royale Life note that we will not have in 2024 and have been communicated with the market. That headwind as we step into 2025 will not be there, which will aid in reaccelerating that growth and that flow-through of strong same-property NOI growth expected not just for this year, but for next year as well as you've seen and underwritten for the company for many years. As it relates to interest expense this year, starting the year off with our $500 million bond issuance, we start the year with about 10% of floating rate debt. So, that will be the largest component of contributing to an increase in year-over-year interest expense from 2023 into 2024. Embedded in our guidance is -- are the latest forward curves as it relates to SOFR and SONIA for that floating rate piece of about 10% of our current debt stack. A step-up in interest expense is related to the secured borrowings that are now on our balance sheet from our consumer note sale during the fourth quarter that is -- from an accounting perspective these notes that were sold are still on our balance sheet and are recognized as both an asset and the liability. On the asset side, it's a collateralized receivable. On the liability side it's a secured borrowing. And those amounts offset each other from an income and expense standpoint but that is adding about $5 million of interest expense to the number.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Marina guidance that's still expected to be strong this year. But conversely service, dining, retail, entertainment or F&B is expected to decline 11%. And I thought those two would probably be a little bit more correlated. So, I just wanted to ask you about that.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. So, John transient revenue expectations in total for RV are expected to be down 2.75%. In Marina, we are expecting an increase or underwriting an increase in Marina transient revenue of about 10% for the year. And in the U.K., we are expecting transient revenue to increase just above 2.5% for the year. From an SRD&E perspective and the decline expected underwritten forecasted for this year that is primarily coming from the Marina side where we are forecasting lower boat sales for this year. But you are right that boat's transient revenue is correlated to the SRD&E side overall.\nJohn Kim: Thank you for that. My second question is on your decision to sell Campspot. I know it's not a very big investment for you. I thought it was a pretty interesting prop-type investment. Were you concerned with the optics of being a large RV owner and having ownership of this third-party data? Or was it just simply a distraction and you just wanted to sell at this time?\nGary Shiffman: Hey John, that's a great question. This is Gary. I think that as we'll continue to share over this call and as we have been sharing with our stakeholders over the last few quarters, in this effort to get back to basics and focus on this strong growth in our core businesses and translate that directly to per share growth we're looking to simplify our business to remove complexities both from a modeling standpoint, but also from an investment standpoint so we can redirect any capital that would be required to continue to develop and invest in Campspot and other type of projects like that to the reduction of debt. So this is a decision where we can get the best of both worlds. We can continue using Campspot, which is the really best software that's out there to manage our REIT communities and monetize it and use the monetization to pay down debt.\nJohn Kim: Just to clarify were there any regulatory concerns of investing in Campspot?\nGary Shiffman: None that we are aware of.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking my question. It was a very active quarter and earnings release for the simplification process. So how should we think about what's left to do? You have two new Board members. You have a new investment review committee. When do you think you get to just kind of a clean quarter or a quarter where you're not taking impairments accounting reviews and we can just kind of get back to the fundamentals of the business. So maybe asked another way what do you still have to work through in the simplification process to get to that moment? And when do you think that is?\nGary Shiffman: That is a great question and something we're very eager to share and demonstrate as we move forward in 2024. We previously and even during this call talked about some of those projects. But we are painfully aware and recognize how challenging 2023 was for all of our stakeholders. The headwinds faced by Park Holidays and the difficulties brought on by the UK note restructuring had a meaningful impact on our performance the stock and investors' perceptions of Sun. So what we can share with you the extinguishment of the UK note that included the sale of the manufacturing businesses the transfer of the land parcels on to our balance sheet allows them to move them towards Park Holidays management team where we continue to share are absolutely outstanding. So we'll be able to operate that group of properties and seek to maximize its value. So we'll look to be able to report on that as the year goes forward. There are five properties that they'll be taking over in this process. We talked about Sandy Bay. It is income producing. There is a second one [indiscernible] has a minor amount of income coming through it now and the three other development parcels. So we're eager to get those in the hands. And Park Holidays in fact they are now overseeing it. Park Holidays itself has performed well in a pretty challenging environment. They have been gaining market share overall and increasing their real property NOI. While we're frustrated as everyone is with the added complication of the announced non-cash goodwill impairment here at Sun the impact does not affect any of Park Holidays' historical cash flow or their operating metrics including NOI, core FFO or its future growth prospects. So we're happy to move forward on that. We expect Park Holidays' 2023 performance to really be a baseline for future growth. And as we've reflected in guidance while somewhat flattish, we believe we will continue to see improvement with continued improvements in the macroeconomics in the UK. We've continued to talk about as we reflect towards 2024 guidance the things we're focused on. We've announced the sale of the stake of Ingenia, the Northgate recapitalization which we just shared which really does take a lot of complexity out of the JV and the reporting and leaves us with the best communities that we think we can optimize growth. They're excellent properties. They have a great runway to be able to convert transient to annual, so should be positive as we go forward. Fernando mentioned, reducing our exposure to floating rate debt and continued reduction in transient revenue through a conversion of more stable and predictable annual RV revenue. All these things I think position us going forward to return to the kind of year-over-year translation of core growth into meaningful FFO per share growth. So this is something we're going to have to demonstrate quarter-by-quarter. Our guidance for 2024 does have the headwinds that Fernando shared with regard to the income interest that we don't have starting out the year but it leads to solid growth and solid guidance on all our business platforms and we look to be able to update and share everybody quarter-by-quarter as we continue to make progress on these goals.\nJamie Feldman: Thank you. That's very helpful. If I could just ask one clarification. Just in terms of kind of accounting review impairment risk, I mean what's the latest conversation with the auditors? Is it the kind of clean bill of health going forward? Or is there still stuff under review?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Jamie, with last night's release, we did announce the non-cash impairment to goodwill charges that will be – that will flow through when we file our 10-K but we provided details to it in our supplemental, that totaled $370 million of non-cash goodwill impairment for – cumulatively for the year itself. So there's – nothing else is contemplated as it relates to impairment at this time.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. All right. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nJosh Dennerlein: Hey, guys. Maybe just a follow-up to Jamie's last question. I read the 8-K last night on the material weakness in company's internal controls. I guess just – was it just related to how you guys reviewed goodwill? Or is there anything else you guys want to improve as far as internal controls? Just kind of curious the scope.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure, Josh. A material weakness is a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting, which results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will occur. We identified a material weakness specific to the design of accounting controls over assessing goodwill at Park Holidays. As a result of the material weakness in the design of this control, we failed to take the material goodwill impairment charge at the appropriate quarters. We will now reflect that in our 10-K. We are working on the remediation plan for this control moving forward and we can update the market as we move forward over the course of the next couple of quarters.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. And then Gary, I appreciate your comments on just getting back to the basics focusing on the core growth. I see like you cleaned up the JVs the Cam site. Is there anything larger that you guys are contemplating as far as like shedding asset wise or just simplifying? Any kind of color there? And would that potentially include like an exit from the UK?\nGary Shiffman: So great question, Josh. I think that in general, we have shared our intention to look at certain assets we can define them as non-core or smaller or regionally not located in areas where we have efficiencies. So we will continue on a relatively small magnitude certain dispositions. We mentioned, we have two of them out for sale that we expect to close very shortly. And the magnitude of those is something equal to or less than what we last said, I think in 2014 or 2015, a total of over or up to $300 million. But with no certainty, there's nothing forcing us to sell those assets. And we will manage those as we find interest and determine that we can sell them on a logical and accretive basis. So with regard to those types of dispositions we're focused on that. And we shared that in the market. With regard to the UK, I think that, we've discussed that certainly the macro headwinds have impacted home sales. And at the same time real property contribution has been growing during the current difficult financial environment in the UK and guidance reflects flat but a little bit of growth for 2024. So our goal at this time based on market in the UK and the fact that we have really well-located properties and an excellent management team is managing through these difficult times, that we will continue to operate the platform with maximize growth and value with what we consider a great management team, and make determinations on a quarterly and annual basis, as to best decisions moving forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nSamir Khanal: Hi. Gary and Fernando, I guess just can you expand on the UK home sales a little bit more here? I know when you look at the sales volume, I think you're expecting it to be sort of flat to down, but then, kind of what you alluded to in the prior question. You're saying the contribution will be up. So maybe help us think through that maybe the margins you're assuming for the business. Thanks.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Samir. You're correct. At the high-end of the range, we are expecting flat volume for -- on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint, about a 3.5% decline in volume. On an adjusted basis 2023 UK NOI from home sales margins, were just above $21,000 per home. For 2024, our margin expectations are higher than in 2023, given the contribution to overall margin from home sales at Sandy Bay, which is now as Gary had stated being operated by the Park Holidays team. Given that this community is a year-round primary home community, that typically sees higher home prices and gross NOI dollar margins above $110,000 per home. To frame expectations of volume at Sandy, we are expecting somewhere within 30 to 50 homes sold in that community which is driving overall margin for the year up above the 2023 levels.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. Got it. And if I could just ask one more here on the expense side, I know insurance growth has moderated this year, but expense growth is still expected to be higher than what we were anticipating. Maybe give us color around sort of the components of expenses and kind of what you're --how you're thinking about the various line items? Thanks.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure, Samir. During 2023, we had active cost containment strategies in place mainly across payroll, utilities, supply and repair and advertising that are budgeted to return to normalized -- at the normalized state in 2024. This is leading to that expense growth year-over-year in North America, same property of 8.6% at the midpoint. So certainly in supply and repair, we saw a decrease year-over-year for example in 2023, and we are growing off of that base north of 10%. From an expectation standpoint, we certainly will look to continue managing our costs in response right to any revenues, especially on the RV side. And so that could right, that could change over the course of the year. But those are the primary drivers that are taking, call it, overall expense growth higher than in 2023.\nSamir Khanal: Thank you, Fernando.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.\nKeegan Carl: Yes. Thanks for the time guys. So going to take a more bigger picture approach here. I guess, first, maybe on Marinas. Gary, I mean, how should we think about pricing power going forward? And then, I guess, specifically, where are you seeing your waiting list demands at today? And how does that compare to last year?\nGary Shiffman: Good questions, Keegan. Obviously, as we've stated in our remarks that we continue to see strong demand for wet slip and dry storage. At over 80% of the Marina portfolio, we're experiencing continued weight lift of at least one size. So there's still continuing demand. We've had over 7% and over 11% same-property growth in 2022 and 2023. And as we've guided in 2024, we still expect continued growth. I think that we look at everything in our core businesses as a marathon. As we've shared even with the headwinds that we had in 2023, obviously, we're all aware of how the portfolios performed. So in thinking through rental increases, expense control, CapEx investment for the long-term, our expectation is that for all of our businesses, including Marinas, we look forward to continued steady growth, the type of core growth that we've exhibited and seen throughout Sun's ownership of these platforms. So and we feel very good going forward. And we're laser-focused on resolving the things that we want to resolve to be able to translate that growth to our stakeholders going forward.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. That's really helpful. And then, I guess, just shifting to the other big picture theme here on Park Holidays. I know we spent a lot of time on the call on it. But with the impairment behind you, I guess, I'm trying to get more clarity on what the outlook is for the business going forward. And I guess I'm looking more from, what are your plans for this platform, right? If you're gaining market share, if the business delevers and the macro environment improves, and in theory, this business outgrows your portfolio average, should we expect you to grow your exposure to this platform over time? And if not, why?\nGary Shiffman: I can say at this time, we're very comfortable with where our exposure is. I go back to the same thing. The reasons for the investment there were to gain continued exposure to manufactured housing revenue, which is highly sticky, highly valued. It had a disproportionate fair to home sale, disproportionate share of contribution from home sales. We've committed to working through that on a five to seven-year basis. We're over two years into that right now, and we're continuing to see the benefit where we reduce home sales margin, whether intentional or not, and seek to increase occupancy and contribution through real property rent and lease payments, if you will. That's all going very well. Certainly, as we've shared, the disproportionate attention and focus in the downward guidance we experienced in 2023 are all areas that we are focused on. And as we continue to focus in 2024 to grow the company, to create value, to take on the assets that they're now operating and to create value from them, we'll make a determination. There are no determinations made at this time. But as always, all options are on the table, and we're excited for the management team to turn in the best results to take in 2024.\nFernando Castro-Caratini : And Keegan, if I can add, similar to our non-strategic asset capital recycling program here in the US, we are under those plans in the UK as well, where we can potentially monetize a few assets from the portfolio over the course of this year.\nKeegan Carl: Great. Thanks for the time guys.\nGary Shiffman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citibank. Please state your question.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. It's Nick here with Eric. Gary, at the end of last week, you obviously announced the cooperation agreement and the standstill on the two new Board appointees but also the Capital Allocation Committee. So, I was hoping if you could dive into that a bit in terms of what the Capital Allocation Committee will be doing? How it's different than what you were doing previously and kind of what additional rigor you think it brings to your investment decisions?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. Thanks Eric. I think that we're very pleased with the fact that the Board has established the Capital Allocation Committee to review the company's use and investment of capital and to make recommendations to the full Board. It's a more formalized process what has always taken place at a Board level. We're pleased to have Craig Leupold serve on that Capital Allocation Committee, and we will have two independent Board members on that committee as well. And we have formulated and begun to formulate a charter for that. So we look forward to their contribution. And we think it will be a continued benefit as we move forward and strengthen the Board and the company in the future.\nEric Wolfe: Hey. It's Eric here. I guess since everyone's breaking the rule, so just a quick one on your CapEx guidance. I was just curious if you can maybe give us a sense for what's included in terms of recurring nonrecurring CapEx as well as free cash flow? And I think you mentioned that you might have some free cash flow that would be used to pay down debt but trying to understand how then you would sort of get to that $360 million of interest expense that's in your guidance, because the fourth quarter run rate would suggest something that's a bit lower. I understand the $5 million of secured borrowing impact it still seems like there's another call it $10 million or so more get to your guidance. Thanks.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Eric, on the interest expense quickly right there were increases to underlying rates over the course of 2023. So, there is a full year of that impact at the higher rates than where they started in 2023, which should help bridge that gap. As it relates to recurring capital expenditures for our business, we are expecting $120 million, $125 million of recurring CapEx across our platform in total currently, and this is something that we are continuing to work through. But we are underwriting and all other categories, right? We've mentioned expansion ground-up development and redevelopment, but spending over 50% less in CapEx in the other categories than we did in 2023.\nEric Wolfe: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please state your question.\nWes Golladay: Hey, everyone. If I could just follow-up on the interest expense question, what do you think for capitalized interest this year?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Given that we are spending less on the ground-up development and expansion side, there is a production year-over-year in capitalized interest. Wes, let me get back to you with that exact amount. I don't have it in front of me.\nWes Golladay: Sounds good. Okay. And then can you talk about what drove the reclassification of the indirect expenses this quarter?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. So Wes, this is in an effort to better refine the indirect expenses to their revenue drivers. This is no different. If you'll recall when the Marina portfolio joined the same-property pool we did have a re-class exercise between real property and SRD&E mainly. As the Park Holidays portfolio joined our same-property pool, we did undertake the same exercise in aligning and -- best aligning those indirect expenses to the revenue drivers. While there are -- there is some impact across other categories, the primary ones are in home sales and SRD&E. The indirect expenses being reallocated or payroll -- shared payroll benefits, and taxes, advertising, utilities, credit card processing fees that are now best going to those revenue drivers themselves.\nWes Golladay: Okay. Thank you very much,\nFernando Castro-Caratini: And there's no impact of overall NOI productivity from the properties themselves.\nWes Golladay: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital. Please state your question.\nBrad Heffern: Hi, everybody. Thanks. So for the properties received in the UK receivership process, how far away are those from being meaningful earnings contributors? And do you plan to market those or to hold them?\nGary Shiffman: I think it's an excellent question again. As it relates to the five, what we call non-Park Holidays UK assets that are now going to be managed by Park Holidays, they consist of two operating assets, Brad, and three development parcels, four of which were related to the UK loan. So now that we have full ownership of them and operational control, we're able to really assess best how to move forward with them and how to maximize value with them. So I think we're going to be able to share that with you over the next couple of quarters. But there are only two of the properties that are actually contributing to guidance this coming year, and the other three will have to determine what next steps will be with the undeveloped properties.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: And Brad, to frame roughly on the UK home sales NOI, Sandy is expected to contribute about 10% of our -- of the overall NOI contribution for the year. The other asset that Gary mentioned, [indiscernible] has a nominal contribution to real property, about $1 million.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you for that. And then for the Arizona and Florida communities that you're selling, can you give the details of what those assets are and also the expected cap rate?\nGary Shiffman: I'm going to suggest Fernando might have the exact number of the sale. But as we discussed, we are looking at the disposition of properties on an accretive basis. And as we are discussing with interested parties, those properties' cap rates come into play. And at an appropriate time in the future where we've completed the transactions, we'll be able to share the specifics of the cap rates with you.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please state your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for the time. I have a follow-up question on the disposition program in the US Gary, you guys have been talking about the capital recycling since, I think, last September. So curious -- it feels like it's taking longer than expected. So what has changed in terms of the volume you're looking to sell? And how has pricing changed as you brought these assets to market? How your pricing expectations changed versus the fall?\nGary Shiffman: John, thanks for the question. I think that when we've talked about capital recycling, it's included both the properties as well as some of the other things that we've shared with you selling our position in Ingenia the balance sheet notes, unwinding the complexity in our very large JV and other things that we continue to look at of which dispositions is just one part of. Since we've discussed that, as you referenced, we've spent a good deal of time, assessing the portfolio, determining which assets might be candidates, running all the pre-work and the preparation to be able to market some of those properties, the fruit of which is just coming to bear for the first time this week. It has been an ongoing process and we hope to be able to continue to share more on those dispositions, as we can do so. As we shared before, we don't typically announce the dispositions or capital market impacts until they're actually close. So I think that, as far as how we're viewing things, they're pretty similar to how we have in the past. Certainly, interest rates have impacted both pricing and how we look at the accretiveness of the transactions. And we feel comfortable, with what we're looking at near-term. And as we negotiate through those, we look forward to being able to share them with you. But it's just a little bit too early John, to know exactly how the market is going to price everything. But moving forward, we're -- I could say, we're within 25 to 75 basis points of the areas that we expected to be in.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Hau with Truist Securities. Please state your question.\nQ – Anthony Hau: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you guys provide any color on the transaction market for Holiday Parks? What EBITDA multiple and cap rates for these assets trading at today compared to three years ago?\nGary Shiffman: Hi, Anthony it's Gary. I guess I suggest overall, that just aren't very many comps out there. Obviously, as it goes into our recognition of valuation of the Park Holidays platform, as we think about opportunities to acquire or dispose of assets, we're very, very focused on keeping a pulse in the market there. And the fact of the matter is, that while we believe firmly, Park Holidays is gaining market share from other big operators out there who are struggling both through the macroeconomics and some internal issues that are being made aware at those companies. We grabbed that market share. We are working through creating operational value through home sales and through occupancy, and we'll have to continue to study and share with you what we're seeing with valuation in the market. But as of right now, there's just nothing to turn to. And I'll also turn it over to the US as well. When we look at the limited amount of transactions going on in manufactured housing in particular in the US, there just isn't a lot to reference out there as indicative cap rates or indicative pricing. So, we continue to watch it very thoughtfully.\nQ – Anthony Hau: Thanks a lot. If I can just squeeze a quick one, and another one in. Fernando, I saw that same-properties revenue for UK is 200 bps lower than the average rental rate increase. Just curious like what's the difference? Is it because the transient side is a little bit weaker? Or is it because of occupancy?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure Anthony, their transient growth expected in the UK for this year is at about 250 basis points of growth year-over-year. So that certainly is a driver, of revenue being -- revenue growth being less than the rental increase of north of 7%. And then, it would be timing of nonrenewals to when we are expecting the sales and bringing in new homeowners. So, there is right as you know, our rental increases go out in the fall. We already have over a 90% renewal for the portfolio, but it essentially is timing differences from an occupancy perspective.\nAnthony Hau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please state your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. I had a question on the RV NOI growth guidance of 2.1% to 2.5%, but that seemed a bit light given the strong kind of annual growth rate. So, can you talk about your changing demand assumptions and also your assumptions for RV expense growth this year?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: So Anthony, thank you for the question. On the revenue side, prior we are expecting transient revenue growth for the portfolio to be at -- to be down about 2% -- 2.75% for the year and that is what we are currently underwriting. And we are -- we do have higher expenses expected for the portfolio this year. And again, it's returning to more normal conditions. Last year, we did put in a number of active cost containment strategies across payroll utilities and supply and repair. And budgeting, forecasting for those to be at more normal levels over the course of 2024 is driving expense increase year-over-year of just under 10% for the year. That's -- those are the two drivers where our NOI growth at the midpoint is expected at 2.8%. We are forecasting another very strong year of conversions for our portfolio that will continue to drive operational efficiencies over the course of the next couple of years.\nAnthony Powell: Right. So, is that transient revenue demand assumptions all driven by site conversions? Or is that also assuming it's weaker against the visitation weaker pricing?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Anthony, I'm sorry. Can you ask the question as it cut in and out?\nAnthony Powell: Yes, sorry. On the transient revenue decline assumption, is that driven all by site conversions? Or is that also driven by visitation or other assumptions that are driving that decline?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: That is primarily driven by the site conversions that occurred over the course of last year and continued conversions into this year. Given that we converted last year over 6% of our sites, we are underwriting strong rate growth on the transient side. That is -- that gets you to the down year-over-year about 2.75% currently.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nGary Shiffman: We thank everybody for participating in the conference call. And we really do look forward to sharing with you our first quarter results and the rest results as they are able to be shared throughout the year. Thank you, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's call. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss fourth quarter and full year results for 2023 and our guidance for 2024. 2023 results demonstrated the resiliency of our best-in-class portfolio and our ability to generate reliable, strong same-property NOI growth. For the year, Sun's core FFO per share of $7.10 was in line with our expectations. Same-property NOI increased 7.3% compared to last year, surpassing the high end of guidance. Our operational strength highlights the enduring robust demand and limited supply fundamentals of our portfolio, which supports continued strong revenue growth complemented by diligent expense management. For the fourth quarter, total same-property NOI increased 9.6% compared to the same period in 2022. The outperformance was driven by higher rental revenues from MH and Marinas and lower expense growth across all segments. For the quarter and year, MH same-property NOI increased by 8.6% and 6.8% and RV same-property NOI increased 9.3% and 4.8%. Same-property occupancy in MH and RV increased 230 basis points during 2023 as compared to 2022. The increase was largely driven by transient to annual RV site conversions of more than 2,100 sites. Since the start of 2020 when we began to strategically focus on transient to annual RV site conversions, we have completed approximately 6,900 conversions and have increased the number of annual sites by 24%. Within our Marina same-property portfolio, the continued strong demand for wet slip and dry storage spaces led to another positive quarter and year with a 12.5% increase in NOI for the quarter and an 11.7% increase for the year. In the UK the real property NOI of $66.7 million for the year was in line with guidance, demonstrating the strong value proposition our Holiday Parks represent. The value of owning a holiday home in Park Holidays property is exhibited by the average resident tenure increasing to approximately eight years. Demand for UK home sales showed signs of stabilizing during the second half of the year. UK home sales and margins were in line with our guidance, which reflected economic headwinds facing UK consumers, including higher inflation and interest rates. We anticipate a continuation of current volume and margin trends. Based on the macroeconomic dynamics in the UK, we have recognized total noncash impairments of approximately $370 million related to the goodwill, associated with the Park Holidays platform acquisition. Despite of our year-end audit process, it was determined that the impairments should have been recognized in earlier periods, resulting in a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. These impairments, which are now recognized at March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2023, reduced balance sheet goodwill and GAAP net income. They are noncash and there is no impact on revenues or FFO for operational metrics. From Park Holidays and as previously disclosed in late December, we obtained tied-up a three real estate assets securing the UK note. Additionally, we've recently completed the receivership and disposition processes related to the manufacturing businesses that represented the remaining collateral on UK note. As we previously stated, because we did not wish to operate the manufacturing businesses, we moved expeditiously to dispose of them. As of this month, the UK note has been completely resolved. At the end of the year, we reclassified Sandy Bay, a high-quality MH community that's held for investment. Sandy Bay, along with one operating property and three development parcels that were not part of the original Park Holidays acquisition, are now being operated by the Park Holidays team. We continue to seek to maximize value related to these assets. We are excited about the prospects awaiting us in 2024 and beyond. Our primary goal remains simplifying our operations, while positioning Sun for steady earnings growth. Achieving this involves maintaining focus on our best-in-class portfolio and operating team, which have consistently delivered strong same-property NOI growth. As detailed in our earnings press release, we sold our shares in Ingenia, monetized the portfolio of MH consumer loans, divested our interest in Campspot and meaningfully reduced the number of properties owned in joint ventures. During 2024, we intend to focus on capital recycling strategies, including via select asset sales. By remaining highly selective with development projects and acquisitions, we intend to allocate our free cash flow and any additional capital proceeds generated towards deleveraging. As detailed in last night's press release, our Board announced a $0.01 per share increase to our quarterly distribution or $0.04 on an annual basis. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Jerry Ehlinger and Craig Leupold to our Board. We look forward to their contributions and new perspectives. Last, and certainly not least, I would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Fernando, to discuss our results and guidance in more detail. Fernando? Hey John, that's a great question. This is Gary. I think that as we'll continue to share over this call and as we have been sharing with our stakeholders over the last few quarters, in this effort to get back to basics and focus on this strong growth in our core businesses and translate that directly to per share growth we're looking to simplify our business to remove complexities both from a modeling standpoint, but also from an investment standpoint so we can redirect any capital that would be required to continue to develop and invest in Campspot and other type of projects like that to the reduction of debt. So this is a decision where we can get the best of both worlds. We can continue using Campspot, which is the really best software that's out there to manage our REIT communities and monetize it and use the monetization to pay down debt. None that we are aware of. That is a great question and something we're very eager to share and demonstrate as we move forward in 2024. We previously and even during this call talked about some of those projects. But we are painfully aware and recognize how challenging 2023 was for all of our stakeholders. The headwinds faced by Park Holidays and the difficulties brought on by the UK note restructuring had a meaningful impact on our performance the stock and investors' perceptions of Sun. So what we can share with you the extinguishment of the UK note that included the sale of the manufacturing businesses the transfer of the land parcels on to our balance sheet allows them to move them towards Park Holidays management team where we continue to share are absolutely outstanding. So we'll be able to operate that group of properties and seek to maximize its value. So we'll look to be able to report on that as the year goes forward. There are five properties that they'll be taking over in this process. We talked about Sandy Bay. It is income producing. There is a second one [indiscernible] has a minor amount of income coming through it now and the three other development parcels. So we're eager to get those in the hands. And Park Holidays in fact they are now overseeing it. Park Holidays itself has performed well in a pretty challenging environment. They have been gaining market share overall and increasing their real property NOI. While we're frustrated as everyone is with the added complication of the announced non-cash goodwill impairment here at Sun the impact does not affect any of Park Holidays' historical cash flow or their operating metrics including NOI, core FFO or its future growth prospects. So we're happy to move forward on that. We expect Park Holidays' 2023 performance to really be a baseline for future growth. And as we've reflected in guidance while somewhat flattish, we believe we will continue to see improvement with continued improvements in the macroeconomics in the UK. We've continued to talk about as we reflect towards 2024 guidance the things we're focused on. We've announced the sale of the stake of Ingenia, the Northgate recapitalization which we just shared which really does take a lot of complexity out of the JV and the reporting and leaves us with the best communities that we think we can optimize growth. They're excellent properties. They have a great runway to be able to convert transient to annual, so should be positive as we go forward. Fernando mentioned, reducing our exposure to floating rate debt and continued reduction in transient revenue through a conversion of more stable and predictable annual RV revenue. All these things I think position us going forward to return to the kind of year-over-year translation of core growth into meaningful FFO per share growth. So this is something we're going to have to demonstrate quarter-by-quarter. Our guidance for 2024 does have the headwinds that Fernando shared with regard to the income interest that we don't have starting out the year but it leads to solid growth and solid guidance on all our business platforms and we look to be able to update and share everybody quarter-by-quarter as we continue to make progress on these goals. So great question, Josh. I think that in general, we have shared our intention to look at certain assets we can define them as non-core or smaller or regionally not located in areas where we have efficiencies. So we will continue on a relatively small magnitude certain dispositions. We mentioned, we have two of them out for sale that we expect to close very shortly. And the magnitude of those is something equal to or less than what we last said, I think in 2014 or 2015, a total of over or up to $300 million. But with no certainty, there's nothing forcing us to sell those assets. And we will manage those as we find interest and determine that we can sell them on a logical and accretive basis. So with regard to those types of dispositions we're focused on that. And we shared that in the market. With regard to the UK, I think that, we've discussed that certainly the macro headwinds have impacted home sales. And at the same time real property contribution has been growing during the current difficult financial environment in the UK and guidance reflects flat but a little bit of growth for 2024. So our goal at this time based on market in the UK and the fact that we have really well-located properties and an excellent management team is managing through these difficult times, that we will continue to operate the platform with maximize growth and value with what we consider a great management team, and make determinations on a quarterly and annual basis, as to best decisions moving forward. Good questions, Keegan. Obviously, as we've stated in our remarks that we continue to see strong demand for wet slip and dry storage. At over 80% of the Marina portfolio, we're experiencing continued weight lift of at least one size. So there's still continuing demand. We've had over 7% and over 11% same-property growth in 2022 and 2023. And as we've guided in 2024, we still expect continued growth. I think that we look at everything in our core businesses as a marathon. As we've shared even with the headwinds that we had in 2023, obviously, we're all aware of how the portfolios performed. So in thinking through rental increases, expense control, CapEx investment for the long-term, our expectation is that for all of our businesses, including Marinas, we look forward to continued steady growth, the type of core growth that we've exhibited and seen throughout Sun's ownership of these platforms. So and we feel very good going forward. And we're laser-focused on resolving the things that we want to resolve to be able to translate that growth to our stakeholders going forward. I can say at this time, we're very comfortable with where our exposure is. I go back to the same thing. The reasons for the investment there were to gain continued exposure to manufactured housing revenue, which is highly sticky, highly valued. It had a disproportionate fair to home sale, disproportionate share of contribution from home sales. We've committed to working through that on a five to seven-year basis. We're over two years into that right now, and we're continuing to see the benefit where we reduce home sales margin, whether intentional or not, and seek to increase occupancy and contribution through real property rent and lease payments, if you will. That's all going very well. Certainly, as we've shared, the disproportionate attention and focus in the downward guidance we experienced in 2023 are all areas that we are focused on. And as we continue to focus in 2024 to grow the company, to create value, to take on the assets that they're now operating and to create value from them, we'll make a determination. There are no determinations made at this time. But as always, all options are on the table, and we're excited for the management team to turn in the best results to take in 2024. Thank you. Yes. Thanks Eric. I think that we're very pleased with the fact that the Board has established the Capital Allocation Committee to review the company's use and investment of capital and to make recommendations to the full Board. It's a more formalized process what has always taken place at a Board level. We're pleased to have Craig Leupold serve on that Capital Allocation Committee, and we will have two independent Board members on that committee as well. And we have formulated and begun to formulate a charter for that. So we look forward to their contribution. And we think it will be a continued benefit as we move forward and strengthen the Board and the company in the future. I think it's an excellent question again. As it relates to the five, what we call non-Park Holidays UK assets that are now going to be managed by Park Holidays, they consist of two operating assets, Brad, and three development parcels, four of which were related to the UK loan. So now that we have full ownership of them and operational control, we're able to really assess best how to move forward with them and how to maximize value with them. So I think we're going to be able to share that with you over the next couple of quarters. But there are only two of the properties that are actually contributing to guidance this coming year, and the other three will have to determine what next steps will be with the undeveloped properties. I'm going to suggest Fernando might have the exact number of the sale. But as we discussed, we are looking at the disposition of properties on an accretive basis. And as we are discussing with interested parties, those properties' cap rates come into play. And at an appropriate time in the future where we've completed the transactions, we'll be able to share the specifics of the cap rates with you. John, thanks for the question. I think that when we've talked about capital recycling, it's included both the properties as well as some of the other things that we've shared with you selling our position in Ingenia the balance sheet notes, unwinding the complexity in our very large JV and other things that we continue to look at of which dispositions is just one part of. Since we've discussed that, as you referenced, we've spent a good deal of time, assessing the portfolio, determining which assets might be candidates, running all the pre-work and the preparation to be able to market some of those properties, the fruit of which is just coming to bear for the first time this week. It has been an ongoing process and we hope to be able to continue to share more on those dispositions, as we can do so. As we shared before, we don't typically announce the dispositions or capital market impacts until they're actually close. So I think that, as far as how we're viewing things, they're pretty similar to how we have in the past. Certainly, interest rates have impacted both pricing and how we look at the accretiveness of the transactions. And we feel comfortable, with what we're looking at near-term. And as we negotiate through those, we look forward to being able to share them with you. But it's just a little bit too early John, to know exactly how the market is going to price everything. But moving forward, we're -- I could say, we're within 25 to 75 basis points of the areas that we expected to be in. Hi, Anthony it's Gary. I guess I suggest overall, that just aren't very many comps out there. Obviously, as it goes into our recognition of valuation of the Park Holidays platform, as we think about opportunities to acquire or dispose of assets, we're very, very focused on keeping a pulse in the market there. And the fact of the matter is, that while we believe firmly, Park Holidays is gaining market share from other big operators out there who are struggling both through the macroeconomics and some internal issues that are being made aware at those companies.

But as of right now, there's just nothing to turn to. And I'll also turn it over to the US as well. When we look at the limited amount of transactions going on in manufactured housing in particular in the US, there just isn't a lot to reference out there as indicative cap rates or indicative pricing. So, we continue to watch it very thoughtfully.\nQ – Anthony Hau: Thanks a lot. If I can just squeeze a quick one, and another one in. Fernando, I saw that same-properties revenue for UK is 200 bps lower than the average rental rate increase. Just curious like what's the difference? Is it because the transient side is a little bit weaker? Or is it because of occupancy? We thank everybody for participating in the conference call. And we really do look forward to sharing with you our first quarter results and the rest results as they are able to be shared throughout the year. Thank you, operator."

            "name": "Fernando Castro-Caratini",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. For the year and the quarter, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share of $7.10 and $1.34 respectively, both of which were in line with guidance. During the year, same-property NOI grew 7.3% versus the prior year, driven by a 6.2% increase in revenue and a 4.2% increase in expenses.  For the quarter, same-property NOI increased 9.6% compared to the prior year due to a 6.3% increase in revenues, driven by strong rental rate increases and occupancy gains. Expenses grew by only 30 basis points in the quarter, led by utilities and supply repair cost management and a onetime benefit from lower real estate taxes. Looking at same property results across each segment, manufactured housing performance was strong. NOI grew 8.6% in the quarter, due to a 7.6% increase in revenues and expense growth of 4.8%. For the year, same-property NOI in manufactured housing increased by 6.8% compared to 2022. Strong revenue growth for the year of 7% was partially offset by a 7.5% growth in expenses. Same-property RV NOI increased 9.3% in the quarter, driven by a 2.1% increase in revenues and a 4.7% reduction in expenses. The expense savings were driven by aligning controllable costs with lower transient revenues especially in supply and repair, utilities and payroll. For the year, same-property RV NOI increased 4.8%. The continued strong volume of transient to annual RV site conversions also supported operational efficiency as annual RV sites typically allow for lower operating expenses. Our same property adjusted occupancy for manufactured housing and RV increased by 230 basis points to 98.9%, reflecting the demand to be a resident in a Sun Community. On the RV front, we have a long runway of transient sites that can be converted to annual over the coming years. The Marina same-property portfolio had another very positive quarter and year with a 12.5% increase in NOI for the quarter and an 11.7% increase for the year. The outperformance was driven by continued strong demand for wet slip and dry storage spaces due to higher boat traffic especially in the Southeast. Strong revenue growth was supported by expense management and real estate tax savings. As discussed earlier, UK real property performance showed strong growth and home sales volumes were in line with guidance. Our property level results were partially offset by higher interest expense G&A and other corporate costs. Regarding new investment activity, during the year we delivered approximately 800 expansion and development sites in North America. To simplify our business and reduce exposure to variable rate debt, in the fourth quarter, we made strong progress towards monetizing assets no longer deemed to be strategic. We materially simplified our Sun NG joint venture, an arrangement entered into in 2018 with Northgate Resorts, an experienced RV owner and operator. We have a successful relationship with them and it helped us achieve our leading position as an owner and operator one of the highest quality RV portfolios in the US. Given our focus on simplifying how we own properties, we sold our majority equity interest in three joint venture properties and acquired their minority interest in 14 joint venture properties so that we now own 100% of them. Notably we believe these 14 properties have a long runway of embedded growth with meaningful opportunity for transient to annual RV site conversions over the coming years, five properties remain in consolidated JVs where we hold approximately 95% ownership interest. During the quarter, we also sold our ownership interest in RezPlot whose Campspot Software is a valuable tool that we continue to use for managing our RV bookings. Given the strong position we helped Campspot achieve over the past several years, it was an opportune time to divest our interest. In total, the Sun NG and RezPlot transaction netted us a minimal positive cash benefit, which was used to pay down debt. During the quarter, we recycled capital from a $53 million portfolio of manufactured housing consumer loans held on our balance sheet and used the net proceeds to pay down debt. As Gary discussed, we completed the receivership process related to the UK note. The three real estate assets are now reflected on our balance sheet as their currently assessed fair market value of $264 million as supported by updated third-party valuations. Now that we own them these assets in Sandy Bay are being managed by the Park Holidays team and all income derived from their operating performance is included in our 2024 guidance. The remaining assets that collateralize the UK now were manufacturing businesses. Disposing of these businesses expeditiously was a key priority. And in mid-February, they were sold for a total of approximately $10.7 million. We have no further legal, financial or other obligations to these businesses. Regarding our balance sheet, at December 31, 2023, the company had approximately $7.8 billion in debt outstanding and our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio was 6.1 times. With respect to capital markets activity in January, we issued $500 million of five-year senior unsecured notes with a 5.5% coupon. We used the majority of the net proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility. Adjusting our year-end debt balances for this new issuance, we reduced our variable rate debt to approximately 10% of total debt. Turning to guidance for 2024. For 2024, we are establishing full year guidance for core FFO per share in the range of $7.04 to $7.24. We are also establishing guidance for first quarter 2024 core FFO per share in the range of $1.14 to $1.19. For 2024, 95% of our properties are included in the same property pool including Park Holidays. In North America, at the midpoint, we expect same-property NOI growth of 6.5% for manufactured housing, 2.8% from RVs and 6.8% from Marinas to generate total same-property NOI growth of 5.6% for the year. In the UK, we forecast real property operations will generate same-property NOI growth of 1.3% to 3.3% for the year. Our outlook for same-property NOI is anchored on solid expected rental rate growth, and we are confirming the average rental rate guidance provided in October of a 5.4% increase for manufactured housing in North America, 6.5% for RV, 5.6% for Marinas and 7.1% for manufactured housing in the UK. For home sales in North America, our guidance assumes an FFO contribution from $14.4 million to $15.9 million in 2024. The in the UK, our 2024 guidance assumes an FFO contribution from home sales of $62.3 million to $69.9 million, reflecting home sales volume of 2,750 homes at the midpoint. At the midpoint, our guidance assumes we increase revenue-producing sites in North America across manufactured housing and RV by 2,600 sites in 2024. For ground-up developments and expansion activity, our 2024 guidance assumes we allocate approximately $115 million to advance or complete projects already in progress. This includes approximately $50 million of spending, related to the redevelopment of our Hurricane Ian impacted properties in Fort Myers. We are not planning to commence any new ground-up developments. And our average expected investment this year would mark a 54% decrease from our development spend in 2023. For the year, we expect G&A expense to run between $262.2 million and $267.4 million, which equates to a 2.7% decrease over 2023 G&A at the midpoint. Adjusting for anticipated add-backs of nonrecurring expenses, we expect G&A to increase 5.3% at the midpoint. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through February 20, but it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator? Hey, Michael, good morning, this is Fernando. The primary driver for the flow-through to flat to just over 1% growth expected in core FFO per share in 2024 is primarily due to the interest income from the Royale Life note that we will not have in 2024 and have been communicated with the market. That headwind as we step into 2025 will not be there, which will aid in reaccelerating that growth and that flow-through of strong same-property NOI growth expected not just for this year, but for next year as well as you've seen and underwritten for the company for many years. As it relates to interest expense this year, starting the year off with our $500 million bond issuance, we start the year with about 10% of floating rate debt. So, that will be the largest component of contributing to an increase in year-over-year interest expense from 2023 into 2024. Embedded in our guidance is -- are the latest forward curves as it relates to SOFR and SONIA for that floating rate piece of about 10% of our current debt stack. A step-up in interest expense is related to the secured borrowings that are now on our balance sheet from our consumer note sale during the fourth quarter that is -- from an accounting perspective these notes that were sold are still on our balance sheet and are recognized as both an asset and the liability. On the asset side, it's a collateralized receivable. On the liability side it's a secured borrowing. And those amounts offset each other from an income and expense standpoint but that is adding about $5 million of interest expense to the number. Sure. So, John transient revenue expectations in total for RV are expected to be down 2.75%. In Marina, we are expecting an increase or underwriting an increase in Marina transient revenue of about 10% for the year. And in the U.K., we are expecting transient revenue to increase just above 2.5% for the year. From an SRD&E perspective and the decline expected underwritten forecasted for this year that is primarily coming from the Marina side where we are forecasting lower boat sales for this year. But you are right that boat's transient revenue is correlated to the SRD&E side overall. Jamie, with last night's release, we did announce the non-cash impairment to goodwill charges that will be – that will flow through when we file our 10-K but we provided details to it in our supplemental, that totaled $370 million of non-cash goodwill impairment for – cumulatively for the year itself. So there's – nothing else is contemplated as it relates to impairment at this time. Sure, Josh. A material weakness is a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting, which results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will occur. We identified a material weakness specific to the design of accounting controls over assessing goodwill at Park Holidays. As a result of the material weakness in the design of this control, we failed to take the material goodwill impairment charge at the appropriate quarters. We will now reflect that in our 10-K. We are working on the remediation plan for this control moving forward and we can update the market as we move forward over the course of the next couple of quarters. Thank you, Samir. You're correct. At the high-end of the range, we are expecting flat volume for -- on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint, about a 3.5% decline in volume. On an adjusted basis 2023 UK NOI from home sales margins, were just above $21,000 per home. For 2024, our margin expectations are higher than in 2023, given the contribution to overall margin from home sales at Sandy Bay, which is now as Gary had stated being operated by the Park Holidays team. Given that this community is a year-round primary home community, that typically sees higher home prices and gross NOI dollar margins above $110,000 per home. To frame expectations of volume at Sandy, we are expecting somewhere within 30 to 50 homes sold in that community which is driving overall margin for the year up above the 2023 levels. Sure, Samir. During 2023, we had active cost containment strategies in place mainly across payroll, utilities, supply and repair and advertising that are budgeted to return to normalized -- at the normalized state in 2024. This is leading to that expense growth year-over-year in North America, same property of 8.6% at the midpoint. So certainly in supply and repair, we saw a decrease year-over-year for example in 2023, and we are growing off of that base north of 10%. From an expectation standpoint, we certainly will look to continue managing our costs in response right to any revenues, especially on the RV side. And so that could right, that could change over the course of the year. But those are the primary drivers that are taking, call it, overall expense growth higher than in 2023. And Keegan, if I can add, similar to our non-strategic asset capital recycling program here in the US, we are under those plans in the UK as well, where we can potentially monetize a few assets from the portfolio over the course of this year. Eric, on the interest expense quickly right there were increases to underlying rates over the course of 2023. So, there is a full year of that impact at the higher rates than where they started in 2023, which should help bridge that gap. As it relates to recurring capital expenditures for our business, we are expecting $120 million, $125 million of recurring CapEx across our platform in total currently, and this is something that we are continuing to work through. But we are underwriting and all other categories, right? We've mentioned expansion ground-up development and redevelopment, but spending over 50% less in CapEx in the other categories than we did in 2023. Given that we are spending less on the ground-up development and expansion side, there is a production year-over-year in capitalized interest. Wes, let me get back to you with that exact amount. I don't have it in front of me. Sure. So Wes, this is in an effort to better refine the indirect expenses to their revenue drivers. This is no different. If you'll recall when the Marina portfolio joined the same-property pool we did have a re-class exercise between real property and SRD&E mainly. As the Park Holidays portfolio joined our same-property pool, we did undertake the same exercise in aligning and -- best aligning those indirect expenses to the revenue drivers. While there are -- there is some impact across other categories, the primary ones are in home sales and SRD&E. The indirect expenses being reallocated or payroll -- shared payroll benefits, and taxes, advertising, utilities, credit card processing fees that are now best going to those revenue drivers themselves. And there's no impact of overall NOI productivity from the properties themselves. And Brad, to frame roughly on the UK home sales NOI, Sandy is expected to contribute about 10% of our -- of the overall NOI contribution for the year. The other asset that Gary mentioned, [indiscernible] has a nominal contribution to real property, about $1 million. Sure Anthony, their transient growth expected in the UK for this year is at about 250 basis points of growth year-over-year. So that certainly is a driver, of revenue being -- revenue growth being less than the rental increase of north of 7%. And then, it would be timing of nonrenewals to when we are expecting the sales and bringing in new homeowners. So, there is right as you know, our rental increases go out in the fall. We already have over a 90% renewal for the portfolio, but it essentially is timing differences from an occupancy perspective. So Anthony, thank you for the question. On the revenue side, prior we are expecting transient revenue growth for the portfolio to be at -- to be down about 2% -- 2.75% for the year and that is what we are currently underwriting. And we are -- we do have higher expenses expected for the portfolio this year. And again, it's returning to more normal conditions. Last year, we did put in a number of active cost containment strategies across payroll utilities and supply and repair. And budgeting, forecasting for those to be at more normal levels over the course of 2024 is driving expense increase year-over-year of just under 10% for the year. That's -- those are the two drivers where our NOI growth at the midpoint is expected at 2.8%. We are forecasting another very strong year of conversions for our portfolio that will continue to drive operational efficiencies over the course of the next couple of years. Anthony, I'm sorry. Can you ask the question as it cut in and out? That is primarily driven by the site conversions that occurred over the course of last year and continued conversions into this year. Given that we converted last year over 6% of our sites, we are underwriting strong rate growth on the transient side. That is -- that gets you to the down year-over-year about 2.75% currently."

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, management asks that you limit yourself to one question, so everyone who would like to participate has ample opportunity. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining our call to discuss third quarter results and our updated 2023 guidance. We reported another strong quarter with core FFO per share of $2.57, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Total same-property NOI growth of 6.7% meaningfully outperformed guidance, demonstrating how our properties high demand and scarce supply fundamentals generate durable growing real property income. Same-property NOI growth was fueled primarily by solid revenue growth and continued cost saving initiatives across our properties. In our manufactured housing segment, third quarter same-property NOI grew 8% as compared to 2022, supported by a 6.1% increase in monthly base rent per site and occupancy gains. Within our RV communities, the 4.1% same-property NOI growth achieved in the quarter is a testament to continued high demand at our communities, exemplified by the successful execution of our strategy to convert transient sites to annual leases. To-date, our transient to annual conversion surpassed 1,800 sites and we are on pace to meet guidance for the year. On a combined basis, same-property adjusted occupancy for manufactured housing and RV communities increased 170 basis points this quarter compared to last year. And across the total portfolio, revenue producing sites increased by approximately 750 sites during the third quarter, an 8% increase compared to 2022. This brings year-to-date revenue-producing site gains to nearly 2,600. Marinas delivered another very strong quarter with same-property NOI growth of 8.9% over the prior year period. Demand to join our unparalleled safe harbor network remains strong, as demonstrated by the increase in rate lift at 89% for Marinas. Our manufactured housing portfolio in the U.K. will be included in same property results starting January 1st, only reset the same community pool for 2024. For the third quarter, real property NOI in the U.K. grew 15.1% over the same period last year, in line with our expectations. Adjusting for exchange rate changes, U.K. real property NOI increased by 8.7% over the prior year quarter. Home sale activity, which supports the predictable rental income of our communities was in line with our expectations and is tracking within our guidance ranges for the year. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect rental rate growth in our same-property portfolio to exceed inflation. At the midpoint, we expect to realize average annual rental rate increases of 5.4% for manufactured housing in North America and 7.1% in the U.K. We expect a 6.5% increase in annual ROI rates for our annual RV portfolio and 5.6% growth in annual rates across Marinas. We expect these strong rental rate increases, combined with modestly higher occupancies and our ongoing focus on expense management to produce another year of strong organic cash flow growth in 2024. And now I want to give you some perspective on Sun’s broader strategic objectives. The Sun Board and management team are laser-focused on implementing changes designed to streamline our company and position us for growth. Our goal in making such changes is to help ensure that our best-in-class, operationally resilient portfolio delivers the consistent FFO per share growth our stakeholders historically have enjoyed from Sun. For example, we recently sold our stock position in Ingenia, generating over $100 million to pay down variable rate debt. This transaction had the added benefit of being increase the FFO. In addition, we have previously discussed, we continue to advance the process to identify select properties for potential disposition with the intent of further delevering proceeds. As we move forward, we are substantially reducing capital spending, including acquisitions and development activity, in light of the more challenging economic and capital markets environment. This year, as we have stated before, we are completing ground-up development projects that were already underway and a new external growth projects will be solely focused on the most strategic opportunities. Our strategic positive investment activity can be seen in our U.K. operations as well. In 2021, after we announced the agreement to acquire Park Holidays, we extended a loan to RoyaleLife, a U.K. holiday park and manufactured housing developer and operator in a separate transaction. This development opportunity is distinct from our Park Holidays business. Our loan to RoyaleLife is collateralized by real estate and several other assets. We have selectively and partnered with strategic counterparts for development throughout Sun’s history. As macroeconomic conditions rapidly deteriorated in the U.K., we decided not to pursue incremental acquisitions to develop. Since that decision, RoyaleLife engaged with several lenders to repair a note, but was unable to do so. Ultimately, at the end of September, we appointed a receiver to enforce our interest in the real estate securing our loan. We continue to assess our options as we take the note through the receivership process. Additionally, Sandy Bay is a premier manufacturing housing community in the U.K. we acquired in 2022. It has 730 operating sites and can be expanded by an additional 450 sites. As part of our broad strategic portfolio review, we decided to sell the property and headed under contract to be sold to RoyaleLife, backed by additional financial investors and lenders. While that transaction is not progressing, we are in discussions with other potential buyers and in the meantime, continue to benefit from the community’s contribution to real property NOI. Now Sun has 30-year history as a public company, we have demonstrated operational reliability and cash flow strength throughout economic cycles and we are continuing to see this in the solid performance of our real property business. We remain optimistic about our performance and organic cash flow generation in the near-term, supported by our anticipated rental increases in 2024. However, we recognize the headwinds from today’s challenging macro environment. And as I said, we are taking actions and steps to realign our strategy to focus on our proven, durable income streams. We are recycling capital out of non-core investments, including our operating portfolio to monetize lower-growth communities and remaining disciplined and deliberate in pursuing only the highest growth capital expenditure projects. As we implement these rate sizing activities in the coming quarters, we are optimistic the market will recognize how these activities will decrease our leverage and target a return to the consistency of our earnings we have long enjoyed. As always, the management team and I are grateful for the hard work and accomplishments of the entire Sun team this quarter and I would like to thank all the team members for their dedication and all of our stakeholders for their support. Fernando will now discuss our results in more detail. Fernando?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Gary. Third quarter core FFO of $2.57 per share was $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range. Expense savings at the property and corporate level were the primary contributor to outperformance as compared to our midpoint. Sun’s total same-property NOI for the quarter increased 6.7% as compared to last year, outperforming the high end of our guidance by 220 basis points. Our performance was driven by same-property revenue growth of 5.5% and lower-than-expected property operating expense growth of 3%. For the quarter, same-property manufactured housing NOI increased 8%, driven by a rental rate increase of 6.1%, continued occupancy gains and focus on expense management. RV same-property NOI grew 4.1% due to an 8.8% increase in weighted average annual rental rate, approximately 2,100 transient to annual site conversions over the trailing 12 months and ongoing operational programs to mitigate expense growth. These were partially offset by a 4.4% decline in transient RV revenues, as transient occupancy normalizes. Adjusting for the decrease in sites converted to annual, transient revenue grew 2.2% relative to the prior year period. Over the Labor Day holiday weekend, same-property transient RV revenue was down 1.5%, as compared to last year’s holiday weekend. Adjusting for the 5.7% decrease in transient sites converted to annual, transient RV revenue increased by 4.4%. We continue to drive the pace of transient to annual RV lease conversions to increase our percent of sticky revenues. This quarter, we converted nearly 540 sites to annual leases, for a year-to-date total of over 1,800 conversions. In Marinas, same-property NOI increased 8.9% in the third quarter as compared to 2022, an 8.4% increase in revenues highlights the strong demand to be part of our network. Our performance was due to solid rental rate increase, longer stays by guests in our Southeastern Marinas and operating expense savings, particularly within payroll and utilities. In the U.K., real property NOI for the quarter of $29 million was in line with our guidance. Retention rates among our U.K. owners is holding steady. With an average resident tenure that approaches eight years. The increased retention over 2022 was a meaningful driver of real property income growth this year. Turning to home sales. North American home sales contribution was broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter, where lower volume was offset by higher margins. In the U.K., despite economic headwinds continuing to challenge home sales volumes, we sold 2,310 homes through the end of the third quarter. Fourth quarter to-date, we have sold 204 homes, leaving approximately 300 homes to be sold to achieve our full year volume guidance. In terms of NOI, we are on track to achieve the midpoint of prior guidance, which approximates just over $70 million for the full year. Regarding our balance sheet, since our last call, we have focused on decreasing leverage and variable rate debt. During and subsequent to the third quarter, we entered into $150 million of SOFR swaps on our U.S. dollar line of credit at a fixed SOFR rate of 4.8% through April 2026. As Gary discussed, we sold our position in Ingenia and used the net proceeds of approximately $100 million to pay down borrowings on our line of credit. Additionally, we refinanced approximately $118 million of secured debt that was maturing this year with approximately $250 million of new secured debt. Adjusted to include the positive impact of a $50 million SOFT swap executed in March, the new loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.25% and mature in 2030. Taking this activity into account, we had $7.6 billion in debt outstanding at a weighted average rate of 4.15% and had a weighted average maturity of approximately seven years. Our trailing 12-month leverage ratio was 6 times and approximately 14% of our debt is floating. Turning to guidance for the year. We are revising our full year core FFO per share guidance downward by 1% at the midpoint to a range of $7.05 to $7.13 and establishing a fourth quarter core FFO per share guidance range of $1.28 to $1.36. Our revised guidance for the year is driven primarily by, higher expected interest expense in the fourth quarter, related primarily to the U.K. note remaining outstanding, U.K. home sales NOI performing towards the midpoint of our range and lower expectations for transient revenue in the U.S. Regarding the U.K. note, through the first nine months of this year, we recognized $28 million or approximately $0.22 per share in interest income. There is no interest income from this note in fourth quarter guidance. We previously expected to pay down debt with the notes repayment, which would have generated roughly $5 million or approximately $0.04 a share of interest expense savings in the fourth quarter. For U.K. home sales, we expect to finish the year within our prior guidance range, with home sales volume of around 500 units in the fourth quarter. We are forecasting lower margins on these home sales as U.K. consumers continue to favor pre-owned homes and part exchanges to new home. NOI margins on U.K. home sales for the first nine months averaged $26,000 and our revised guidance assumes average NOI margins of approximately $20,000 per home in the fourth quarter. Our same property portfolio is by far the largest driver of our results, representing over 90% of NOI. Based on results to-date and our expectations for continued strong demand, bolstered by effective expense management, we are increasing total same-property NOI guidance by 50 basis points from 5.7% growth at the midpoint of the prior range to a new midpoint of 6.2%. The increase is based on higher expectations at our same-property manufactured housing and Marinas properties, partially offset by slower growth in RV addressed earlier. At the midpoint, the 5.8% to 6.1% NOI growth we now expect from MH is 45 basis points higher than the midpoint of the prior range. And our same-property RV portfolio, we now expect NOI to grow 3.5% to 4.2%, which represents a 15-basis-point decrease at the midpoint as compared to prior guidance. For same-property Marinas, we expect NOI to increase to a range of 10% to 10.3% for the year, a 165-basis-point increase from our prior assumed range of 8% to 9%. Additionally, and as Gary discussed, we are providing guidance on preliminary rental rate increases for 2024. At the midpoint, we expect to realize average annual rental rate increases of 5.4% for manufactured housing in North America and 7.1% in the U.K. We expect a 6.5% increase in annual rental rates for our annual RV portfolio and 5.6% growth in annual rates of cost Marinas. For additional details regarding our updated full year guidance, please see our supplemental disclosures. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through October 25th. Our guidance does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research anal assessments. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSamir Khanal: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Gary, maybe provide a little bit more detail on your sort of your plan to sell assets. I guess what’s the transaction market look like in the U.K. and the U.S.? Just trying to figure out your ability to sell those assets as it relates to the U.K. loan. You kind of stated about Sandy Bay. I think it was in the market, now it’s held for sale. Just want to -- maybe you can provide a bit more color on the market in the U.K.? Thanks.\nGary Shiffman: I think underlying our goal to sell assets as we have shared with the market. It’s just a use of recycling capital and paying down debt. Generally, these are all high quality assets and they are performing in the portfolio. But for various reasons, we think that bringing them to market and being able to pay down higher priced debt would be favorable as we go forward. So in North America, we have shared we have done a kind of deep dive and identified some assets to bring to market. Those first group of assets are either currently or in the next week will be marketed and we will determine at that time, how the market feels in North America. As everyone is aware, there’s been very, very little transaction in the manufacturing RV market. So it -- there are no data points to point to right now. We know that rates are significantly up, but these are good high quality assets. So we look forward to being able to share with you on our next call or if we are able to execute on anything before our next call, how the market is responding to those assets. With regard to the U.K., in particular, those that are collateralized by the Royale loan -- RoyaleLife assets, because we are in the receivership period, there’s really little that we can comment on. But during the receivership period, we are in dialogue with optionality on those assets and will continue to be so. And then we talked about Sandy Bay, it’s a really high quality premier asset, 730 sites with a big expansion piece to it and we are in dialogue with a number of people regarding a potential sale there as well. So we will be very pleased to be able to share with everybody what the market is looking like as we began the first steps of marketing.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. And then, I guess, just as a follow-up and maybe changing the subject here on Marinas, that continues to show strength. I would have thought you would have been able to push the rates for 2024 a little bit higher. I mean your rate was 5.6%. I understand there’s been a moderation in inflation, but I would have thought maybe the rate would have been higher. Can you provide a bit more color around that?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. I think it speaks to how we have shared with our stakeholders over 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years of business, kind of the slow marathon over the Sprint and our approach to want to be able to really get outsized growth above inflation. When inflation is low and when inflation is high, last year, we got off 7.2%, 7.3% rental increase. So we really are enjoying heavy, heavy demand and want to continue to see it continue. So we think that we have really set the rent in a way that over a long period of time, we will be able to maintain NOI growth in excess of inflation, and at the same time, retain high occupancy. So after a couple of years of tremendous growth, we look forward to continuing that growth and set the rental rate very thoughtful for 2024.\nSamir Khanal: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nWes Golladay: Hi, everyone. Maybe looking into next year, can we talk about some of the bigger moving parts that we should be aware of. One, in particular, I want to give more clarity on, would be home sale volume expansion and development? Will that have any impact in the U.S?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. I will take the first part and Fernando wants to add anything. I think we have been very, very clear that with regard to use of capital and our free cash flow, the most highest priority and best use for that free capital will be to reduce leverage. As we look at this high capital cost environment that we are in right now, recognizing that we do get very, very strong IRRs on expansion usually in the 10% to 13% range. I mentioned RV and new development on the high single double-digit, those are IRRs and they do take a period of time, they are initially dilutive. So by putting those things on hold moving forward, our expectation is that in a better economic environment. We have the inventory of sites on hand and we can resume our expansion and development activities. So as it stands right now and we will share exact numbers as we go forward in guidance for 2024. The expectation is to have a very limited capital investment in the development area and it’s just a fact from where we are sitting and see the cost of capital right now.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: And Wes, to add to Gary’s comments, we have inventory to sell on the manufactured housing side. By the end of the year we will be delivering nearly 1,000. We will have to deliver nearly 1,000 new sites across expansion and ground up development. So that would support the home sales volume or contribution to NOI here in the U.S. Where we would say, should be around what we expect to get this year.\nWes Golladay: Okay.\nGary Shiffman: And with regards to home sales volume, again, in the U.K. we have the sites, we have the homes. The U.K. Park Holidays team is doing a remarkable job. We are very, very pleased with how home sales are continuing, although they are guided down from the beginning of the year and we will be able to share those guidance post with 2024 guidance.\nWes Golladay: And then a follow-up on the balance sheet. You have taken the variable rate down. I believe you said Fernando, about 14% is floating now. Should we think the balance just being repaid off with the asset sales? Are you going to keep a certain amount of floating?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: We will continue to look to move that percentage downward. Certainly, the immediate use of proceeds of free cash flow in 2024, as well as any proceeds from dispositions or other activities would be to pay down debt. Yes.\nWes Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. Fernando, what percentage of the roughly $360 million loan to RoyaleLife is secured by real estate versus the OpCos or the manufacturers?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. Hi, John. About 70% is secured by real estate and the other $30 million by the operating companies.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Can you just give us any sense of magnitude of the -- in your guys’ minds what’s a reasonable base case for the level of impairment of the $360 million loan?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. I think that based on what we have shared we have had third-party appraisers throughout the process at the beginning, and as recently as June 1st, provide appraisals and the overall appraisals, I think, last came out about 80%.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: At the midpoint of value. We -- the loan is covered at 80%.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Back in June 1st and so it’s a lot lower now, is that fair?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: No. That’s not the assumption. The valuations do cover a wide range of scenarios in that analysis with our third-party providers and appraisers. So, no, that would not be the assumption.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Last one for me. Can you just give us, I guess, what specific expense control initiatives were rolled out to result in such a large reduction to expense growth guidance this year and should we expect these benefits to continue into 2024?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. John, I would say, the primary driver has been in response to normalizing transient revenue growth and given normalizing occupancy, any variable expenses at the property level have been managed across payroll, supply repair and utilities. As it relates to our Marina portfolio, for example, we have some of the growth capital that we have invested have been in solar projects that are driving lower utility expense year-over-year for those properties. So, yes, much of that would be sustainable and the -- our expense control on the variable side is in response to topline. So we would continue to look to mitigate the impact of lower revenues, if that would be the case.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Thanks for taking all the questions.\nGary Shiffman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Hey. Thanks everybody. Thinking back to last year, you obviously gave some impressive rate indications in 3Q 2022, but we were all surprised by how that translated into FFO when the full guide came out. Obviously, you are not going to give 2024 guidance yet, but just given a similarly high set of increases, do you think we will see Sun return to a more normal level of FFO growth next year or are there other headwinds like this loan that might prevent that from happening?\nGary Shiffman: Brad, our expectation is with 90%-plus of our revenue being derived from those real property operations and with the fact that 30% to 40%, maybe by year-end close to 50%. Those rental rate increases will all be out there with good expense control, should continue to see the benefit of high occupancy, solid rental increases and expense control, as Fernando just referred to.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Brad, you have seen operational leverage at the corporate level with more muted G&A growth and we believe any activity, as it relates to episodic capital recycling events, right, will reduce not just leverage, but then also any interest expense impact of growth, that we did see this year and was a large contributor to the flow-through from same-property growth not showing up in FFO per share growth.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. Perfect. And then on the 2024 rate indications, I think, you just said, close to 50%. But I am curious if you could just talk about how locked in those are and I assume that there’s different numbers across the different businesses for how many of those rates have been fully set for 2024?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. So by the end of October, just over 40% of our manufactured housing portfolio will have been noticed and those have been at about a 5.4% increase. They will be around half of the portfolio will happen notice by the end of the year. On the RV side, about 60% of our residents have been noticed at this point. In the U.K., 100% of residents have been noticed at this point. And Marinas, essentially our Southeastern or Southern Marinas have been noticed and the rest are rolling over time.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Appreciate it.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. It’s actually Nick Joseph here with Eric. Gary, you mentioned in the press release, I think, on the call as well, implementing the select changes. It sounds like you have talked about CapEx spend and dispositions to pay off floating like debt and some other opportunities that you think will get back to earnings growth and it sounds like that earnings growth will be in 2024. But how about on the G&A side and the integration on the back end of some of these portfolio companies on the U.K. and the Marinas. What’s the opportunity there and can you frame some time in around it as well, please?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. I think, I don’t know if that was directed to me or to Fernando, but I will start out with it. I mean, summarizing you are exactly correct. The steps that we are thinking about, the fact that we have shared, we stopped new development and the acquisition, continuing converting transient to annual or when you think about those conversions in the last three years, we have actually converted about 20% of our transient sites or will have by the end of this year to annual leases and we will continue to do so. As Fernando mentioned, we sold our stock position in Ingenia, all looking to recirculate more free cash flow and capital to pay down debt and demonstrating the operational leverage, which you are referring to, is something we are very hyper focused on for 2024. We have continued to see a slowdown and even minor reduction in the growth that we have seen for the last five years, seven years, and certainly, for the last two years, three years as we brought these portfolios in. And Eric, we are working really hard and look forward to sharing with you the outlook for 2024. As we have owned the portfolios and will have owned the portfolios for two years to three years and I think that, that will also underscore how we are able to deliver bottomline FFO growth moving forward.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. I guess just more specific to G&A, though, right? So you have different management industry for these portfolio.\nGary Shiffman: That is what I am referencing. It is our goal to be able to share the 2024 expectations for G&A and to have created leverage moving forward.\nNick Joseph: All right. Thanks. And then just on Ingenia, obviously, you sold the stock, but you have the JV that had been extended there. Can you talk about the timing and the potential monetization of that investment?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. Sure. First of all, I’d say that we are very pleased with our relationship with the Ingenia folks and we set out to have this JV Sungenia in 2018 and while we sold our entire investment in the Ingenia stock, they are great partners in the Sungenia development and we don’t have to -- we do no longer have someone on the overall Board. We are able to allow them to focus on the day-to-day management and operations of the development and the fact of the matter is that after all that time and the investment, the work that’s now completed and the backdrop of demand in Australia for retirement housing, the near-term returns are very attractive and we are very positive about the cash flow over the next 12 months. Again, that’s something we will be able to lay out in 2024. So, we have invested five years for what is expected in 2024 and I think that that will be pretty clearly laid out as we provide guidance and then we can talk about thoughts going forward from there.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. We will get back in the queue.\nGary Shiffman: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKeegan Carl: Yeah. Thanks for the time guys. Maybe first, just wondering if you could walk through your reconciliation of your FFO per share guidance, where we went from negative $0.10 a share to positive $0.02 a share in the other adjustments line item?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hi, Keegan. Yes. There -- while there are various line items that contribute to that change, the primary drivers will be the re-measurement of marketable securities, which is Ingenia on a quarter-to-quarter basis, which accounted for about $0.06 and then any unrealized gain/loss on FX changes, again, in the quarter that accounts for 5 of them -- $0.05.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And then, I guess, I am struggling to with the Marinas rate increase. I was a little disappointed in the number, but I also know that there’s not good data on Marinas. So I am just curious, do you have an idea of what your hypothetical loss to lease will look like on that portfolio, given where market rents would be today if some were to come in and put their boat there?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. I think that after two years of ownership of the Marinas and the 7.3% rental increase last year and seeing the demand, as I said, what Sun’s always focused on is the ability to give sustain -- sustainable returns year-after year-on a same community basis and the fact of the matter is that a lot of thought and dialogue went into that rental increase. So that in the coming years, we will be able to look for continued long-term growth in the same way, as we had in our MH and RV portfolios. We don’t have much marked lease pickup, just because there’s very, very little turnover, well, I will say, in our MH and annual RV portfolio as well as our Marinas. So on the MH side, not to drift, but to share with you 15-year average turnover nearly 98% occupancy, less than 0.5% of the homes move out a year and the fact that we don’t have many leases that are directly tied to CPI or any long-term leases. So our market rents or our current rents seem to be pretty close by standard to market and we feel the same is true on the Marinas side and we have always shared that an empty site or in this case, in the Marinas and empty slip is the most costly slip that we have. So as we look for providing solid performance in 2024, we arrived at the 5.6% increase and it does really not provide for very much, if any market -- mark-to-mark rental increase at all as does the rest of our portfolio.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Thanks for the time guys.\nGary Shiffman: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey, guys. Just maybe a follow-up on that marine rate growth of 5.6%. What -- I guess, how should we also think about maybe occupancy increases in that line of business, like maybe it would be helpful to just hear what rate growth you sent out for last year in the occupancy uplift?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. I don’t have the occupancy uplift for 2023. Of course, 2024 will give that thought as part of the guided range, but...\nJosh Dennerlein: Yeah. I guess I am just trying to figure out of that 5.6% is like kind of static or like if there’s potential kind of upside relative to kind of where that is, as I think about rental revenue on that side?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hey, Josh. The -- through year-to-date on non-transient income on the Marinas side has just -- has been just under 10% and our rental increase in the 7.5% range. So from a back of the envelope math, roughly 200 basis points of occupancy gain in that number.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. Okay. Awesome. And then just the U.K. sale that, I guess, it was disclosed in February, but didn’t go through. What’s, sorry if I missed it, I had to jump on late on the call. What’s the back story there?\nGary Shiffman: Well, we acquired a really high quality premier manufactured housing community in the U.K. in late 2021 and as we move forward with the RoyaleLife Group and determined that we would provide them a note for them to pay us back with that loan. They were also working with a group that was interested in acquiring Sandy Bay and we shared with the market at that time. It was an offer we were willing to accept, as we are looking to really reduce our capital commitments in the U.K. And as completely separate from RoyaleLife and completely separate from Park Holidays. We agreed and entered into a contract with that group to sell Sandy Bay. And now that, that’s not moving forward, we will continue to operate it and hold it for sale and recognize the income. It’s about 730 existing sites with expansion potential of 450 and -- that’s what I had shared earlier.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. But I guess why didn’t the sale go through? Was it related to the buyer couldn’t find financing or something else?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. I can’t comment too much on RoyaleLife other than the same things that everyone is aware of that they have been taken under certain aspects of it have been taken under receivership and the recapitalization, as I understand it, is certainly stalled, if not terminated at this time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on the guidance and some of the moving pieces there. I am not sure if we touched on this earlier, but it seems like the NOI guidance moves higher and then that would be kind of offset by the higher interest expense, as a result of not using the proceeds of this note to pay that down. So what were the moving pieces kind of like below the line that drove the FFO guidance lower, was that the Ingenia piece?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hi, Michael. No. Ingenia would have nothing to do as it relates. Only as it relates to the pay down the $9 million loss recognized is essentially marking the value of the shares at the end of the third quarter at A$4.20 to our ultimate sale price of A$3.90. So that would not impact our guidance. As it relates to the guide, certainly higher interest expense, as it relates to the note not being repaid. There’s some additional interest expense in there as well, but it’s primarily the note on the Park Holiday side from a home sales perspective, we provided guidance in July with the high end of about US$75 million. We are expecting that to be closer to the midpoint. And frankly, we give guidance and we provide ranges and some outcomes, right? We have parts of the business that outperform and others that performs at the midpoint or to the low end. And transient mentioned in my remarks, transient revenue is down on a guide to guide standpoint where -- when we spoke in July, we were expecting about a 4% decline in transient revenues and we are now expecting about a 7% on for the full year. We will look to offset and mitigate some of that impact with expense savings as we have done in the third quarter.\nMichael Goldsmith: Okay. Thanks for that. My second question is a little bit more strategic in nature. What is the profile of the properties that you are looking for sale, like is there anything specific about the Sandy Bay property that made it a good candidate, was it the fact that had these development sites in like the additional capital into it? And then, finally, allowing the same line, do you have a target leverage ratio, which you are looking to move down to through the sale of some of these properties? Thank you.\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. On the Sandy Bay, I think, it -- as we have shared, it just was, it’s very high quality, very high-profile property. The fact of the matter is that we determined we did not want to increase our capital exposure in the U.K., and therefore, took the offer and the opportunity to put it up for sale and we will continue to market it, and as I said during the income, as that process goes forward. So nothing particular about that. In North America, I think, what we shared before is, we did sort of a deep dive looking for where we can recycle capital. We looked at all of our properties, and the fact of the matter, we have some properties, where they are in a single location, we probably expected to be able to acquire more properties in the area, but the fact of the matter is, they are not efficient to operate without more properties in the area. So those are the candidates. And then we have some smaller properties, that really don’t fit the size of the company right now in the way that we operate. So those are the types of things that fall in the bucket. They are all performing, they are not cats and dogs, and we just selectively bucketed those opportunities to recycle capital.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: And then, Michael, as it relates to long-term leverage targets. We stated our goal is to be at 5.5 times and below from a leverage perspective. Pro forma for the Ingenia stock sale, we are -- on a trailing basis we are now at 6 times. So we will through free cash flow and then through these episodic sales we will look to get to and within that range.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck on the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. In the U.K., can you just comment on, who drove the decision to move forward with 2 separate transactions with RoyaleLife? Was it the local Park Holidays team or was it your team in Michigan?\nGary Shiffman: As I said before, they are not related to Park Holidays. They are separate and distinct and it was management.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Yes. I mean I am sure you are aware of this and you can hear this on the call, but in meetings you have had. But the performance of Sun is getting completely dominated by the U.K. business and I know you are looking to simplify and improve your balance sheet. But I am just wondering how much longer you could stomach having this much exposure to the U.K. and have you contemplated exiting the business? I know you don’t want to buy high and sell low, but looking at the forward growth prospects of all your different businesses, why not contemplate exiting the U.K.?\nGary Shiffman: Well, John, I think, it’s important to understand that, first of all, the management team is doing very well there. And the growth and reliability the real property income is achieving management’s goals, although home sales and the challenging environment aren’t and there’s been a big focus by stakeholders. Who clearly are focused on home sales and how they are lower than we originally guided to and the fact that it’s not the business or the percentage that we wanted to be able to contributing income. But we acquired the portfolio in a much different economic environment. When we took the opportunity in what was a strong economy to increase our manufactured home holdings by acquiring Park Holidays. The properties are themselves are excellent and we do believe in the business and the team. That being said, unfortunately, the opportunity in the U.K. has been impacted by really strong economic headwinds, even though the core of the business is performing. So with that being said, in very challenging times, we continue to really review all of our options, but we are very supportive of what the team is accomplishing there and we are very aware of those people, who have shared with us their thoughts on the capital invested in the U.K. Our goal really…\nJohn Kim: Just one more final question for me.\nGary Shiffman: Our goal really is to maximize value for that investment and as we continue to perform and view the U.K., we are happy to share any thoughts that we have moving forward.\nJohn Kim: Just one more final question on me. On the sales that you are planning in the U.S., what kind of cap rate should we expect? You have taken out mortgage debt at 5%, obviously, the interest rate environment is not helping, but what should we be modeling in for exit cap rates?\nGary Shiffman: So I am going to suggest we are going into the market next week with the first group and it would be best if we are able to report realize market data and not interfere with the process that’s taking place as we go out to the market.\nJohn Kim: Great. Thank you.\nGary Shiffman: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and I appreciate the commentary on the Board and management team focused on streamlining the company for growth. As I think about the last year, a big part of the Sun story for investors has really been just kind of surprises. Taking down U.K. Park Holiday guidance and then the loan -- the U.K. loan. So as you are thinking about selling assets, deleveraging, I mean, that all makes sense. But like what can you say to like this process also making sure that there’s just not stuff that kind of catches people off guard or out of left field, that maybe you can’t see quite as clearly from the balance sheet or some of the reporting for the company?\nGary Shiffman: I am only going to suggest that there is a tremendous effort from the Board of Directors down to management to make sure that we provide as much transparency as we can. So that those type of surprises, although they weren’t economic headwinds in the U.K. came about very, very fast and had obviously dramatic impacts on these things that you are referencing. But I think what you are finding is that everything is clearly in disclosure and clearly open to discussion by the management team and we want nothing more than to be as transparent as possible. So that there aren’t any surprises going forward.\nJames Feldman: Okay. Thanks for that. And then as we think about -- can you talk to what kind of pre-COVID run rates were for -- whether it’s Marina business or even the MH business or even the U.K. business? Just to give us a sense of what we should expect in terms of longer term run rate for these businesses, once the COVID activity fade?\nGary Shiffman: I think that speaking to some communities, which has been public for 30 years. We have business lines that all have the same underlying fundamentals of high demand against very short supply and MH certainly affordable housing, which drives the high occupancies that historically performed very, very well in all economic times. And so when we share the fact that we have been able to get rental rate increases in excess of inflationary pressure throughout our history and have never delivered as a company, a fourth quarter period, where we didn’t have positive NOI growth. Our expectation and our goal with everything we are doing, with the rental increases, with the priorities that I shared with everybody, with the focus of the strategy that we have been implementing is to continue to get that same kind of same community growth and I have a drop down in an FFO per share basis to our shareholders. So I think, historically, one has to look to how we performed and what we see as the outlook for certainly the rental rate increases that we have going forward and the high occupancies and demand is that we should be able to continue to grow and provide growth as we have historically done as a company. So we are optimistic about moving forward and we certainly have a lot of steps that we identified that we are taking to secure that kind of growth.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess in terms of RV expenses, you have done a good job of reducing expenses, when you have had lower, I guess, transient demand. Are you able to leverage these lower expenses, let’s say, next year, if you have a recovery or stabilization there or do you think you would have to add back more expenses and create some surprises on the expense growth line there?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: I think, Anthony, we are always on the lookout for efficiencies and there are certainly things we are learning as an ops team to run our properties more efficiently. But, certainly, there is flex, right, as it relates to the variable rate or the variable expenses with transient and we are looking at another very strong year of transient site conversions over to the annual side. We are already at 1,800 sites converted as of the end of the third quarter and our -- would expect that elevated level of conversions to continue into 2024, which will -- which does continue to reduce transient revenue as a percentage of total revenues for the portfolio.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Maybe one more expense question on insurance. I guess, so far this year, I think, it’s been a less destructive hurricane season. I know we talked about some initiatives to reducing service expense increases at NAREIT in June. So maybe update us on how you are looking at expense growth for insurance next year and will you be able to maybe have a better outcome on that line item?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. I just got back from London a couple of weeks ago with the initial meetings with the syndicate. The tone of the conversations is certainly more constructive than it was a year ago at this time and we are working through the insurance program as we speak with our broker and the syndicate itself. As we mentioned at NAREIT, we have not implemented significant changes to our historical insurance program and so that is something that we will be looking to do to mitigate the large increase that we saw this year of 40% across our MH, RV and Marinas business, but mitigating that increase year-over-year heading into 2024. As a reminder, our power program renews at the end of the year and so we will look to share with the market at that time once we have bound our coverage.\nAnthony Powell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Hau with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Hau: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, you mentioned that you guys are focused on only pursuing the highest growth capital projects. Can you provide a little bit more color on what type of projects they are and what type of returns should you expect from these opportunities and what projects are you guys coming back?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. I think it’s very, very limited scope. There will be certain expansions where there’s high demand in some of our MH communities and actually a backlog of potential sales. So some small expansion opportunity. And then, in Marinas, where we identify a great opportunity that provide 10% to 13% rapid returns on investments, reconfiguration of slips and other small expansions that we can do. Those are the type of areas that we will be focusing on.\nAnthony Hau: Got you. I also noticed that the roof out rate year-to-date is like 3.7%, which is at least 100 bps higher than the last couple of years. What are the top reasons for the move out and where are the residents moving to home to? Is there a good difference in move-out rate for age qualifier or age?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Anthony, that move-out rate is a combination of manufactured housing and RV. So the -- what I can share is that as it relates to our manufactured housing portfolio move-out, rates are largely the same as they have been historically. We have seen some higher move-outs on the RV side. But as I shared a bit earlier, right, our 1,800 site conversions are a net number. So we are continuing to fill sites, fill vacancy as it relates to on the RV side and are implementing various strategies to look to lengthen that stay at our properties.\nAnthony Hau: So the RV move out, they are not the park models that’s moving out, right? It’s mainly the wheel vehicles, right?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: That would be correct.\nAnthony Hau: Okay. And like my last question is like for the assets that you guys are marketing next week, are these considered like 4 to 5 star parts and do they qualify for agency loans?\nGary Shiffman: I think they are a select small group, as I said, both small and large assets that would be high quality assets and my expectation is they would qualify for agency loans.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Yes. Anthony, the comment would be that both Fannie and Freddie finance, manufactured housing across the quality spectrum. They also finance RV resorts that are beer mostly towards the annual side.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. I just wanted to clarify maybe an answer that Fernando had given, I think, to John Pawlowski, early on about the collateral on the U.K. loan. Fernando, did you say that it was a -- today it was at 80% loan to value or that the assets only were worth 80% of the loan amount? I just want to make sure I understood that correctly and I had a quick follow-up on that.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. Steve. 80% loan-to-value.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And maybe back when the loan was originated, what was the loan-to-value when you guys work with the accounting firm to figure out what that collateral was worth?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: About 60% Steve.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Wolfe: Thanks. I guess is it possible just to provide interest expense guidance for this year, and then I guess, going forward, I mean, it would be great to get that. And then the second part of it is, is just if there’s anything considered in guidance like asset sales or something else that would reduce that interest expense later this year just so where is it?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. Eric, no perspective, acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities are factored into our guidance. For the full year we are expecting interest expense to be somewhere between $328 million and $330 million.\nEric Wolfe: That’s helpful. And then just a follow-up on Steve’s question there. Going from 60% to 80%, that’s mainly because the second piece, the seller financing was done at like 100% LTV. So originally, it was at 60% and then you added to the balance, I think, about $108 million, 109 million and presumably that was closer to like 100%. Is that the right way to think about it?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Yeah. The additional the land sale that was sold in February was at 100% LTV. So that would increase the LTV and some additional accrued interest would also increase the LTV there. So it would not be a measure of the collateral itself.\nEric Wolfe: Right. And is it possible to provide the debt yield or NOI on the assets, debt yield maybe just the NOI and maybe debt [ph] or just the NOI just in general for the collateral properties?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. I think that that’s something that is going to come out of the work that’s being done with the receivership, and at this time, there’s very little we can comment about those properties. But it is all inclusive of the third-party appraisals that we had done and so it is included to get to that value. But what I would suggest the vast majority is the value of the properties themselves and the entitlement.\nEric Wolfe: Great. Okay. All right. Thanks for taking the follow-ups.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Yeah. Thanks for kicking the call going. Fernando, I just want to make sure I interpreted some of your comments of how NOI is going to flow through to earnings going forward. How I interpreted it was you do expect earnings growth for next year relative to calendar year 2023. Is that a fair interpretation?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Yes.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Are there -- back to Nick Joseph’s question about G&A, are there corporate cost-cutting initiatives going to lead to declines in G&A next year relative to calendar year 2023?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. I think we would share that when we provide guidance.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot for the time today.\nGary Shiffman: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Chairman, President and CEO, Gary Shiffman for closing remarks.\nGary Shiffman: Well, for those of you who are still on, we appreciate your patience and we really do look forward to providing full guidance for 2024 fourth quarter earnings call and I look forward to speaking to everybody then. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good afternoon. And thank you for joining our call to discuss third quarter results and our updated 2023 guidance. We reported another strong quarter with core FFO per share of $2.57, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Total same-property NOI growth of 6.7% meaningfully outperformed guidance, demonstrating how our properties high demand and scarce supply fundamentals generate durable growing real property income. Same-property NOI growth was fueled primarily by solid revenue growth and continued cost saving initiatives across our properties. In our manufactured housing segment, third quarter same-property NOI grew 8% as compared to 2022, supported by a 6.1% increase in monthly base rent per site and occupancy gains. Within our RV communities, the 4.1% same-property NOI growth achieved in the quarter is a testament to continued high demand at our communities, exemplified by the successful execution of our strategy to convert transient sites to annual leases. To-date, our transient to annual conversion surpassed 1,800 sites and we are on pace to meet guidance for the year. On a combined basis, same-property adjusted occupancy for manufactured housing and RV communities increased 170 basis points this quarter compared to last year. And across the total portfolio, revenue producing sites increased by approximately 750 sites during the third quarter, an 8% increase compared to 2022. This brings year-to-date revenue-producing site gains to nearly 2,600. Marinas delivered another very strong quarter with same-property NOI growth of 8.9% over the prior year period. Demand to join our unparalleled safe harbor network remains strong, as demonstrated by the increase in rate lift at 89% for Marinas. Our manufactured housing portfolio in the U.K. will be included in same property results starting January 1st, only reset the same community pool for 2024. For the third quarter, real property NOI in the U.K. grew 15.1% over the same period last year, in line with our expectations. Adjusting for exchange rate changes, U.K. real property NOI increased by 8.7% over the prior year quarter. Home sale activity, which supports the predictable rental income of our communities was in line with our expectations and is tracking within our guidance ranges for the year. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect rental rate growth in our same-property portfolio to exceed inflation. At the midpoint, we expect to realize average annual rental rate increases of 5.4% for manufactured housing in North America and 7.1% in the U.K. We expect a 6.5% increase in annual ROI rates for our annual RV portfolio and 5.6% growth in annual rates across Marinas. We expect these strong rental rate increases, combined with modestly higher occupancies and our ongoing focus on expense management to produce another year of strong organic cash flow growth in 2024. And now I want to give you some perspective on Sun's broader strategic objectives. The Sun Board and management team are laser-focused on implementing changes designed to streamline our company and position us for growth. Our goal in making such changes is to help ensure that our best-in-class, operationally resilient portfolio delivers the consistent FFO per share growth our stakeholders historically have enjoyed from Sun. For example, we recently sold our stock position in Ingenia, generating over $100 million to pay down variable rate debt. This transaction had the added benefit of being increase the FFO. In addition, we have previously discussed, we continue to advance the process to identify select properties for potential disposition with the intent of further delevering proceeds. As we move forward, we are substantially reducing capital spending, including acquisitions and development activity, in light of the more challenging economic and capital markets environment. This year, as we have stated before, we are completing ground-up development projects that were already underway and a new external growth projects will be solely focused on the most strategic opportunities. Our strategic positive investment activity can be seen in our U.K. operations as well. In 2021, after we announced the agreement to acquire Park Holidays, we extended a loan to RoyaleLife, a U.K. holiday park and manufactured housing developer and operator in a separate transaction. This development opportunity is distinct from our Park Holidays business. Our loan to RoyaleLife is collateralized by real estate and several other assets. We have selectively and partnered with strategic counterparts for development throughout Sun's history. As macroeconomic conditions rapidly deteriorated in the U.K., we decided not to pursue incremental acquisitions to develop. Since that decision, RoyaleLife engaged with several lenders to repair a note, but was unable to do so. Ultimately, at the end of September, we appointed a receiver to enforce our interest in the real estate securing our loan. We continue to assess our options as we take the note through the receivership process. Additionally, Sandy Bay is a premier manufacturing housing community in the U.K. we acquired in 2022. It has 730 operating sites and can be expanded by an additional 450 sites. As part of our broad strategic portfolio review, we decided to sell the property and headed under contract to be sold to RoyaleLife, backed by additional financial investors and lenders. While that transaction is not progressing, we are in discussions with other potential buyers and in the meantime, continue to benefit from the community's contribution to real property NOI. Now Sun has 30-year history as a public company, we have demonstrated operational reliability and cash flow strength throughout economic cycles and we are continuing to see this in the solid performance of our real property business. We remain optimistic about our performance and organic cash flow generation in the near-term, supported by our anticipated rental increases in 2024. However, we recognize the headwinds from today's challenging macro environment. And as I said, we are taking actions and steps to realign our strategy to focus on our proven, durable income streams. We are recycling capital out of non-core investments, including our operating portfolio to monetize lower-growth communities and remaining disciplined and deliberate in pursuing only the highest growth capital expenditure projects. As we implement these rate sizing activities in the coming quarters, we are optimistic the market will recognize how these activities will decrease our leverage and target a return to the consistency of our earnings we have long enjoyed. As always, the management team and I are grateful for the hard work and accomplishments of the entire Sun team this quarter and I would like to thank all the team members for their dedication and all of our stakeholders for their support. Fernando will now discuss our results in more detail. Fernando? I think underlying our goal to sell assets as we have shared with the market. It's just a use of recycling capital and paying down debt. Generally, these are all high quality assets and they are performing in the portfolio. But for various reasons, we think that bringing them to market and being able to pay down higher priced debt would be favorable as we go forward. So in North America, we have shared we have done a kind of deep dive and identified some assets to bring to market. Those first group of assets are either currently or in the next week will be marketed and we will determine at that time, how the market feels in North America. As everyone is aware, there's been very, very little transaction in the manufacturing RV market. So it -- there are no data points to point to right now. We know that rates are significantly up, but these are good high quality assets. So we look forward to being able to share with you on our next call or if we are able to execute on anything before our next call, how the market is responding to those assets. With regard to the U.K., in particular, those that are collateralized by the Royale loan -- RoyaleLife assets, because we are in the receivership period, there's really little that we can comment on. But during the receivership period, we are in dialogue with optionality on those assets and will continue to be so. And then we talked about Sandy Bay, it's a really high quality premier asset, 730 sites with a big expansion piece to it and we are in dialogue with a number of people regarding a potential sale there as well. So we will be very pleased to be able to share with everybody what the market is looking like as we began the first steps of marketing. Yeah. I think it speaks to how we have shared with our stakeholders over 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years of business, kind of the slow marathon over the Sprint and our approach to want to be able to really get outsized growth above inflation. When inflation is low and when inflation is high, last year, we got off 7.2%, 7.3% rental increase. So we really are enjoying heavy, heavy demand and want to continue to see it continue. So we think that we have really set the rent in a way that over a long period of time, we will be able to maintain NOI growth in excess of inflation, and at the same time, retain high occupancy. So after a couple of years of tremendous growth, we look forward to continuing that growth and set the rental rate very thoughtful for 2024. Yeah. I will take the first part and Fernando wants to add anything. I think we have been very, very clear that with regard to use of capital and our free cash flow, the most highest priority and best use for that free capital will be to reduce leverage. As we look at this high capital cost environment that we are in right now, recognizing that we do get very, very strong IRRs on expansion usually in the 10% to 13% range. I mentioned RV and new development on the high single double-digit, those are IRRs and they do take a period of time, they are initially dilutive. So by putting those things on hold moving forward, our expectation is that in a better economic environment. We have the inventory of sites on hand and we can resume our expansion and development activities. So as it stands right now and we will share exact numbers as we go forward in guidance for 2024. The expectation is to have a very limited capital investment in the development area and it's just a fact from where we are sitting and see the cost of capital right now. And with regards to home sales volume, again, in the U.K. we have the sites, we have the homes. The U.K. Park Holidays team is doing a remarkable job. We are very, very pleased with how home sales are continuing, although they are guided down from the beginning of the year and we will be able to share those guidance post with 2024 guidance. Yeah. I think that based on what we have shared we have had third-party appraisers throughout the process at the beginning, and as recently as June 1st, provide appraisals and the overall appraisals, I think, last came out about 80%. Thank you. Brad, our expectation is with 90%-plus of our revenue being derived from those real property operations and with the fact that 30% to 40%, maybe by year-end close to 50%. Those rental rate increases will all be out there with good expense control, should continue to see the benefit of high occupancy, solid rental increases and expense control, as Fernando just referred to. Yeah. I think, I don't know if that was directed to me or to Fernando, but I will start out with it. I mean, summarizing you are exactly correct. The steps that we are thinking about, the fact that we have shared, we stopped new development and the acquisition, continuing converting transient to annual or when you think about those conversions in the last three years, we have actually converted about 20% of our transient sites or will have by the end of this year to annual leases and we will continue to do so. As Fernando mentioned, we sold our stock position in Ingenia, all looking to recirculate more free cash flow and capital to pay down debt and demonstrating the operational leverage, which you are referring to, is something we are very hyper focused on for 2024. We have continued to see a slowdown and even minor reduction in the growth that we have seen for the last five years, seven years, and certainly, for the last two years, three years as we brought these portfolios in. And Eric, we are working really hard and look forward to sharing with you the outlook for 2024. As we have owned the portfolios and will have owned the portfolios for two years to three years and I think that, that will also underscore how we are able to deliver bottomline FFO growth moving forward. That is what I am referencing. It is our goal to be able to share the 2024 expectations for G&A and to have created leverage moving forward. Yeah. Sure. First of all, I'd say that we are very pleased with our relationship with the Ingenia folks and we set out to have this JV Sungenia in 2018 and while we sold our entire investment in the Ingenia stock, they are great partners in the Sungenia development and we don't have to -- we do no longer have someone on the overall Board. We are able to allow them to focus on the day-to-day management and operations of the development and the fact of the matter is that after all that time and the investment, the work that's now completed and the backdrop of demand in Australia for retirement housing, the near-term returns are very attractive and we are very positive about the cash flow over the next 12 months. Again, that's something we will be able to lay out in 2024. So, we have invested five years for what is expected in 2024 and I think that that will be pretty clearly laid out as we provide guidance and then we can talk about thoughts going forward from there. Yeah. Yeah. I think that after two years of ownership of the Marinas and the 7.3% rental increase last year and seeing the demand, as I said, what Sun's always focused on is the ability to give sustain -- sustainable returns year-after year-on a same community basis and the fact of the matter is that a lot of thought and dialogue went into that rental increase. So that in the coming years, we will be able to look for continued long-term growth in the same way, as we had in our MH and RV portfolios. We don't have much marked lease pickup, just because there's very, very little turnover, well, I will say, in our MH and annual RV portfolio as well as our Marinas. So on the MH side, not to drift, but to share with you 15-year average turnover nearly 98% occupancy, less than 0.5% of the homes move out a year and the fact that we don't have many leases that are directly tied to CPI or any long-term leases. So our market rents or our current rents seem to be pretty close by standard to market and we feel the same is true on the Marinas side and we have always shared that an empty site or in this case, in the Marinas and empty slip is the most costly slip that we have. So as we look for providing solid performance in 2024, we arrived at the 5.6% increase and it does really not provide for very much, if any market -- mark-to-mark rental increase at all as does the rest of our portfolio. You bet. Yeah. I don't have the occupancy uplift for 2023. Of course, 2024 will give that thought as part of the guided range, but... Well, we acquired a really high quality premier manufactured housing community in the U.K. in late 2021 and as we move forward with the RoyaleLife Group and determined that we would provide them a note for them to pay us back with that loan. They were also working with a group that was interested in acquiring Sandy Bay and we shared with the market at that time. It was an offer we were willing to accept, as we are looking to really reduce our capital commitments in the U.K. And as completely separate from RoyaleLife and completely separate from Park Holidays. We agreed and entered into a contract with that group to sell Sandy Bay. And now that, that's not moving forward, we will continue to operate it and hold it for sale and recognize the income. It's about 730 existing sites with expansion potential of 450 and -- that's what I had shared earlier. Yeah. I can't comment too much on RoyaleLife other than the same things that everyone is aware of that they have been taken under certain aspects of it have been taken under receivership and the recapitalization, as I understand it, is certainly stalled, if not terminated at this time. Yeah. On the Sandy Bay, I think, it -- as we have shared, it just was, it's very high quality, very high-profile property. The fact of the matter is that we determined we did not want to increase our capital exposure in the U.K., and therefore, took the offer and the opportunity to put it up for sale and we will continue to market it, and as I said during the income, as that process goes forward. So nothing particular about that. In North America, I think, what we shared before is, we did sort of a deep dive looking for where we can recycle capital. We looked at all of our properties, and the fact of the matter, we have some properties, where they are in a single location, we probably expected to be able to acquire more properties in the area, but the fact of the matter is, they are not efficient to operate without more properties in the area. So those are the candidates. And then we have some smaller properties, that really don't fit the size of the company right now in the way that we operate. So those are the types of things that fall in the bucket. They are all performing, they are not cats and dogs, and we just selectively bucketed those opportunities to recycle capital. As I said before, they are not related to Park Holidays. They are separate and distinct and it was management. Well, John, I think, it's important to understand that, first of all, the management team is doing very well there. And the growth and reliability the real property income is achieving management's goals, although home sales and the challenging environment aren't and there's been a big focus by stakeholders. Who clearly are focused on home sales and how they are lower than we originally guided to and the fact that it's not the business or the percentage that we wanted to be able to contributing income. But we acquired the portfolio in a much different economic environment. When we took the opportunity in what was a strong economy to increase our manufactured home holdings by acquiring Park Holidays. The properties are themselves are excellent and we do believe in the business and the team. That being said, unfortunately, the opportunity in the U.K. has been impacted by really strong economic headwinds, even though the core of the business is performing. So with that being said, in very challenging times, we continue to really review all of our options, but we are very supportive of what the team is accomplishing there and we are very aware of those people, who have shared with us their thoughts on the capital invested in the U.K. Our goal really... Our goal really is to maximize value for that investment and as we continue to perform and view the U.K., we are happy to share any thoughts that we have moving forward. So I am going to suggest we are going into the market next week with the first group and it would be best if we are able to report realize market data and not interfere with the process that's taking place as we go out to the market. Okay. Thanks. I am only going to suggest that there is a tremendous effort from the Board of Directors down to management to make sure that we provide as much transparency as we can. So that those type of surprises, although they weren't economic headwinds in the U.K. came about very, very fast and had obviously dramatic impacts on these things that you are referencing. But I think what you are finding is that everything is clearly in disclosure and clearly open to discussion by the management team and we want nothing more than to be as transparent as possible. So that there aren't any surprises going forward. I think that speaking to some communities, which has been public for 30 years. We have business lines that all have the same underlying fundamentals of high demand against very short supply and MH certainly affordable housing, which drives the high occupancies that historically performed very, very well in all economic times. And so when we share the fact that we have been able to get rental rate increases in excess of inflationary pressure throughout our history and have never delivered as a company, a fourth quarter period, where we didn't have positive NOI growth. Our expectation and our goal with everything we are doing, with the rental increases, with the priorities that I shared with everybody, with the focus of the strategy that we have been implementing is to continue to get that same kind of same community growth and I have a drop down in an FFO per share basis to our shareholders. So I think, historically, one has to look to how we performed and what we see as the outlook for certainly the rental rate increases that we have going forward and the high occupancies and demand is that we should be able to continue to grow and provide growth as we have historically done as a company. So we are optimistic about moving forward and we certainly have a lot of steps that we identified that we are taking to secure that kind of growth. Yeah. I think it's very, very limited scope. There will be certain expansions where there's high demand in some of our MH communities and actually a backlog of potential sales. So some small expansion opportunity. And then, in Marinas, where we identify a great opportunity that provide 10% to 13% rapid returns on investments, reconfiguration of slips and other small expansions that we can do. Those are the type of areas that we will be focusing on. I think they are a select small group, as I said, both small and large assets that would be high quality assets and my expectation is they would qualify for agency loans. Yeah. I think that that's something that is going to come out of the work that's being done with the receivership, and at this time, there's very little we can comment about those properties. But it is all inclusive of the third-party appraisals that we had done and so it is included to get to that value. But what I would suggest the vast majority is the value of the properties themselves and the entitlement. Yeah. I think we would share that when we provide guidance. Thank you. Well, for those of you who are still on, we appreciate your patience and we really do look forward to providing full guidance for 2024 fourth quarter earnings call and I look forward to speaking to everybody then. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Third quarter core FFO of $2.57 per share was $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range. Expense savings at the property and corporate level were the primary contributor to outperformance as compared to our midpoint. Sun's total same-property NOI for the quarter increased 6.7% as compared to last year, outperforming the high end of our guidance by 220 basis points. Our performance was driven by same-property revenue growth of 5.5% and lower-than-expected property operating expense growth of 3%. For the quarter, same-property manufactured housing NOI increased 8%, driven by a rental rate increase of 6.1%, continued occupancy gains and focus on expense management. RV same-property NOI grew 4.1% due to an 8.8% increase in weighted average annual rental rate, approximately 2,100 transient to annual site conversions over the trailing 12 months and ongoing operational programs to mitigate expense growth. These were partially offset by a 4.4% decline in transient RV revenues, as transient occupancy normalizes. Adjusting for the decrease in sites converted to annual, transient revenue grew 2.2% relative to the prior year period. Over the Labor Day holiday weekend, same-property transient RV revenue was down 1.5%, as compared to last year's holiday weekend. Adjusting for the 5.7% decrease in transient sites converted to annual, transient RV revenue increased by 4.4%. We continue to drive the pace of transient to annual RV lease conversions to increase our percent of sticky revenues. This quarter, we converted nearly 540 sites to annual leases, for a year-to-date total of over 1,800 conversions. In Marinas, same-property NOI increased 8.9% in the third quarter as compared to 2022, an 8.4% increase in revenues highlights the strong demand to be part of our network. Our performance was due to solid rental rate increase, longer stays by guests in our Southeastern Marinas and operating expense savings, particularly within payroll and utilities. In the U.K., real property NOI for the quarter of $29 million was in line with our guidance. Retention rates among our U.K. owners is holding steady. With an average resident tenure that approaches eight years. The increased retention over 2022 was a meaningful driver of real property income growth this year. Turning to home sales. North American home sales contribution was broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter, where lower volume was offset by higher margins. In the U.K., despite economic headwinds continuing to challenge home sales volumes, we sold 2,310 homes through the end of the third quarter. Fourth quarter to-date, we have sold 204 homes, leaving approximately 300 homes to be sold to achieve our full year volume guidance. In terms of NOI, we are on track to achieve the midpoint of prior guidance, which approximates just over $70 million for the full year. Regarding our balance sheet, since our last call, we have focused on decreasing leverage and variable rate debt. During and subsequent to the third quarter, we entered into $150 million of SOFR swaps on our U.S. dollar line of credit at a fixed SOFR rate of 4.8% through April 2026. As Gary discussed, we sold our position in Ingenia and used the net proceeds of approximately $100 million to pay down borrowings on our line of credit. Additionally, we refinanced approximately $118 million of secured debt that was maturing this year with approximately $250 million of new secured debt. Adjusted to include the positive impact of a $50 million SOFT swap executed in March, the new loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.25% and mature in 2030. Taking this activity into account, we had $7.6 billion in debt outstanding at a weighted average rate of 4.15% and had a weighted average maturity of approximately seven years. Our trailing 12-month leverage ratio was 6 times and approximately 14% of our debt is floating. Turning to guidance for the year. We are revising our full year core FFO per share guidance downward by 1% at the midpoint to a range of $7.05 to $7.13 and establishing a fourth quarter core FFO per share guidance range of $1.28 to $1.36. Our revised guidance for the year is driven primarily by, higher expected interest expense in the fourth quarter, related primarily to the U.K. note remaining outstanding, U.K. home sales NOI performing towards the midpoint of our range and lower expectations for transient revenue in the U.S. Regarding the U.K. note, through the first nine months of this year, we recognized $28 million or approximately $0.22 per share in interest income. There is no interest income from this note in fourth quarter guidance. We previously expected to pay down debt with the notes repayment, which would have generated roughly $5 million or approximately $0.04 a share of interest expense savings in the fourth quarter. For U.K. home sales, we expect to finish the year within our prior guidance range, with home sales volume of around 500 units in the fourth quarter. We are forecasting lower margins on these home sales as U.K. consumers continue to favor pre-owned homes and part exchanges to new home. NOI margins on U.K. home sales for the first nine months averaged $26,000 and our revised guidance assumes average NOI margins of approximately $20,000 per home in the fourth quarter. Our same property portfolio is by far the largest driver of our results, representing over 90% of NOI. Based on results to-date and our expectations for continued strong demand, bolstered by effective expense management, we are increasing total same-property NOI guidance by 50 basis points from 5.7% growth at the midpoint of the prior range to a new midpoint of 6.2%. The increase is based on higher expectations at our same-property manufactured housing and Marinas properties, partially offset by slower growth in RV addressed earlier. At the midpoint, the 5.8% to 6.1% NOI growth we now expect from MH is 45 basis points higher than the midpoint of the prior range. And our same-property RV portfolio, we now expect NOI to grow 3.5% to 4.2%, which represents a 15-basis-point decrease at the midpoint as compared to prior guidance. For same-property Marinas, we expect NOI to increase to a range of 10% to 10.3% for the year, a 165-basis-point increase from our prior assumed range of 8% to 9%. Additionally, and as Gary discussed, we are providing guidance on preliminary rental rate increases for 2024. At the midpoint, we expect to realize average annual rental rate increases of 5.4% for manufactured housing in North America and 7.1% in the U.K. We expect a 6.5% increase in annual rental rates for our annual RV portfolio and 5.6% growth in annual rates of cost Marinas. For additional details regarding our updated full year guidance, please see our supplemental disclosures. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through October 25th. Our guidance does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research anal assessments. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator? And Wes, to add to Gary's comments, we have inventory to sell on the manufactured housing side. By the end of the year we will be delivering nearly 1,000. We will have to deliver nearly 1,000 new sites across expansion and ground up development. So that would support the home sales volume or contribution to NOI here in the U.S. Where we would say, should be around what we expect to get this year. We will continue to look to move that percentage downward. Certainly, the immediate use of proceeds of free cash flow in 2024, as well as any proceeds from dispositions or other activities would be to pay down debt. Yes. Sure. Hi, John. About 70% is secured by real estate and the other $30 million by the operating companies. At the midpoint of value. We -- the loan is covered at 80%. No. That's not the assumption. The valuations do cover a wide range of scenarios in that analysis with our third-party providers and appraisers. So, no, that would not be the assumption. Sure. John, I would say, the primary driver has been in response to normalizing transient revenue growth and given normalizing occupancy, any variable expenses at the property level have been managed across payroll, supply repair and utilities. As it relates to our Marina portfolio, for example, we have some of the growth capital that we have invested have been in solar projects that are driving lower utility expense year-over-year for those properties. So, yes, much of that would be sustainable and the -- our expense control on the variable side is in response to topline. So we would continue to look to mitigate the impact of lower revenues, if that would be the case. Brad, you have seen operational leverage at the corporate level with more muted G&A growth and we believe any activity, as it relates to episodic capital recycling events, right, will reduce not just leverage, but then also any interest expense impact of growth, that we did see this year and was a large contributor to the flow-through from same-property growth not showing up in FFO per share growth. Sure. So by the end of October, just over 40% of our manufactured housing portfolio will have been noticed and those have been at about a 5.4% increase. They will be around half of the portfolio will happen notice by the end of the year. On the RV side, about 60% of our residents have been noticed at this point. In the U.K., 100% of residents have been noticed at this point. And Marinas, essentially our Southeastern or Southern Marinas have been noticed and the rest are rolling over time. Thank you. Hi, Keegan. Yes. There -- while there are various line items that contribute to that change, the primary drivers will be the re-measurement of marketable securities, which is Ingenia on a quarter-to-quarter basis, which accounted for about $0.06 and then any unrealized gain/loss on FX changes, again, in the quarter that accounts for 5 of them -- $0.05. Hey, Josh. The -- through year-to-date on non-transient income on the Marinas side has just -- has been just under 10% and our rental increase in the 7.5% range. So from a back of the envelope math, roughly 200 basis points of occupancy gain in that number. Hi, Michael. No. Ingenia would have nothing to do as it relates. Only as it relates to the pay down the $9 million loss recognized is essentially marking the value of the shares at the end of the third quarter at A$4.20 to our ultimate sale price of A$3.90. So that would not impact our guidance. As it relates to the guide, certainly higher interest expense, as it relates to the note not being repaid. There's some additional interest expense in there as well, but it's primarily the note on the Park Holiday side from a home sales perspective, we provided guidance in July with the high end of about US$75 million. We are expecting that to be closer to the midpoint. And frankly, we give guidance and we provide ranges and some outcomes, right? We have parts of the business that outperform and others that performs at the midpoint or to the low end. And transient mentioned in my remarks, transient revenue is down on a guide to guide standpoint where -- when we spoke in July, we were expecting about a 4% decline in transient revenues and we are now expecting about a 7% on for the full year. We will look to offset and mitigate some of that impact with expense savings as we have done in the third quarter. And then, Michael, as it relates to long-term leverage targets. We stated our goal is to be at 5.5 times and below from a leverage perspective. Pro forma for the Ingenia stock sale, we are -- on a trailing basis we are now at 6 times. So we will through free cash flow and then through these episodic sales we will look to get to and within that range. I think, Anthony, we are always on the lookout for efficiencies and there are certainly things we are learning as an ops team to run our properties more efficiently. But, certainly, there is flex, right, as it relates to the variable rate or the variable expenses with transient and we are looking at another very strong year of transient site conversions over to the annual side. We are already at 1,800 sites converted as of the end of the third quarter and our -- would expect that elevated level of conversions to continue into 2024, which will -- which does continue to reduce transient revenue as a percentage of total revenues for the portfolio. Sure. I just got back from London a couple of weeks ago with the initial meetings with the syndicate. The tone of the conversations is certainly more constructive than it was a year ago at this time and we are working through the insurance program as we speak with our broker and the syndicate itself. As we mentioned at NAREIT, we have not implemented significant changes to our historical insurance program and so that is something that we will be looking to do to mitigate the large increase that we saw this year of 40% across our MH, RV and Marinas business, but mitigating that increase year-over-year heading into 2024. As a reminder, our power program renews at the end of the year and so we will look to share with the market at that time once we have bound our coverage. Anthony, that move-out rate is a combination of manufactured housing and RV. So the -- what I can share is that as it relates to our manufactured housing portfolio move-out, rates are largely the same as they have been historically. We have seen some higher move-outs on the RV side. But as I shared a bit earlier, right, our 1,800 site conversions are a net number. So we are continuing to fill sites, fill vacancy as it relates to on the RV side and are implementing various strategies to look to lengthen that stay at our properties. That would be correct. Yes. Anthony, the comment would be that both Fannie and Freddie finance, manufactured housing across the quality spectrum. They also finance RV resorts that are beer mostly towards the annual side. Sure. Steve. 80% loan-to-value. About 60% Steve. Sure. Eric, no perspective, acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities are factored into our guidance. For the full year we are expecting interest expense to be somewhere between $328 million and $330 million. Yeah. The additional the land sale that was sold in February was at 100% LTV. So that would increase the LTV and some additional accrued interest would also increase the LTV there. So it would not be a measure of the collateral itself. Yes."

Having said that, I would like to introduce management with us today, Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Fernando Castro-Caratini, Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call to discuss second quarter results and our updated 2023 guidance. We are pleased to share Sun’s continued strong operating results. Core FFO per share of $1.96 for the quarter was in line with guidance, supported by strong 6.3% year-over-year growth in same-property NOI and 3.4% growth in recurring EBITDA. Our properties share the compelling fundamentals of resilient demand and low to shrinking supply, which when combined with the unparalleled customer services our teams deliver, historically generate high durable cash flow streams throughout economic cycles. Same-property NOI growth in the quarter exceeded the high-end of guidance by 150 basis points and was driven by solid revenue growth and the successful implementation of ongoing expense management. In manufactured housing, same-property NOI grew 5.7% compared to 2022, driven by strong rental rate growth and bolstered by occupancy gains. In RVs, same-property NOI growth of 3.2% reflected our continued focus on converting transient guests into annual residents, which increases our stream of stable revenue and improved operational efficiencies. At the end of the quarter, same-property adjusted occupancy for our combined MH and RV locations was 98.7%, a year-over-year increase of 170 basis points and reflects the resilience of demand for our properties. Additionally, across our total portfolio, we gained over 1,000 new revenue-producing sites during the quarter, which represents 9.4% growth compared to last year and brings total gains for the year to nearly 1,850 sites. Same-property Marina NOI grew 11.9% compared to the prior year, exceeding our expectations. The outperformance was fueled by robust demand for wet slips and dry storage from boulders who increasingly discovered the convenient unmatched locations in premium amenities offered throughout our best-in-class network of Marinas. On a trailing 12-month basis, our same-property portfolio generates 91% of total real property NOI and is a powerful engine for EBITDA and cash flow growth. We intend to remain internally focused on optimizing our embedded portfolio growth. By reinvesting in our properties and providing the highest level of customer service, we preserve and increased value for the residents, guests and members and help ensure predictable long-term revenue growth. Portfolio optimization includes completing select property expansions and in the case of Marinas stock reconfigurations to enhance property returns and to scale property operations. In the second quarter, we delivered over 100 expansion sites across 3 communities. In May, we published our 2022 ESG report, highlighting our significant achievements, including the expansion of our GHG inventory to cover Marinas and the UK and our Board’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions. These and other important initiatives reinforce our dedication to being responsible stewards of all resources toward a shared goal of improving the communities in which we live, work, and serve. I would like to thank all Sun team members who have been instrumental in our accomplishments in the first half of the year. As we progress through the second half of 2023, I look forward to realizing even greater achievements that will further enhance Sun’s platform and the value we deliver to all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our results in more detail. Fernando?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Gary. During the second quarter, core FFO of $1.96 per share was in line with guidance. Real property revenue growth as well as efficiencies in property and corporate level expenses drove the quarter’s performance, partially offset by higher interest expense. Our same-property results were solid as demand for our properties remained strong. Total same-property NOI grew 6.3% in the quarter as compared to 2022, which outperformed the high-end of our guidance by 150 basis points. Total same-property revenues grew 6.2% and exceeded property operating expense growth of 6%. The lower expense growth was broad-based with moderate year-over-year growth realized in payroll, utilities, real estate taxes and other expenses. Same-property manufactured housing NOI increased 5.7% during the quarter, exceeding internal expectations. Our performance was driven by strong occupancy gains bolstered by a rental rate increase of 5.7% and lower-than-expected expense growth, especially in payroll investments. In RV, same-property NOI for the quarter increased by 3.2%. We achieved strong 8.6% growth in weighted average annual rents over the prior year and operating expense efficiencies that resulted in modest 4.1% expense growth over the prior year. These partially offset a 6.1% reduction in growth in transient RV revenue. Our RV communities delivered solid results during the July 4 holiday weekend. Same-property RV transient revenue increased by 8.4% compared to 2022 even as we had 5.7% fewer transient sites available. July 4 fell on a Tuesday this year, whereas last year it fell on a Monday. Adjusting for just the Friday to Monday period, same-property RV transient revenue still increased by 2.7%. While we continue to see strong holiday and weekend demand during mid-week periods, transient RV revenue growth continues to moderate from recent record levels. Strategically, we remain focused on increasing our stable annual property revenues through increased transient to annual site conversions. In addition to increasing the percent of revenues derived from annual residents, conversions result in higher NOI margins over time by decreasing the higher level of variable expenses associated with transient guests. During the second quarter, we converted over 750 transient sites across our total RV portfolio, bringing first half conversions to nearly 1,300 sites. Since the start of 2020, we have converted over 6,000 transient sites to annual and we intend to continue driving transient to annual site conversions to optimize long-term returns. In the second quarter, Marina same-property NOI increased 11.9%. This outperformance was driven by a 9.2% increase in revenue from stronger demand overall and lower expense growth of 3.4% that significantly surpassed our internal expectations for mid single-digit expense growth. Lower expense growth was most significant in Marina payroll and benefits, utilities and supply and repair. In terms of home sales, we were in line with our expectations in North America and are on track to achieve our guidance. Continued demand is demonstrated by an average price for new homes of $210,000 and higher margins. In the UK, economic headwinds continue to impact vacation home sales. Home sale NOI margins, while 5.7% below prior year margins, were in line with our expectations. The approximately 840 homes sold in the second quarter were 8% below our expectations. Inflation in the UK has remained higher for longer than anticipated. And in late June, the Bank of England implemented an unexpected 50 basis point increase in its base interest rate. We have seen the time home purchasers take to buy a vacation home continue to lengthen and the margins on those home sales remain under pressure. Our experienced UK team continues to successfully navigate this challenging market environment with a focus on optimizing volume and margins while these conditions persist. On the real property side, we are seeing higher retention rates for Park Holiday homeowners, which leads to higher average resident tenure approaching 8 years. We remain enthusiastic about the growth opportunity in this segment of the business. As of June 30, 2023, our $7.6 billion in debt outstanding or interest at a weighted average rate of 4% and had weighted average years to maturity of 7.1 years. Our trailing 12-month leverage ratio was 6.2x. Based on our operating cash flow expectations for the remainder of the year and potential capital recycling opportunities, we anticipate deleveraging towards our long-term leverage target. As detailed in our supplemental, we are revising our full year guidance range for core FFO per share downward by 2.2% to a revised range of $7.09 to $7.23 and established guidance for the third quarter. Our revised guidance is primarily reflective of lower expected home sales in the UK and higher interest expense expected in the second half of the year, predominantly from the flexible variable rate sterling-denominated debt that funded our UK business. Since our last guidance update in April, short-term interest rates have increased meaningfully. We are evaluating opportunities to refinance and pay-down floating rate debt over the second half of the year. We expect continued strong same-property performance and are increasing our total same-property NOI growth for the year to a range of 5.3% to 6.1%. The 20 basis point increase at the midpoint is driven by outperformance in manufactured housing and Marinas moderated by revised expectations for same-property RV. We also expect additional G&A savings over the second half of the year. Our revised same-property NOI growth ranges for the year are 5.2% to 5.8% for manufactured housing, representing a 50 basis point increase at the midpoint, 3.4% to 4.6% for RV, representing a 100 basis point decrease at the midpoint. The largest driver for the decrease is revised growth expectations for transient RV revenue, which is now forecasted to be a 3.9% decline for the full year, 8% to 9% from Marina, representing a 110 basis point increase at the midpoint. For our UK operations, we are lowering our full year forecast for home sales NOI to a range of $65.7 million to $75.4 million. The revised range represents a $10.2 million decrease to prior guidance at the midpoint and assumes we sell between 2,800 to 2,900 homes for the full year, an approximate 11% decrease in volume from April expectations. For additional details regarding our updated full year guidance, please see our supplemental disclosures. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through July 26 and the effect of a property disposition under contract that is expected to close during the third quarter. Our guidance does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which maybe included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Dennerlein: Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. So, I guess this is the second time in a row you’ve taken down UK home sale profits and I think that volumes as well. What’s to say this is the bottom? And can you kind of walk us through how you forecast or come up with that guidance range for the home sales and the profit?\nGary Shiffman: Sure, Josh. Thanks. To really look at how we are thinking about the fact that we have had to re-guide before on the UK, I’d underscore that the home sales forecast has built really from the bottom up at the community level, taking into account all available sites to sell homes on, which include vacant sites, sites to be delivered from expansion activity and rental home higher fleet sites that we can convert to be able to sell homes and create an annual fee on. And this exercise is completed with a lot of oversight, but built up from the property level. Our revised range really incorporates current market conditions as we understand them. It doesn’t assume any major decline in inflation or interest rates in the UK for the remainder of the year. And we think even if we were to see them the lag between those changes and improvements wouldn’t impact results for the balance of this year, certainly, they would into ‘24. So the high end of our range currently indicates what we believe is the most likely of outcomes and the low end of our range really tend to catch that outcome further to what we would consider a worse case scenario. As Fernando mentioned in his remarks, since we met at NAREIT, certainly, the conditions since then have changed in the UK, much slower reduction in CPI, although there has been some modest reduction, but the Bank of England’s 50 basis point rate increase was unexpected and it does have ramifications on the buyers of our vacation homes. So from the best insight that we can see, we feel that we have done a good job really thinking through what the scenario should be through 2023 and that’s how we adjusted guidance and came up with a range.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. And then could you walk us through how most people finance or pay for their Park Holiday homes? And is there – do a lot of people use like a second lien on their primary home to pay for it?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. So Josh, about 30% of our homeowners are purchasing with financing that would be akin to channel financing here in the U.S. The other 70% we see it as cash. In some instances, they are right, using proceeds from refinancing their home, their primary home in order to purchase their vacation home. Certainly, rates are – refinancing rates are higher for primary homes. So, that’s going into the equation as far as lower volume expected of sales.\nGary Shiffman: And the only thing that I would add that in the UK, the single-family residential, primarily home mortgages and the fixed rate for a shorter period of time here in the U.S., 3 to 5 years, so certainly, those potential vacation homebuyers are experiencing a reset to their mortgage rates and that probably as they factor in line, we are seeing a slower conversion to buy homes from our potential customers. But the interesting thing I just would add is that the Park Holidays platform really continues to put a strong to market through the changes in Brexit, the location of the units, the work of the properties, the work from home that’s taking place there. So there is still – when we talk about the real property activity, still high demand, high tourism, high usage and the high anecdotal interest remains in buying homes, but it’s definitely influenced by a slower peso sales, because I think they are experiencing financial ramifications in the UK.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Yes. Thank you. Sticking with the UK home sales. Can you talk about what underlies the guidance for the rest of the year in terms of the ASPs and the margins compared to last year?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. So Brad, our 2,800 to 2,900 home sales expectations for the full year have us having a margin of between $24,000 and $25,000 NOI margin. As you see – as you would see it reported for us. So we do have a moderation to margin expected on a year-to-date basis. We have been achieving about a $26,000 margin.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then how do you think about what needs to happen for that business to recover? Is it just rates need to stabilize or go down? Does the UK economy need to improve? And how long do you think about that potentially taking?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. I like to think we had a crystal ball. And if we go on our assumptions, we would have thought earlier we would start to see some improvement, but that hasn’t taken place. Clearly, when you look through Europe, UK has the most challenged economy right now. I think the steps that have been taken by the Bank of England have begun to show some improvement in CPI, which was right around 10% a year ago. As recently as a little while ago, would drop to 7.9%. So it still has a ways to go. But I think as we see that improvement, we would expect there would be a commensurate rate decreases in conjunction with that over time. So as we look out into 2024, we think that’s one we will begin to see the change in realization that we go back to more normalized sales.\nBrad Heffern: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. [Technical Difficulty] Doing so well. Just curious, one, what you’re seeing on the safe harbor platform. Two, how you’re thinking about underwriting the long-term view of the space? And then three, what the marina performance does to your views on long-term capital allocation going forward?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Keegan, the first I would say 5 seconds of your question, 5 to 10 seconds of your question did not come through. Can you repeat, just start over.\nKeegan Carl: Yes. So just focusing on the marina business because obviously, the outperformance is really impressed, and I think people should be focusing on that. So one, given what you’re seeing in the Safe Harbor platform, how is that trending versus your initial expectations? How are you thinking about the long-term underwriting of the space because of this? And then what does it mean from a capital allocation standpoint going forward?\nGary Shiffman: I’ll start out, Keegan and just suggest that the Safe Harbor outperformance really was driven by strong demand for slip and dry storage rental across the entire board from small to medium, all the way to the superior. The peak season rate increases were passed through and occupancy remained very strong. We’re seeing increased demand for slips across the Board. And a lot of it, we really do attribute to the value of the Safe Harbor membership, which includes such things as an unmatched network of locations out there today to travel between best-in-class facilities and amenities for the members to use and really best-in-class customer service that we talk about. And then the perks like passing on fuel at basically our cost, we noticed that fuel usage is up 13% year-over-year on a per gallon basis. So some of the impact of R&D, which was a decision we made intentionally to sacrifice that margin is really paying a reward in the more important slip rental. So we’re very, very pleased at how things are performing at Safe Harbor Marinas and we’ve seen it in performance quarter after quarter. With regard to our long-term outlook, I think we have shared with you that capital allocation is fairly restricted at the company today. We’re very internally focused on using our capital in a very disciplined way within our portfolio as marina are a great example. We have identified 27 opportunities to reconfigure marina slips. And when we invested reconfiguring the slips, we get about a 10% to 12% return on that investment. Of the 27 opportunities, seven reconfigurations have taken place we are under construction right now and about 10 others are in the permitting process in three or four are still being worked on. So that’s where we will see capital allocation. If we are looking for external growth, it will be restricted to a really accretive opportunity in a situation like a Savannah, [indiscernible] marina, where strategically it has a lot of benefit to the network effect that we’re trying to achieve within the marinas. So I don’t know if you have anything to add. Hopefully, that addresses some questions.\nKeegan Carl: Can I just follow-up just because Fernando called out capital recycling is an opportunity. Is it fair to assume you might sell some MH RV assets and recycle the capital into that the higher cap rate, higher-return marina business? Is that the right way to think about it?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: I think that as we look at our portfolio and evaluate there is a bottom tier of assets, always when force ranking. So we will look to selectively and strategically look to recycle out of some properties that maybe aren’t meeting the long-term growth profile that we’re looking for. And today, any immediate use of that capital would likely go towards deleveraging. But certainly, we will evaluate all opportunities in front of us.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Thanks a lot, back into queue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question. \nNick Joseph: Thanks. It’s actually Nick Joseph here with Eric. Gary, if I think about kind of really over the last 10 years, I think the company has really benefited from a stability of results. And if we go back to kind of the guidance questions earlier. Definitely seems like things are a lot more volatile now. Obviously, part of that is probably the recent acquisitions. But at the end of the day, it’s missing guidance and calling into question kind of the forward guidance from here. So as you think about what do you think needs to change from the corporate side to forecast results more accurately? Are these just growing pains, I guess, with the UK and maybe some of the macro volatility that you cited. And ultimately, we get back to kind of how it was traditionally or is the range of outcomes just a bit broader given the new businesses?\nGary Shiffman: I’ll give you with some thoughts that I have and Fernando certainly can share his thoughts. But we have shared with our stakeholders that complexity is something we’re working very hard to reduce taking all the steps that we possibly can to get back to helping and assisting with the simplification in the modeling forward guidance. There is no doubt the headwinds we’re experiencing in the UK caused a lot of challenges with regard to guiding forward. And when we think about things, we use the best tools that we have at the time, whether it be the forward curve, whether it be meaning everything we can with regard to how we look on the economic challenges there. Obviously, we’ve had to reguide, so that makes things difficult. But all in all, when we think about 91% of the entire contribution from real property is what we’re trying to guide to. We have a lot of work to do in the UK that we’re working on. On the marina side, we’ve worked very, very hard to be able to put together the same site Marina data so that we can measure going forward. And I know that Fernando was disclosing in supplemental has been working to simplify a lot of things and kind of present a lot of benefits that can help the modeling. And I don’t know if you have anything you want to add from there. So we are very, very attuned and aware of the complexity that has been created in large part through the acquisitions, both Marina and the UK recently. And as a company that’s been around 30 years plus in the public marketplace. We’ve listened to our stakeholders that we’re very, very focused on step-by-step reducing that complexity and making the modeling and the forward guiding as good as possible.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on that. What can you do to reduce the complexity kind of in the near, medium and longer-term, right? Is it selling the UK home sale business? Is it somehow restructuring it? How are you thinking about actually reducing that complexity?\nGary Shiffman: Well, certainly, one piece of it is the fact that strategically, we have shared with the market that our long-term goal in the UK was to deemphasize contribution from the home sales margins and focus on the very, very stickiness of real property contribution like we do in the U.S. and that was a kind of a 5-year strategic plan. We’re slowly making progress out there. Ironically, as a percentage with home sales down that real property side percentage is up, but we’re working on it over a long period of time. And I think that we’ve already increased the average stay in the UK to around 8 years. We’re expanding our licenses to stay in the UK properties for – from 20 years to 30 years. So we expect that 8 years to continue to grow and look more similar to the 15 year, if you will, in the North American manufactured housing. So deemphasized the margins on home sales and really focus on the real profit contribution, and we’ve taken similar steps in the Marina side to accomplish that as well as we convert some of the SRDE and take a service over to rental income from third parties. All that, I think, as we look out over a period of time, will help to simplify things going forward.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \nAnthony Powell: Thanks. Good afternoon. A question on, I guess, normalization of various leisure adjacent businesses. It’s been a topic of a lot of calls over the past few days. Transient RV and Marina, you’re still seeing growth in transient RV, I guess, on holidays, not necessarily midweek. And then marina has been pretty strong. Do you see any risk of normalization impacting these revenues in the next few years as people will turn to maybe more older habits post COVID.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Say, Anthony, I think we’re overall on the transient RV side, we’re seeing that normalization from record years over the last 2 to 3 years, given the bump over the second half of 2020 and into 2021. We are – we continue to see a lot of demand for our properties. I think you see that with the record number of conversions that we have having converted over 6,000 sites over the course of the last 3.5 years, which greatly outpaces what we were averaging on a per year basis prior to the pandemic and so now we’re taking that transient guest and they are choosing to stay with us for call it, on average, about a 5-year period of time and on an annual basis, getting a rental – predictable rental increase from our standpoint. On the Marina side, we’ve certainly seen very high demand on the transient side as well in the first half of this year, would say, right, we’re not underwriting double-digit transient growth for that line item. But I’ll remind our stakeholders, the percentage of rental income coming from transient. On the Marina side, it is much smaller, it’s about 5%, 4% to 5% of total rental income. So we have seen outperformance on that line item, but are not underwriting double-digit growth for over the course of the mid to long-term.\nAnthony Powell: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. \nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. So I appreciate all your commentary on Park Holidays and simplifying. But if you think about some of the other areas where you took down guidance, how do you create more visibility on that and simplify that. And then along the same lines, your credit line balance is up above $800 million. Can you talk about plans to either keep it there or refinance that to bring it back down?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thanks, Jamie. On the – we modestly brought down expectations on the SRDE side. That is, as Gary mentioned earlier, we are looking to deemphasize that over time as we, especially on the marina side, we convert the service business over to third parties paying us rent at the property level. So I think we will continue seeing that over time. And that ultimately will benefit real property NOI and rental income that we received, not just from our members, but then third parties that pay us rent to be at our properties to provide that service. As it relates to our line of credit, we have – we’ve mentioned over the course of the last couple of months, pursuing various strategic alternatives where – whether that’s capital recycling from operating assets that the immediate use of that capital would be to pay down debt. I think as you look towards the second half and into 2024, there will be a moderation in capital investments as well that we will convert more free cash flow towards deleveraging. But we are evaluating transactions in the capital markets as well in order to bring those balances down and de-lever towards our long-term target of being in the mid-5s.\nJamie Feldman: Okay, thank you. And if I could just ask a follow-up on that. So the interest expense guidance reduction, is that because you used the credit line and didn’t expect to or because rates are higher than you thought they would be? And if you did use it more than you expected, what was the reason for that?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. On a forecast-to-forecast basis, I would say primarily would be expectations from the forward curve, where in general, ending the year rates for both SOFR and SONIA are up on average about 70, 75 basis points from our last forecast in – at the end of April.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. So, it’s not balanced. It was really just forecast.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Yes.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. Alright. Thank you very much.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thanks Jamie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSamir Khanal: Yes. Good afternoon. I guess, Gary, just on maybe switching gears a little bit on the MH side. Pricing is still strong on that end. I guess how do you think about rent increases in the next year with inflation moderating here? I mean more of a question kind of into the next 18 months. Thanks.\nGary Shiffman: Yes. It’s a great question. Certainly, at overall 98.7% occupancy that makes annual, there will be the opportunity to continue to pass through all inflationary pressure. I would suggest that what we did last October in advance of providing guidance in February with fourth quarter and year-end results, we will again share with the market our forecast on rental rate increases across the board. But our expectation is that we will be able to pass through a solid rental increases throughout the businesses, and we will share those with everybody in October.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Hi. Thanks for the time. Fernando, I wanted to follow-up on the revolving credit facility question. I guess it’s been well over a year where you have leaned heavily on the revolver. So, why wasn’t that properly termed out long ago to more closely align the duration of the debt with your assets and when specifically should we expect you to lock in longer term financing?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: John, you will see us over the course of the next couple of quarters look to extend our maturities, not just what’s in our line of credit, but what is coming due from a secured debt standpoint. So, that’s something that we are actively working towards. But as far as bringing balances down, it’s really evaluating the multiple strategic alternatives that we have in front of us as far as being able to execute on those transactions and bring balances down. But we have been – since our initial investment-grade rating in the summer of 2021, we have been very active in the bond market having done about $2.2 billion of long-term debt between 7 years and 10 years of tenure. And our most recent transaction was back in January of this year, and that would be expected to continue over the course of the next couple of quarters.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then another question on Park Holidays, at your Investor Day over there, we toured properties with four or five of senior leaders from Park Holidays. Have any senior leaders left since left or retired who is overseeing day-to-day operations from the Sun mothership here in the States?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. John, generally, everybody is still there and there is a really well-seasoned team looking to work on pulling every single lever as they have these challenging economic times. So, that group of talented people are still there, and we are very pleased with the other.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Good afternoon. I had a question on Ingenia. If I am not mistaken, your development joint venture had a 5-year initial term that would be up for renewal later this year. So, I was wondering what your appetite is to keep it going, or could this be a potential source of funds?\nGary Shiffman: Great question. John, I think the fact is that technically, the Sun-Ingenia, as we call it, JV 5-year period of time is up at the end of November. We are always assessing our businesses, if you will, to remind everyone, Sun owns a 10% interest in Ingenia head stock. And we really have had a successful JV, which is performing. We are happy with the partnership relationship there, although there is no doubt, COVID and the pandemic, but kind of a 2-year crept in the plant. The Sun-Ingenia JV now has four developments, two are in fill-up phase and they are filling up nicely. And the other two are just about to break ground. With the JV expiring, we will continue to review how we will think about moving forward. But one of the factors is that as these four developments are moving forward, we want to make sure that we have the best opportunity to maximize those results once they are filled up and stabilizes. But we also are reviewing all optionality that relates to the capital recycling and the options that we can do to bring down some of our variable rate debt. So, we will continue to keep you advised as we think through how we are going to focus on the period of time where that does expected.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And if I could just follow-up on UK home sales. Just given the third quarter is the most crucial quarter of the year. Out of the number of homes that you had planned to sell for the third quarter, how many have already been sold or are currently in negotiations? And I was wondering how sensitive this is to mortgage rates. There was an article that came on the FT just a couple of hours ago of three of the largest UK lenders reducing mortgage rates. I am wondering if that’s been factored in at all.\nGary Shiffman: Yes. I would start to say that as I shared in the comments earlier, we are not sitting here anticipating the benefit of reduced mortgage rates or anything like that going forward, that would definitely be a positive, but we do think there will be a lag before we see the benefits of things like that. So, the underwriting that we talked about in the 2,600 to 2,900 unit range for the year is kind of our downside to our view in the market right now. And I don’t know, Fernando, do we have any information on how many sold in the third quarter?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: John, we will provide updates on homes sold over the course of the quarter when we meet during investor presentations and any other potential updates. But we are, as you identified, we are heading into a busy period as the holidays do pick up in August, and we will be able to report back to the market over the course of the next couple of weeks.\nJohn Kim: Can I just squeeze in one more question. The seasonality had shifted a little bit, but you also provided more clarity or more disclosure on the seasonality of UK home sales. Is this a good run rate going forward or roughly maybe third a fold in each of the second and third quarters?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Yes. The seasonality shift we would say, due primarily to the changes in volume, but yes, this would be the best run rate to use from a seasonality standpoint.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nWes Golladay: Hey everyone. I just want to maybe address maybe a few more of the moving parts that you may have in the future. Can you comment on the loan book? Is that mostly fixed rate, rate that you are charging, or is it floating? And do you expect the size of the book to stay the same over the next few years?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Wes, our wholly owned notebook, no portfolio is about $62 million today. That is in active repayment as residents make payments on their loans. We do have a joint venture where we are a 40% partner, where we are underwriting run rate, call it, $7 million to $10 million of financing per month as our residents finance their homes in our communities. So, that is fixed. Those are fixed rate financings. Chattel loan rates have historically been in the 8% to 10% range. Those haven’t moved significantly. There’ has been an uptick, but they are, call it, plus/minus at the high end of the range today for customers.\nGary Shiffman: I would always suggest with a slowdown of capital allocation to development of new sites, which is where most of the channel loan view is probably a reduction in usage as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Gary, earlier you were talking about the – how the UK, you are looking for a mix shift away from the NOI generated okay from the home sales and more from the rents in the second quarter our UK home sales. The quantity is up 11%, selling price down 11%. But have you been able to pass along greater rents along with the lower selling prices. So, maybe you get a little bit more income over the long tail as people pay their regular rents?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. When we talked about the UK management team, as they shared with us at one of our update calls recently, they are fully attuned with that strategy, and very, very focused on it. And we expect to see the ability to pass on those rental increases. And in fact, it’s a little bit accelerated right now as we adjust our home price margins to move volume in this challenging economic time and sell more homes and are able to put it on to the monthly real property fees. So, we expect to continue seeing that, as we said, strategically over the next 4 years, 5 years and would expect to see accelerated growth on the real property monthly fee side as we reduce operating margins – sale margins, sorry.\nMichael Goldsmith: And as a follow-up, are you able to kind of quantify if the increase in the rents is offsetting the pressure on the home sale? So, like are you just getting the back what you are losing in the near-term? Are you getting that back over time as part of the consisting cash flow, or is it just kind of a more careful balance as you navigate a pressured consumer and then over time you look to navigate it further?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. At this time, I think it’s the latter. First of all, it will be too soon to drop and share any conclusions at this time because we are just adjusting to a very challenging economic environment there. But we do believe over a period of time, just as we do in North America, we would sell a home at a very low margin to be able to create a sticky rent in one of our manufacturers housing communities that with less than 0.5% of homes leasing on an annual basis generally generate uninterrupted rent for 40-year, 50-plus-year period of time. And obviously, that predictable steady cash flow is what we are looking for because it does tend to get the better multiple and understanding that management and our stakeholders are looking for that over a period of time. We are very, very focused on achieving that and so is the team over there. So, we are aligned on that.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Hau with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Hau: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you guys talk about the trends that you guys are seeing on the holiday rental side in the UK. I heard that some of the competitors are lowering the rates. Just curious if you guys are doing the same thing as well.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Anthony, good question. We have seen the competition bringing down rates to capture demand, but we are actually seeing more holding rates fairly steady and our open market share from the market on that segment. And so that’s the outlook. That is the conversations that we are having today.\nAnthony Hau: Got it. And just a separate question, can you guys go over the current like RV, AMH and Holiday Park expansion opportunities and other initiatives such as solar arrays and slip configurations. It would be great if you can like quantify the size of each opportunity and also like the potential return.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Anthony, in any of these projects from an expansion or growth potential, expansion will typically be that AMH, RV, we will typically carry returns in low teens of 10% to 13%. Historically, that has been the case. Any solar arrays would vary slightly higher ROIs in the mid-teens from that standpoint. And then in the UK, any expansion opportunity carries a slightly higher ROI, call it, in the 20% range, given the payback period on building in, let’s call it, a home sale and the usage of the rental unit, it pays back much, much faster. We can – offline, we can go through in detail for any of these buckets, what the capital spend would be. But I think as we mentioned earlier, we are looking at each of these investment buckets as we head into 2024 and would expect a deceleration of spend as we focus on converting more free cash flow towards debt repayment, but we can review those buckets offline.\nAnthony Hau: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn it back over to management for closing remarks.\nGary Shiffman: So, we appreciate everyone joining us for our second quarter call, and we look forward to speaking on the third quarter and also sharing how we are viewing the implementation of rental increases going into 2024. Thank you, operator.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s – the company’s remarks. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call to discuss second quarter results and our updated 2023 guidance. We are pleased to share Sun's continued strong operating results. Core FFO per share of $1.96 for the quarter was in line with guidance, supported by strong 6.3% year-over-year growth in same-property NOI and 3.4% growth in recurring EBITDA. Our properties share the compelling fundamentals of resilient demand and low to shrinking supply, which when combined with the unparalleled customer services our teams deliver, historically generate high durable cash flow streams throughout economic cycles. Same-property NOI growth in the quarter exceeded the high-end of guidance by 150 basis points and was driven by solid revenue growth and the successful implementation of ongoing expense management. In manufactured housing, same-property NOI grew 5.7% compared to 2022, driven by strong rental rate growth and bolstered by occupancy gains. In RVs, same-property NOI growth of 3.2% reflected our continued focus on converting transient guests into annual residents, which increases our stream of stable revenue and improved operational efficiencies. At the end of the quarter, same-property adjusted occupancy for our combined MH and RV locations was 98.7%, a year-over-year increase of 170 basis points and reflects the resilience of demand for our properties. Additionally, across our total portfolio, we gained over 1,000 new revenue-producing sites during the quarter, which represents 9.4% growth compared to last year and brings total gains for the year to nearly 1,850 sites. Same-property Marina NOI grew 11.9% compared to the prior year, exceeding our expectations. The outperformance was fueled by robust demand for wet slips and dry storage from boulders who increasingly discovered the convenient unmatched locations in premium amenities offered throughout our best-in-class network of Marinas. On a trailing 12-month basis, our same-property portfolio generates 91% of total real property NOI and is a powerful engine for EBITDA and cash flow growth. We intend to remain internally focused on optimizing our embedded portfolio growth. By reinvesting in our properties and providing the highest level of customer service, we preserve and increased value for the residents, guests and members and help ensure predictable long-term revenue growth. Portfolio optimization includes completing select property expansions and in the case of Marinas stock reconfigurations to enhance property returns and to scale property operations. In the second quarter, we delivered over 100 expansion sites across 3 communities. In May, we published our 2022 ESG report, highlighting our significant achievements, including the expansion of our GHG inventory to cover Marinas and the UK and our Board's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions. These and other important initiatives reinforce our dedication to being responsible stewards of all resources toward a shared goal of improving the communities in which we live, work, and serve. I would like to thank all Sun team members who have been instrumental in our accomplishments in the first half of the year. As we progress through the second half of 2023, I look forward to realizing even greater achievements that will further enhance Sun's platform and the value we deliver to all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our results in more detail. Fernando? Sure, Josh. Thanks. To really look at how we are thinking about the fact that we have had to re-guide before on the UK, I'd underscore that the home sales forecast has built really from the bottom up at the community level, taking into account all available sites to sell homes on, which include vacant sites, sites to be delivered from expansion activity and rental home higher fleet sites that we can convert to be able to sell homes and create an annual fee on. And this exercise is completed with a lot of oversight, but built up from the property level. Our revised range really incorporates current market conditions as we understand them. It doesn't assume any major decline in inflation or interest rates in the UK for the remainder of the year. And we think even if we were to see them the lag between those changes and improvements wouldn't impact results for the balance of this year, certainly, they would into ‘24. So the high end of our range currently indicates what we believe is the most likely of outcomes and the low end of our range really tend to catch that outcome further to what we would consider a worse case scenario. As Fernando mentioned in his remarks, since we met at NAREIT, certainly, the conditions since then have changed in the UK, much slower reduction in CPI, although there has been some modest reduction, but the Bank of England's 50 basis point rate increase was unexpected and it does have ramifications on the buyers of our vacation homes. So from the best insight that we can see, we feel that we have done a good job really thinking through what the scenario should be through 2023 and that's how we adjusted guidance and came up with a range. And the only thing that I would add that in the UK, the single-family residential, primarily home mortgages and the fixed rate for a shorter period of time here in the U.S., 3 to 5 years, so certainly, those potential vacation homebuyers are experiencing a reset to their mortgage rates and that probably as they factor in line, we are seeing a slower conversion to buy homes from our potential customers. But the interesting thing I just would add is that the Park Holidays platform really continues to put a strong to market through the changes in Brexit, the location of the units, the work of the properties, the work from home that's taking place there. So there is still – when we talk about the real property activity, still high demand, high tourism, high usage and the high anecdotal interest remains in buying homes, but it's definitely influenced by a slower peso sales, because I think they are experiencing financial ramifications in the UK. Yes. I like to think we had a crystal ball. And if we go on our assumptions, we would have thought earlier we would start to see some improvement, but that hasn't taken place. Clearly, when you look through Europe, UK has the most challenged economy right now. I think the steps that have been taken by the Bank of England have begun to show some improvement in CPI, which was right around 10% a year ago. As recently as a little while ago, would drop to 7.9%. So it still has a ways to go. But I think as we see that improvement, we would expect there would be a commensurate rate decreases in conjunction with that over time. So as we look out into 2024, we think that's one we will begin to see the change in realization that we go back to more normalized sales. I'll start out, Keegan and just suggest that the Safe Harbor outperformance really was driven by strong demand for slip and dry storage rental across the entire board from small to medium, all the way to the superior. The peak season rate increases were passed through and occupancy remained very strong. We're seeing increased demand for slips across the Board. And a lot of it, we really do attribute to the value of the Safe Harbor membership, which includes such things as an unmatched network of locations out there today to travel between best-in-class facilities and amenities for the members to use and really best-in-class customer service that we talk about. And then the perks like passing on fuel at basically our cost, we noticed that fuel usage is up 13% year-over-year on a per gallon basis. So some of the impact of R&D, which was a decision we made intentionally to sacrifice that margin is really paying a reward in the more important slip rental. So we're very, very pleased at how things are performing at Safe Harbor Marinas and we've seen it in performance quarter after quarter. With regard to our long-term outlook, I think we have shared with you that capital allocation is fairly restricted at the company today. We're very internally focused on using our capital in a very disciplined way within our portfolio as marina are a great example. We have identified 27 opportunities to reconfigure marina slips. And when we invested reconfiguring the slips, we get about a 10% to 12% return on that investment. Of the 27 opportunities, seven reconfigurations have taken place we are under construction right now and about 10 others are in the permitting process in three or four are still being worked on. So that's where we will see capital allocation. If we are looking for external growth, it will be restricted to a really accretive opportunity in a situation like a Savannah, [indiscernible] marina, where strategically it has a lot of benefit to the network effect that we're trying to achieve within the marinas. So I don't know if you have anything to add. Hopefully, that addresses some questions. I'll give you with some thoughts that I have and Fernando certainly can share his thoughts. But we have shared with our stakeholders that complexity is something we're working very hard to reduce taking all the steps that we possibly can to get back to helping and assisting with the simplification in the modeling forward guidance. There is no doubt the headwinds we're experiencing in the UK caused a lot of challenges with regard to guiding forward. And when we think about things, we use the best tools that we have at the time, whether it be the forward curve, whether it be meaning everything we can with regard to how we look on the economic challenges there. Obviously, we've had to reguide, so that makes things difficult. But all in all, when we think about 91% of the entire contribution from real property is what we're trying to guide to. We have a lot of work to do in the UK that we're working on. On the marina side, we've worked very, very hard to be able to put together the same site Marina data so that we can measure going forward. And I know that Fernando was disclosing in supplemental has been working to simplify a lot of things and kind of present a lot of benefits that can help the modeling. And I don't know if you have anything you want to add from there. So we are very, very attuned and aware of the complexity that has been created in large part through the acquisitions, both Marina and the UK recently. And as a company that's been around 30 years plus in the public marketplace. We've listened to our stakeholders that we're very, very focused on step-by-step reducing that complexity and making the modeling and the forward guiding as good as possible. Well, certainly, one piece of it is the fact that strategically, we have shared with the market that our long-term goal in the UK was to deemphasize contribution from the home sales margins and focus on the very, very stickiness of real property contribution like we do in the U.S. and that was a kind of a 5-year strategic plan. We're slowly making progress out there. Ironically, as a percentage with home sales down that real property side percentage is up, but we're working on it over a long period of time. And I think that we've already increased the average stay in the UK to around 8 years. We're expanding our licenses to stay in the UK properties for – from 20 years to 30 years. So we expect that 8 years to continue to grow and look more similar to the 15 year, if you will, in the North American manufactured housing. So deemphasized the margins on home sales and really focus on the real profit contribution, and we've taken similar steps in the Marina side to accomplish that as well as we convert some of the SRDE and take a service over to rental income from third parties. All that, I think, as we look out over a period of time, will help to simplify things going forward. Yes. It's a great question. Certainly, at overall 98.7% occupancy that makes annual, there will be the opportunity to continue to pass through all inflationary pressure. I would suggest that what we did last October in advance of providing guidance in February with fourth quarter and year-end results, we will again share with the market our forecast on rental rate increases across the board. But our expectation is that we will be able to pass through a solid rental increases throughout the businesses, and we will share those with everybody in October. Yes. John, generally, everybody is still there and there is a really well-seasoned team looking to work on pulling every single lever as they have these challenging economic times. So, that group of talented people are still there, and we are very pleased with the other. Great question. John, I think the fact is that technically, the Sun-Ingenia, as we call it, JV 5-year period of time is up at the end of November. We are always assessing our businesses, if you will, to remind everyone, Sun owns a 10% interest in Ingenia head stock. And we really have had a successful JV, which is performing. We are happy with the partnership relationship there, although there is no doubt, COVID and the pandemic, but kind of a 2-year crept in the plant. The Sun-Ingenia JV now has four developments, two are in fill-up phase and they are filling up nicely. And the other two are just about to break ground. With the JV expiring, we will continue to review how we will think about moving forward. But one of the factors is that as these four developments are moving forward, we want to make sure that we have the best opportunity to maximize those results once they are filled up and stabilizes. But we also are reviewing all optionality that relates to the capital recycling and the options that we can do to bring down some of our variable rate debt. So, we will continue to keep you advised as we think through how we are going to focus on the period of time where that does expected. Yes. I would start to say that as I shared in the comments earlier, we are not sitting here anticipating the benefit of reduced mortgage rates or anything like that going forward, that would definitely be a positive, but we do think there will be a lag before we see the benefits of things like that. So, the underwriting that we talked about in the 2,600 to 2,900 unit range for the year is kind of our downside to our view in the market right now. And I don't know, Fernando, do we have any information on how many sold in the third quarter? I would always suggest with a slowdown of capital allocation to development of new sites, which is where most of the channel loan view is probably a reduction in usage as we go forward. Yes. When we talked about the UK management team, as they shared with us at one of our update calls recently, they are fully attuned with that strategy, and very, very focused on it. And we expect to see the ability to pass on those rental increases. And in fact, it's a little bit accelerated right now as we adjust our home price margins to move volume in this challenging economic time and sell more homes and are able to put it on to the monthly real property fees. So, we expect to continue seeing that, as we said, strategically over the next 4 years, 5 years and would expect to see accelerated growth on the real property monthly fee side as we reduce operating margins – sale margins, sorry. Yes. At this time, I think it's the latter. First of all, it will be too soon to drop and share any conclusions at this time because we are just adjusting to a very challenging economic environment there. But we do believe over a period of time, just as we do in North America, we would sell a home at a very low margin to be able to create a sticky rent in one of our manufacturers housing communities that with less than 0.5% of homes leasing on an annual basis generally generate uninterrupted rent for 40-year, 50-plus-year period of time.

            "content": "Thank you, Gary. During the second quarter, core FFO of $1.96 per share was in line with guidance. Real property revenue growth as well as efficiencies in property and corporate level expenses drove the quarter's performance, partially offset by higher interest expense. Our same-property results were solid as demand for our properties remained strong. Total same-property NOI grew 6.3% in the quarter as compared to 2022, which outperformed the high-end of our guidance by 150 basis points. Total same-property revenues grew 6.2% and exceeded property operating expense growth of 6%. The lower expense growth was broad-based with moderate year-over-year growth realized in payroll, utilities, real estate taxes and other expenses. Same-property manufactured housing NOI increased 5.7% during the quarter, exceeding internal expectations. Our performance was driven by strong occupancy gains bolstered by a rental rate increase of 5.7% and lower-than-expected expense growth, especially in payroll investments. In RV, same-property NOI for the quarter increased by 3.2%. We achieved strong 8.6% growth in weighted average annual rents over the prior year and operating expense efficiencies that resulted in modest 4.1% expense growth over the prior year. These partially offset a 6.1% reduction in growth in transient RV revenue. Our RV communities delivered solid results during the July 4 holiday weekend. Same-property RV transient revenue increased by 8.4% compared to 2022 even as we had 5.7% fewer transient sites available. July 4 fell on a Tuesday this year, whereas last year it fell on a Monday. Adjusting for just the Friday to Monday period, same-property RV transient revenue still increased by 2.7%. While we continue to see strong holiday and weekend demand during mid-week periods, transient RV revenue growth continues to moderate from recent record levels. Strategically, we remain focused on increasing our stable annual property revenues through increased transient to annual site conversions. In addition to increasing the percent of revenues derived from annual residents, conversions result in higher NOI margins over time by decreasing the higher level of variable expenses associated with transient guests. During the second quarter, we converted over 750 transient sites across our total RV portfolio, bringing first half conversions to nearly 1,300 sites. Since the start of 2020, we have converted over 6,000 transient sites to annual and we intend to continue driving transient to annual site conversions to optimize long-term returns. In the second quarter, Marina same-property NOI increased 11.9%. This outperformance was driven by a 9.2% increase in revenue from stronger demand overall and lower expense growth of 3.4% that significantly surpassed our internal expectations for mid single-digit expense growth. Lower expense growth was most significant in Marina payroll and benefits, utilities and supply and repair. In terms of home sales, we were in line with our expectations in North America and are on track to achieve our guidance. Continued demand is demonstrated by an average price for new homes of $210,000 and higher margins. In the UK, economic headwinds continue to impact vacation home sales. Home sale NOI margins, while 5.7% below prior year margins, were in line with our expectations. The approximately 840 homes sold in the second quarter were 8% below our expectations. Inflation in the UK has remained higher for longer than anticipated. And in late June, the Bank of England implemented an unexpected 50 basis point increase in its base interest rate. We have seen the time home purchasers take to buy a vacation home continue to lengthen and the margins on those home sales remain under pressure. Our experienced UK team continues to successfully navigate this challenging market environment with a focus on optimizing volume and margins while these conditions persist. On the real property side, we are seeing higher retention rates for Park Holiday homeowners, which leads to higher average resident tenure approaching 8 years. We remain enthusiastic about the growth opportunity in this segment of the business. As of June 30, 2023, our $7.6 billion in debt outstanding or interest at a weighted average rate of 4% and had weighted average years to maturity of 7.1 years. Our trailing 12-month leverage ratio was 6.2x. Based on our operating cash flow expectations for the remainder of the year and potential capital recycling opportunities, we anticipate deleveraging towards our long-term leverage target. As detailed in our supplemental, we are revising our full year guidance range for core FFO per share downward by 2.2% to a revised range of $7.09 to $7.23 and established guidance for the third quarter. Our revised guidance is primarily reflective of lower expected home sales in the UK and higher interest expense expected in the second half of the year, predominantly from the flexible variable rate sterling-denominated debt that funded our UK business. Since our last guidance update in April, short-term interest rates have increased meaningfully. We are evaluating opportunities to refinance and pay-down floating rate debt over the second half of the year. We expect continued strong same-property performance and are increasing our total same-property NOI growth for the year to a range of 5.3% to 6.1%. The 20 basis point increase at the midpoint is driven by outperformance in manufactured housing and Marinas moderated by revised expectations for same-property RV. We also expect additional G&A savings over the second half of the year. Our revised same-property NOI growth ranges for the year are 5.2% to 5.8% for manufactured housing, representing a 50 basis point increase at the midpoint, 3.4% to 4.6% for RV, representing a 100 basis point decrease at the midpoint. The largest driver for the decrease is revised growth expectations for transient RV revenue, which is now forecasted to be a 3.9% decline for the full year, 8% to 9% from Marina, representing a 110 basis point increase at the midpoint. For our UK operations, we are lowering our full year forecast for home sales NOI to a range of $65.7 million to $75.4 million. The revised range represents a $10.2 million decrease to prior guidance at the midpoint and assumes we sell between 2,800 to 2,900 homes for the full year, an approximate 11% decrease in volume from April expectations. For additional details regarding our updated full year guidance, please see our supplemental disclosures. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through July 26 and the effect of a property disposition under contract that is expected to close during the third quarter. Our guidance does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which maybe included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator? Sure. So Josh, about 30% of our homeowners are purchasing with financing that would be akin to channel financing here in the U.S. The other 70% we see it as cash. In some instances, they are right, using proceeds from refinancing their home, their primary home in order to purchase their vacation home. Certainly, rates are – refinancing rates are higher for primary homes. So, that's going into the equation as far as lower volume expected of sales. Sure. So Brad, our 2,800 to 2,900 home sales expectations for the full year have us having a margin of between $24,000 and $25,000 NOI margin. As you see – as you would see it reported for us. So we do have a moderation to margin expected on a year-to-date basis. We have been achieving about a $26,000 margin. Keegan, the first I would say 5 seconds of your question, 5 to 10 seconds of your question did not come through. Can you repeat, just start over. I think that as we look at our portfolio and evaluate there is a bottom tier of assets, always when force ranking. So we will look to selectively and strategically look to recycle out of some properties that maybe aren't meeting the long-term growth profile that we're looking for. And today, any immediate use of that capital would likely go towards deleveraging. But certainly, we will evaluate all opportunities in front of us. Say, Anthony, I think we're overall on the transient RV side, we're seeing that normalization from record years over the last 2 to 3 years, given the bump over the second half of 2020 and into 2021. We are – we continue to see a lot of demand for our properties. I think you see that with the record number of conversions that we have having converted over 6,000 sites over the course of the last 3.5 years, which greatly outpaces what we were averaging on a per year basis prior to the pandemic and so now we're taking that transient guest and they are choosing to stay with us for call it, on average, about a 5-year period of time and on an annual basis, getting a rental – predictable rental increase from our standpoint. On the Marina side, we've certainly seen very high demand on the transient side as well in the first half of this year, would say, right, we're not underwriting double-digit transient growth for that line item. But I'll remind our stakeholders, the percentage of rental income coming from transient. On the Marina side, it is much smaller, it's about 5%, 4% to 5% of total rental income. So we have seen outperformance on that line item, but are not underwriting double-digit growth for over the course of the mid to long-term. Thanks, Jamie. On the – we modestly brought down expectations on the SRDE side. That is, as Gary mentioned earlier, we are looking to deemphasize that over time as we, especially on the marina side, we convert the service business over to third parties paying us rent at the property level. So I think we will continue seeing that over time. And that ultimately will benefit real property NOI and rental income that we received, not just from our members, but then third parties that pay us rent to be at our properties to provide that service. As it relates to our line of credit, we have – we've mentioned over the course of the last couple of months, pursuing various strategic alternatives where – whether that's capital recycling from operating assets that the immediate use of that capital would be to pay down debt. I think as you look towards the second half and into 2024, there will be a moderation in capital investments as well that we will convert more free cash flow towards deleveraging. But we are evaluating transactions in the capital markets as well in order to bring those balances down and de-lever towards our long-term target of being in the mid-5s. Sure. On a forecast-to-forecast basis, I would say primarily would be expectations from the forward curve, where in general, ending the year rates for both SOFR and SONIA are up on average about 70, 75 basis points from our last forecast in – at the end of April. Yes. Thanks Jamie. John, you will see us over the course of the next couple of quarters look to extend our maturities, not just what's in our line of credit, but what is coming due from a secured debt standpoint. So, that's something that we are actively working towards. But as far as bringing balances down, it's really evaluating the multiple strategic alternatives that we have in front of us as far as being able to execute on those transactions and bring balances down. But we have been – since our initial investment-grade rating in the summer of 2021, we have been very active in the bond market having done about $2.2 billion of long-term debt between 7 years and 10 years of tenure. And our most recent transaction was back in January of this year, and that would be expected to continue over the course of the next couple of quarters. John, we will provide updates on homes sold over the course of the quarter when we meet during investor presentations and any other potential updates. But we are, as you identified, we are heading into a busy period as the holidays do pick up in August, and we will be able to report back to the market over the course of the next couple of weeks. Yes. The seasonality shift we would say, due primarily to the changes in volume, but yes, this would be the best run rate to use from a seasonality standpoint. Wes, our wholly owned notebook, no portfolio is about $62 million today. That is in active repayment as residents make payments on their loans. We do have a joint venture where we are a 40% partner, where we are underwriting run rate, call it, $7 million to $10 million of financing per month as our residents finance their homes in our communities. So, that is fixed. Those are fixed rate financings. Chattel loan rates have historically been in the 8% to 10% range. Those haven't moved significantly. There' has been an uptick, but they are, call it, plus/minus at the high end of the range today for customers. Anthony, good question. We have seen the competition bringing down rates to capture demand, but we are actually seeing more holding rates fairly steady and our open market share from the market on that segment. And so that's the outlook. That is the conversations that we are having today. Anthony, in any of these projects from an expansion or growth potential, expansion will typically be that AMH, RV, we will typically carry returns in low teens of 10% to 13%. Historically, that has been the case. Any solar arrays would vary slightly higher ROIs in the mid-teens from that standpoint. And then in the UK, any expansion opportunity carries a slightly higher ROI, call it, in the 20% range, given the payback period on building in, let's call it, a home sale and the usage of the rental unit, it pays back much, much faster. We can – offline, we can go through in detail for any of these buckets, what the capital spend would be. But I think as we mentioned earlier, we are looking at each of these investment buckets as we head into 2024 and would expect a deceleration of spend as we focus on converting more free cash flow towards debt repayment, but we can review those buckets offline."

Having said that, I would like to introduce management with us today. Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Fernando Castro-Caratini, Chief Financial Officer. After their remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, management asks that you limit yourself to two questions, so everyone who would like to participate has ample opportunity. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our conference call to discuss first quarter 2023 earnings and our updated guidance. We're off to a strong start to the year as our first quarter performance extended Sun's track record of delivering reliable NOI growth, driven by our best-in-class properties, which supply is persistently constrained and demand remains resilient. Our focus on providing an exceptional offering for residents, guests and members, backed by a 10 of customer service in our properties is a value proposition that creates loyalty and durable revenues for Sun. Our first quarter results were stronger than we anticipated with $1.23 core FFO per share for the quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Our same-property NOI increased 6.7%, surpassing the high end of our guidance by 230 basis points, driven by strong performance across all three segments. Same-property manufactured housing NOI increased 5% compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to several factors, including rental rate increases, occupancy growth and expense savings. Same-property RV NOI increased 4.4%, driven by 6.2% revenue growth, primarily reflecting strong conversions of transient sites to annual leases. Following the unprecedented increase in transient demand during the pandemic, we continue to benefit from heightened awareness of RV vacations and anticipate continued strong demand for annual RV leases. We are capitalizing on this demand to grow our base of long-term durable rent revenues with these conversions. Same-property Marina NOI grew 15.1% in the quarter as compared to the same time last year. Marina outperformance was due to strong rental increases, higher demand that included longer stays by transient guests in our Southeastern Marinas and operating expense savings. Demand for attainable housing and for value-oriented vacationing remained high and drove same property occupancy for MH and RV, 190 basis points higher compared to the same time last year. At quarter end, occupancy was 98.6%. Sun's MH and RV annual revenue producing sites increased by 802 sites in the quarter, representing the highest first quarter volume ever recorded and a 20% increase from the same period last year. Transient RV conversions to annual leases accounted for 65% of the RPS gains, demonstrating the success of our ongoing strategic focus to grow our base of long-term residents. Development activity continues to contribute incremental value to our long-term growth. We delivered over 200 ground-up development sites and over 130 expansion sites. We also opportunistically added to our inventory of land for future development, which now represents a pipeline of approximately 16,000 sites. Currently have sufficient new home inventory available to meet the demand for the newly delivered sites. On the acquisition front, Sun continues to remain highly selective, and purchased two new assets during the quarter. We manufactured housing community in Michigan and the Savannah Yacht Center, a premier service-oriented Marina in Savannah, Georgia, with the services provided by third parties. Marina enhances our network, providing access to another strategic location for our members. We will be publishing our fifth ESG report in the coming weeks and are very proud of our team members for reaching many milestones in 2022. In the report, we highlight ESG achievements such as the Coastal Habitat Restoration Program we are piloting at Marinas in Rhode Island; our UK operations, maintaining their silver rating from investor and people and achieving ISO certification for cybersecurity. Our ESG framework score improvements and the expansion of our data coverage to include Marinas and the UK, demonstrate our company's commitment to being accountable to our investors, team members, business partners and the communities in which we operate. We are pleased with the strong start to a year and remain positive on our outlook. I would like to thank our team members for their enduring dedication and hard work. And with that, I will turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our results in more detail.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Gary. First, I wanted to call your attention to the supplemental disclosure changes you likely noticed in the document published after the market closed yesterday. We have made a number of updates that are aligned with how we manage Sun as a whole and are intended to help you analyze our business better and more quickly. Our goal is that you find these modifications helpful and we welcome feedback. Core FFO per share was $1.23 for the first quarter, exceeding the high end of guidance by $0.03. The outperformance was driven by higher than anticipated real property revenue in manufactured housing, which benefited from rental rate growth and higher demand for our rental program sites from RV annual revenues that benefited from conversions of transient sites and from stronger than expected demand at our marinas. Additionally, the quarter’s results benefited from higher utility rebuilds and effective expense management at the properties. At the same property level, outperformance throughout our portfolio contributed to the 6.7% increase in total same property NOI. Same property manufactured housing NOI grew 5% over the prior year, resulting from a 6.4% increase in revenues and 10.4% expense growth. The outperformance in revenues was due to a 280 site increase in MH revenue producing sites, which was more than four times the occupancy gains realized in the first quarter of 2022. In RV, same property NOI increased 4.4% for the first quarter with a 6.2% increase in revenues and an 8.1% expense increase. During the first quarter, we converted 524 transient sites to annual leases, which was ahead of our expectations. As we continue to execute on our strategy of converting sites and capturing more annual revenue, we expect to also see a related reduction in transient revenue. Marina same property NOI increased 15.1% in the first quarter consisting of a 10.9% increase in revenues and a 4.3% increase in expenses. Marina same property revenue benefited from stronger than expected transient demand, especially in the southeast and continued expense management. During the quarter, we sold 589 homes in North America, which exceeded volume and margin expectations. In the UK, real property NOI was ahead of expectations in a quarter due to higher owner retention. NOI from home sales was below expectations in a quarter due to lower volume and the increased mix of pre-owned versus new home sales. Turning to investment activity, we purchased the Savannah Yacht Center for $100 million and funded the entire purchase price by issuing convertible preferred OP units. For the manufactured housing community acquired for $7 million, we issued a combination of OP units and cash. As of March 31, 2023, the company had $7.5 billion in debt outstanding. The weighted average interest rate was 3.9%, and the weighted average years to maturity was 7.4 years. Our leverage ratio on a run rate basis is six times. Based on our operating cash flow expectations for the year, we anticipate the leveraging towards our 5.5 times long-term leverage target over the remainder of the year. In terms of new financing activity, since our last call, we completed two additional mortgage loans that raised $100 million of fixed rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of 5.7%. In total, during the quarter, we raised approximately $585 million of fixed rate debt and used proceeds to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility. Additionally, we swapped another 100 million pounds on our sterling denominated term loan to lock in a fixed all-in rate of 4.8%. At the end of the quarter, our floating rate debt was at 16%, which is in line with our internal expectations. Excluding our senior credit facility borrowings between now and the end of 2025, less than 8% of our total debt matures. We continue to look at opportunities in the financing markets to further enhance our balance sheet, including terming out debt and reducing secured debt amounts. As detailed in our supplemental, we are affirming our guidance range for core FFO per share for the year of $7.22 to $7.42, and establishing core FFO per share guidance for the second quarter of $1.90 to $1.98. We expect higher total portfolio, real property NOI growth of 6.1% to 7%, driven by additional NOI from first quarter acquisitions and from higher same property NOI growth. We also expect higher contributions from North America home sales total SRD&E and lower G&A expense to offset a lower contribution from home sales in the UK. We now expect total same property NOI to grow by 5% to 6% for the year, representing a 10 basis points increase to prior guidance. The increase is driven by stronger than previously expected growth in same property manufactured housing and marina partially offset by slower transient revenue growth expectations in same property RV. Our revised same property NOI growth ranges for the year are 4.6% to 5.4% for manufactured housing, 4.4% to 5.6% for RV and 6.8% to 8% for marina. For our UK operations, we are lowering our full year range for total real property and home sales NOI by roughly 10%. Do a new NOI range of $141 million to $148 million. For additional details regarding our updated full year guidance and second quarter expectations, please see our supplemental disclosures. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through April 26, and the effect of a property disposition under contract expected to close during the second quarter. But it does not include the impact of perspective acquisitions, dispositions, or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJosh Dennerlein: Hey guys. Thanks for the question. Just, Fernando, thanks for the color of the guidance. Just want to explore the UK NOI guidance range being lowered 10%. Could you just go into more detail on what’s driving that underlying change?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. Thank you, Josh. And good morning all. The drivers to the changes are actually an increase to expectations in real property NOI from the UK that’s increasing by about 9% at the midpoint or about $5.5 million. And a decrease in expected contribution from home sales of about 20% or about $21 million that would be for the full year. So that would have the impact of performance over the first quarter and then our revised expectations for the rest of the year.\nJosh Dennerlein: So was that strategy driven where you’re pushing rate harder and that’s why like the real property is up 9%. And then you’re just getting less home sales or just kind of square it? Yes, just trying to figure out like what’s driving the drop in home sales too?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Certainly, we’re seeing shifts in the strategy as far as stronger, as Gary mentioned in his remarks, stronger owner retention at the property level that is driving the increased expectations on the real property side. We did see softer demand in the first quarter from a volume perspective and as Gary mentioned in the mix of homes which carry different margin expectations.\nGary Shiffman: So, Josh, it’s Gary. As I did suggest that shifts to a quality pre-owned home. The price is lower and therefore the retail price is lower. The margin is similar to as it has been, but the contribution from a quality used home that’s just smaller than a new home. And we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the new home and we’re well aware of the backdrop of the economy in the UK and that effect as we think through guidance for the balance of the year.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. In that NOI range, like how much of that profit is like home sales and how much is it like real property? Just trying to think of like for modeling purposes, we should think about it?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Josh, in our updated guidance, the percentage split between real property and home sales is about 45% coming from real property and 55% coming from home sales.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay, thanks guys.\nGary Shiffman: Which is the shift over long term that we’re looking to make, but the results of what’s happening right now relate more to the economic environment there.\nJosh Dennerlein: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Derek Woo [ph] with Citi Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thanks. Yes, just wanted to follow up on that, because I think in March, you put out deck that showed that the UK operations were sort of expected to be in line for the year. So I don’t know, did something happen in March that it caused you to rethink it? And if I’m doing the math correctly, it sounds like you’re expecting like a 21 million decrease in home sales on cloud [ph] like original starting point of 75, I guess around there, 75, 80. So that seems like a pretty material decline. So just trying to understand sort of what would’ve changed in March that would cause such a large decline.\nGary Shiffman: Hey, Derek. I think back to the matter is the decline has been very, very recent. The time from putting a deposit to closing and a buyer making a decision has slowed down. Obviously, the economic headwinds in the UK are fact that CPI is still double digit and it has an impact on the home sales decision making. But at the same time overall the portfolio performance is quite strong as we indicated. The retention is high. Site fees have been collected for the year. The holiday bookings are very strong, and the ancillary business that comes with those holiday bookings has been strong. Easter was an exceptional holiday week that we’ve just experienced on vacation homes. But we are very cognizant and aware of the economy there and have adjusted the home sales as we look out to match what we’ve seen in this more recent period of time, which really did correlate with the March period of time. That being said, we can share that April we’ve been following closely and there’s been positive undertones, but taking an approach to how we want to think about going forward, we made the adjustment to the home sales moving forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. And then I guess, I don’t know, are you underwriting sort of similar assets today that have sort of a high home sales component? And I guess as you sort of think about sort of underwriting them, would you change anything in underwriting, but I don’t know, lower sort of multiple on that income stream or predict more variability there? Just trying to think if anything you’re seeing now would change how you underwrite the asset class longer term?\nGary Shiffman: Well, certainly, we are very, very focused on that underwriting and this is a time where basically we can focus more on integrating what we already have in the portfolio and extract, as we like to say, the low hanging fruit, develop out the sites and grow the existing portfolio. So as far as our appetite and our underwriting moving forward, it will be very, very disciplined. And as we always say, the pencil is very sharp at this time. So I wouldn’t look for any major acquisition opportunity. And I would just reiterate our initial underwriting perspective in the business was long term. And it remains long term. We think we have the right portfolio best in class, as a matter of fact. A demonstrated management team that has been through tough economic environments before and done well. And I think that we’re watching them adjust to this difficult market that exists right out there. So as it relates to moving forward on underwriting it is adjusted to reflect the current, what we believe is short-term impact of the market.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research.\nKeegan Carl: Hey guys. Thanks for the time. So starting in the same store property RV NOI, it was kind of material amount. Just curious what drove such a start change in such a short amount of time? I mean, I know you called out transient, but that should be offset by the conversion. So is it more top line or more expenses that are driving this? And if it is the former, how should we be thinking about the demand funnel right now at this time of the year relative to last year?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hi, Keegan, it’s Fernando. So the revised expectations on the same property RV side of 75 basis points at the midpoint equate to about $2.1 million of NOI from initial guidance provided in February. That will – that is primarily coming from the transient revenue line item where we have revised our expectations. In February, we gave guidance of about 50 basis points of growth at the midpoint for the year, given the strong number of conversions that we’ve made already and expectations for the rest of the year. And we did see some weather impact in the first quarter in California and in the southwest. That’s – those are the primary drivers. So the revenue – the reforecasted revenue expectations are offset partially by expected expense savings in that part of the portfolio.\nKeegan Carl: And just on the demand funnel, the second part of the question, how does it compare, if you’re looking at your transient bookings say month to date, how does it compare versus last year?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Versus last year, we’re from a pay standpoint, we’re running about 5% or 6% below last year.\nKeegan Carl: Okay. And then changing gears here, so you mentioned at a recent conference, there’s an opportunity for you guys to potentially readjust your insurance rate. Given what your peer recently reported regarding the renewal rate, how should we be thinking about some potential upside here to your insurance expense? And is that contemplated at all in your guidance range?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: That is not contemplated in our guidance range. Keegan, the fact of the matter is that fair and market rates have not really improved. We’re continuing our deep dive analysis of reviewing and analyzing our insurance needs in order to optimize cost versus risk. And as you might be referring to these options we view include adjusting our retention pieces and levels throughout the stack for various types of risk. More closely examining usage of our captive, which is virtually unused at this time, looking for our opportunities to work with new reinsurance groups. Although that’s been met with some headwinds because as we’re – I think all aware of right now. The overall insurance market is very, very challenged. So it’s just a continuing effort to improve the cost and examine that we have the right risk adjusted cost going forward. So we would share with the market any cost savings that we believe we have found going forward.\nKeegan Carl: Great. Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Same store expense guidance is down by about 120 basis points. G&A was adjusted down by $4 million. So can you talk a little bit about where you’re able to find the savings and just maybe overall the flexibility or pliability of the expense model of the business and your ability to adapt it to the changing environments to accommodate some of the slowdown on the revenue side?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. Thank you, Michael. The expense savings would primarily come from offsetting some of the revenue expectations on the transient RV side. That’s going to be the largest driver. But also we are – we did experience in the first quarter and are expecting for the rest of the year higher utility rebuilds which is decreasing our year-over-year expense on that side of the expense stack given increased focus on rebuilds to tenants, as well as, right, we’ve talked about this before, but our solar array projects of which we have 35 today and another 15 underway which ultimately will continue to save on electric expense as we deploy these projects. On the second part of your question on the G&A side, those expectations that bringing those cost expectations down is primarily coming from salaries and wages.\nMichael Goldsmith: Yeah. I assume that’s just from lower hours.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Correct. At the property level.\nMichael Goldsmith: Yes. Got it. And thanks for that. And then my second question is just yes, is on the marina business and kind of how it fits into the entire enterprise. We started kind of concerned about the marina business and how it performed during a recession. It seems like the results are – our expectations are improving and it’s becoming a larger part of the business as a whole. So maybe you can talk about a little bit about the approving outlook there and then just also how it fits into the entire portfolio and how that diversity can help you navigate the tougher times?\nGary Shiffman: Yes. I think that we’re very pleased with marina performance to date, not only the outstanding performance this quarter, but what we’ve seen quarter after quarter over the last two years. Our view is that having the benefit of the entire network gives us an advantage over all competitors. And it’s really showing in the demand for wet slips and dry slips is for virtually at full occupancy with waiting lists at many of the marinas. And we’ve had the strong benefit of strategically acquiring what we refer to as the international marinas that allow us to keep the boats that are very, very large in the Safe Harbor system. And especially on the transient side when these boats come in for repair work that they often would head across the Mediterranean for. We’re keeping them longer in our network as we’re able to provide the service for them. So the other thing I’d point to, we have opportunity in about 30 plus marinas to reconfigure smaller slips into larger slips. There are two being redeveloped this year. There are Lebanon for permitting process. So we can do that. And the advantage of this also is the ability to be able to charge higher linear footage rates for the longer boats and the greatest growth in the marina vessel businesses and boats 30 feet or greater, that certainly require the wet slips. So we have a nice opportunity there to continue to grow. And I think a lot of it comes from the fact that as we have acquired the marina platform, we’ve been able to invest for the long term making small capital improvements that are well received by the members, and therefore allowing probably a much larger share of demand to take place currently in the Safe Harbor network. So we look to build on the strength that we saw this quarter.\nMichael Goldsmith: Gary, what’s the return or IRR of a reconfiguration project like that?\nGary Shiffman: So when we invest for that type of CapEx, we look for a 9% to 12% return.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore.\nSamir Khanal: Good morning, everyone. Hey, Fernando. Just curious on the home sales contribution in the U.S. and North America. I think you gave a number of $19 million. What was that? What was that budget? What was that budget before? What was that forecast before? I’m curious what you’re seeing in the U.S. as it relates to home sales, and if that’s sort of similar headlines to kind of what you’re seeing in the UK?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. Our original expectations for home sales contribution in North America were about $17 million. So we are seeing increased expectations there. In the first quarter, we did see from internal expectations we saw more pre-owned homes sold than then budgeted at higher margins, which drove out performance in that part of the business as we – for the rest of the year, as we focus on right from a back to basics filling sites that we have just created in across expansion sites and our ground up development projects will – this is one of the levers we can pull to fill those sites. But we’re – home sales are performing strong over the course of the first three, four months of the year.\nSamir Khanal: Got it. And then, I guess Gary just in terms of transactions and acquisitions, I knew you did a 100 million a quarter. I’m just trying to think about what does that opportunity set look like today? Is that the right quarterly run rate to think about, or is that too optimistic when you think about marina’s RVs and MH? Thanks.\nGary Shiffman: Yes, it’s a great question. Certainly, cost of capital and the impact of – it has a big impact on transactions. When we think of MH, certainly, Sun has been one of the biggest consolidators. There is very little if any cap rate expansion that we’ve seen. In fact, we saw another couple properties trade with a three or sub three handle over the last two quarters. And we were looking and evaluating those – but they sold far inside of anything that we would’ve paid for them. So I think that moving forward, adjusting for the fact that there are much fewer acquisitions out there on the MH side. There’ll be kind of a [indiscernible] opportunity. On the marina side, we’re very, very focused on the growth that we’ve had, and we have the ability to be very, very selective okay. And strategically inclined to look at acquisitions moving forward. So I think it’ll be a quieter period of time on the acquisition side moving forward.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Yes, Samir I would add just extremely selective as far as the acquisitions that we did in the first quarter, the $7 million manufactured housing community, that was a near completed round of development that we bought in our backyard in Michigan that we will fill up quickly. Given that’s a tried and true model. The Savannah Yacht Center on the marina side, really this is a two plus two equals five as far as the – how it complements the network and being able to keep more of the business within the network itself, would also point to the funding mechanism for the Savannah Yacht Center, which was a convertible preferred operating partnership, the entire purchase price where we are, we did issue these securities and they would convert at a 30% – almost 30% premium to where we were trading at the time when we closed the acquisition. So certainly being very opportunistic and using the funding sources that are available to us in the market.\nSamir Khanal: Got it, thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the mortgage loans that you priced subsequent to quarter end at 5.7%. I was wondering if you could provide some characteristics on what asset or assets are associated with this debt? And what that means for cap rates?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: John, so these were – essentially, I'll use a nontechnical term, borrow-ups on an existing facility with GSEs where we essentially increased the LTV that had been – that had come down over the course of the last couple of years from a financing that we've done in 2019. This was done on manufactured housing assets. This was eight years of weighted average maturity for that financing. And it would be in line with, say, our unsecured borrowing rates today based on where the 10-year is and expected spread. But Gary earlier made a comment on expectations from a pricing perspective or manufactured housing. That haven't really shifted over the course of the last 12, 18 months, given the scarcity value of manufactured housing. We've seen little to no widening of pricing expectations for the highest quality manufactured housing assets that we own in our portfolio or that we would be interested in buying.\nJohn Kim: Okay. My second question is maybe a two-parter on your UK guidance. First of all, I wanted to make sure or ask if this was on a constant currency basis? Or does this include the new currency rate versus what you had previously? But secondly, there was a report recently that property surveyors in the UK had actually increased their outlook for the year on home sales. And I'm wondering if your reduced guidance is due to vacation homes not being directly correlated to the UK housing market or perhaps a lag effect given these are secondary homes for a lot of – for all the buyers or if we should not place too much emphasis on property surveyors?\nGary Shiffman: Hey John, we too are aware of how the valuers are thinking about things, but that is on the general homeowner market. And what we would suggest is that is very positive because those are the owners who are buying second vacation homes in the Park Holidays portfolio. So it is something that we'll just have to watch and it could be something that creates a positive impact as we move forward. We can only underwrite – so what we're seeing right now, we know that the CPI environment is 10-plus percent there. RPI on the retail side up over 13%. And with some evidence that there are expectations that there will be some relief in the site, and we think all that will play positive to continued sales that while are up year-over-year, are not at the budgeted levels we had during the year. So we hope that would be positive. But I think that's all against the backdrop, if you will, that from an underwriting perspective, the business is performing basically in line with our overall expectations when we initially acquired the property. So we remain comfortable with our outlook and our opportunity that we undertook, but we are experiencing short-term aspects of the economy right there, which just may be a positive as we refer to a kind of a green shoot if that were to come to fruition.\nJohn Kim: And what about the currency impact? The British pound kind of worked in your favor over the last couple of months?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: John, that would – the expectations would reflect the weaker dollar by $0.03 in the FX rate.\nJohn Kim: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robyn Luu with Green Street.\nRobyn Luu: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on real estate taxes. I noticed that it was 10% increase this quarter. Do you expect taxes to trend at this level for the remainder of the year? And can you also just remind us when you expect to receive new tax assessments for the next year?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hi, Robyn, our expectations for the full year for our total same-property portfolio are lower than what we experienced in the first quarter, call it, in that 7% to 8% range. The assessments come in on a rolling basis over the course of the year and depends on state-by-state basis. So they are rolling.\nRobyn Luu: Can you bring context was the 7% to 8% would be budgeted for the initial guidance?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: That would be in line with our original expectations.\nRobyn Luu: And then my second question, I understand that there has been discussions with the Ingenia management team recently and perhaps visited Australia. Can you give us an update on the Australian joint venture and what your longer-term plan is for that partnership?\nGary Shiffman: We look at the opportunity, Robyn, we remain very positive to be part of the growth in land lease community taking place in Australia. So we feel good about our optionality and ability to participate in that growth, which we think is at a very early stage. We're pleased with the current performance of our Sungenia joint venture, we have two properties that have now been developed out and selling homes. Freshwater is an age-restricted development, and we have a second one that's come online. And we have three other developments in process, which we expect to see some contribution from in the late second half of the year. With regard to Ingenia, the headstock overall, they have noted continued challenges in securing home supply and construction as related to the pandemic, and that has impacted settlements or home sales closings, which they've guided to. So we're carefully evaluating any further investment, and we'll share with you and our shareholders as the year goes on as to the success that's taking place in those developments.\nRobyn Luu: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Just one more question on the UK home sales. If I remember correctly from last year, I think part of the thesis was that you would be able to sell higher end homes by combining sites at upgrading sites in the UK, saying kind of the larger lodge units. Is that still a long-term initiative for the unit? Or is that maybe payback given the economic environment?\nGary Shiffman: No, it is long. We have several long-term strategies that we've talked about. Certainly, upgrading to the lodges brings a higher pitch fee with it because they are based on the size of the lodge amongst other things. So we continue those efforts. We did note that we've seen a shift to pre-owned homes. So probably we've underwritten and guided to a slower lodge growth, which would be new home growth. At the same time, the best indication of satisfaction in one of our Park Holidays properties comes from the fact that we're seeing this huge increase in upgrades from existing residents. So that's a very, very positive thing. And we'll be able to share with you next quarter, what we've seen in sales. But certainly, those upgrades are taking place, probably a little bit slower than we forecasted earlier in the year.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Thanks. And maybe one more, I guess, on MH base rent growth, I think, 5.4% in this quarter. How is that split between, I guess, new homeowners and renewing homeowners and how do you expect to see those new homeowners? Where do you expect to see growth for that segment to trend over the next several quarters?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hi Anthony, the 5.4% is a blend of the entire portfolio. We will build towards – over the course of the year, towards the guided range of about 6.4% by the – towards the end of the year. And the rental increase in our rental program is running just below 10%, at 9.6%. So the 5.4% would be a combination for the entire portfolio, whether that's an owner that is renewing or a new resident in our communities.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. And are you able to get against market rents on those newer residents as they move in? Or is it, I guess I'm trying to see, as home sales increase or decrease, how that impacts your MH rent growth?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: When we discuss tenure in our manufactured housing of about 15 years, that's a pretty steady, right? The rental increase that we provide guidance on – that is the expectation for the portfolio, where you would see, call it, more updated rental increases would be in our rental program.\nGary Shiffman: On development expansion, I think we just don't have a large part of market increase, and we are able to push through rental increases on an annual basis across the entire portfolio.\nAnthony Powell: Got it, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I just want to go back to your comments on Savannah being like an international Marina. Can you talk about domestically how many more of those types of Marinas are out there that you might want to add to the network?\nGary Shiffman: I think, Jamie, that they probably aren't three or four similar Marinas in the country, Lauderdale Marina Center, which was the first one we acquired, has been performing exceptionally. It is also a prime example of where we've been able to change the service model and utilize vendors, third-party vendors to perform the service and lease the space to them and collect the rents and overages on the service provided. We're in the process of completing the same thing in the Savannah Yacht Center where 85% of the revenue will come in from these third parties. And as I said, the huge benefit is what it provides in value to a Safe Harbor Marina member. And this particular Marina is world-class. There's only one other one like it that I know of in the world that can service both 450 feet or longer, the Superyachts as they are known and then off-season service, the smaller vessels. So I wouldn't say there are more than a handful of them in this country and Sun probably already owns two or three of them.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. Thank you for that. So as you think about growing the Marina business and putting incremental capital to work, I mean, is it safe to assume you're going to be looking mostly at saltwater Marinas, and does that imply more likely to be buying internationally going forward? Or do you think you'll actually do more freshwater domestic Marinas to grow the business? I mean it seems like the network becomes – it's a global network. It's not necessarily a domestic network.\nGary Shiffman: I think we're quite comfortable for the foreseeable future that there are many saltwater Marinas that would strategically enhance the Safe Harbor network and those being in North America. So we've talked about from time to time, one or two points across the Atlantic, where some of the larger boats and yachts tend to go for certain parts of the season, but one of the great benefits of Savannah, [indiscernible] and Lauderdale Marina is the fact that we are seeing the results as we saw in the results this quarter, of keeping those larger craft in the Safe Harbor Marina, providing them a service here that we can't get elsewhere. So our expectation is our growth will be predominantly in North America and all saltwater.\nJamie Feldman: Okay, all right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird.\nWes Golladay: Hi, everyone. I just have a quick question on development. I think you delivered 200 units in the first quarter. What is the plan for this year? And if you can maybe give us a peek into next year?\nGary Shiffman: I think generally, we have about 1,000 sites to deliver and expansion and new development. We're really pleased with what we've delivered so far. And also the fact that we've had all the inventory that we need to be able to place units and provide for the demand in the development and expansion. And as we go forward, we talked about being able to provide three to four new manufactured housing community developments per year, which I think is a very unique way to be able to increase our manufacturing and housing percentage of our portfolio. So we're very, very happy with how development is going now and the fact that really five, six, seven years of work is now leading to the fact that we've been able to build up an inventory of entitle them, [indiscernible] basically, that doesn't exist anywhere else in the country. So we feel very, very good about our development going forward. Our expectation is for now at this rate, we can self-fund internally – we have about $200 million of capital earmark so to speak, for development and expansion this year.\nWes Golladay: Okay. If I could just get one more. Just going to the network effect. Is that fully kicked in for RV? And then for Marina, what do you think you have the full network effect?\nGary Shiffman: This is Gary. On the Marina side, I think it's increasing every single day through the value that's being perceived again having a long-term view as an owner operator and being able to invest capital for the types of returns that we discussed earlier. It has seen by the membership, the strategic locations, the ability to stay in a Safe Harbor Marina up and down the East Coast now as we build out the rest of our geographic footprint. The perks that the members experience both through advantage of service and some of the F&B and the fuel sales that we provide to the membership, that's all taking place. But I think we have a long way to go in building the continued loyalty of our already loyal membership. I think the same thing is true in the RV transient business. Sun Outdoors is only 1.5 years old. And we are seeing a lot of positivity as we connect the dots and travelers can go from Sun Outdoors community to the Sun Outdoors community. But there's a long way to go on that brand. At the same time, I'd remind everybody that we are reaching the largest levels of converting transient customers to annual customers and expect that to continue, and it's a benefit of moving people through our transient resorts and having them get that Sun Outdoor experience and being able to market to them to convert as annuals. So I think there's a lot to be gained year-over-year, and we're seeing that in the increased conversions and the stickiness, if you will, of the annual renters once they convert.\nWes Golladay: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Gary Shiffman for closing remarks.\nGary Shiffman: I would just like to thank everyone for participating on the call. And we look forward to discussing our second quarter results on the next call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our conference call to discuss first quarter 2023 earnings and our updated guidance. We're off to a strong start to the year as our first quarter performance extended Sun's track record of delivering reliable NOI growth, driven by our best-in-class properties, which supply is persistently constrained and demand remains resilient. Our focus on providing an exceptional offering for residents, guests and members, backed by a 10 of customer service in our properties is a value proposition that creates loyalty and durable revenues for Sun. Our first quarter results were stronger than we anticipated with $1.23 core FFO per share for the quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Our same-property NOI increased 6.7%, surpassing the high end of our guidance by 230 basis points, driven by strong performance across all three segments. Same-property manufactured housing NOI increased 5% compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to several factors, including rental rate increases, occupancy growth and expense savings. Same-property RV NOI increased 4.4%, driven by 6.2% revenue growth, primarily reflecting strong conversions of transient sites to annual leases. Following the unprecedented increase in transient demand during the pandemic, we continue to benefit from heightened awareness of RV vacations and anticipate continued strong demand for annual RV leases. We are capitalizing on this demand to grow our base of long-term durable rent revenues with these conversions. Same-property Marina NOI grew 15.1% in the quarter as compared to the same time last year. Marina outperformance was due to strong rental increases, higher demand that included longer stays by transient guests in our Southeastern Marinas and operating expense savings. Demand for attainable housing and for value-oriented vacationing remained high and drove same property occupancy for MH and RV, 190 basis points higher compared to the same time last year. At quarter end, occupancy was 98.6%. Sun's MH and RV annual revenue producing sites increased by 802 sites in the quarter, representing the highest first quarter volume ever recorded and a 20% increase from the same period last year. Transient RV conversions to annual leases accounted for 65% of the RPS gains, demonstrating the success of our ongoing strategic focus to grow our base of long-term residents. Development activity continues to contribute incremental value to our long-term growth. We delivered over 200 ground-up development sites and over 130 expansion sites. We also opportunistically added to our inventory of land for future development, which now represents a pipeline of approximately 16,000 sites. Currently have sufficient new home inventory available to meet the demand for the newly delivered sites. On the acquisition front, Sun continues to remain highly selective, and purchased two new assets during the quarter. We manufactured housing community in Michigan and the Savannah Yacht Center, a premier service-oriented Marina in Savannah, Georgia, with the services provided by third parties. Marina enhances our network, providing access to another strategic location for our members. We will be publishing our fifth ESG report in the coming weeks and are very proud of our team members for reaching many milestones in 2022. In the report, we highlight ESG achievements such as the Coastal Habitat Restoration Program we are piloting at Marinas in Rhode Island; our UK operations, maintaining their silver rating from investor and people and achieving ISO certification for cybersecurity. Our ESG framework score improvements and the expansion of our data coverage to include Marinas and the UK, demonstrate our company's commitment to being accountable to our investors, team members, business partners and the communities in which we operate. We are pleased with the strong start to a year and remain positive on our outlook. I would like to thank our team members for their enduring dedication and hard work. And with that, I will turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our results in more detail. So, Josh, it's Gary. As I did suggest that shifts to a quality pre-owned home. The price is lower and therefore the retail price is lower. The margin is similar to as it has been, but the contribution from a quality used home that's just smaller than a new home. And we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the new home and we're well aware of the backdrop of the economy in the UK and that effect as we think through guidance for the balance of the year. Which is the shift over long term that we're looking to make, but the results of what's happening right now relate more to the economic environment there. Hey, Derek. I think back to the matter is the decline has been very, very recent. The time from putting a deposit to closing and a buyer making a decision has slowed down. Obviously, the economic headwinds in the UK are fact that CPI is still double digit and it has an impact on the home sales decision making. But at the same time overall the portfolio performance is quite strong as we indicated. The retention is high. Site fees have been collected for the year. The holiday bookings are very strong, and the ancillary business that comes with those holiday bookings has been strong. Easter was an exceptional holiday week that we've just experienced on vacation homes. But we are very cognizant and aware of the economy there and have adjusted the home sales as we look out to match what we've seen in this more recent period of time, which really did correlate with the March period of time. That being said, we can share that April we've been following closely and there's been positive undertones, but taking an approach to how we want to think about going forward, we made the adjustment to the home sales moving forward. Well, certainly, we are very, very focused on that underwriting and this is a time where basically we can focus more on integrating what we already have in the portfolio and extract, as we like to say, the low hanging fruit, develop out the sites and grow the existing portfolio. So as far as our appetite and our underwriting moving forward, it will be very, very disciplined. And as we always say, the pencil is very sharp at this time. So I wouldn't look for any major acquisition opportunity. And I would just reiterate our initial underwriting perspective in the business was long term. And it remains long term. We think we have the right portfolio best in class, as a matter of fact. A demonstrated management team that has been through tough economic environments before and done well. And I think that we're watching them adjust to this difficult market that exists right out there. So as it relates to moving forward on underwriting it is adjusted to reflect the current, what we believe is short-term impact of the market. Yes. I think that we're very pleased with marina performance to date, not only the outstanding performance this quarter, but what we've seen quarter after quarter over the last two years. Our view is that having the benefit of the entire network gives us an advantage over all competitors. And it's really showing in the demand for wet slips and dry slips is for virtually at full occupancy with waiting lists at many of the marinas. And we've had the strong benefit of strategically acquiring what we refer to as the international marinas that allow us to keep the boats that are very, very large in the Safe Harbor system. And especially on the transient side when these boats come in for repair work that they often would head across the Mediterranean for. We're keeping them longer in our network as we're able to provide the service for them. So the other thing I'd point to, we have opportunity in about 30 plus marinas to reconfigure smaller slips into larger slips. There are two being redeveloped this year. There are Lebanon for permitting process. So we can do that. And the advantage of this also is the ability to be able to charge higher linear footage rates for the longer boats and the greatest growth in the marina vessel businesses and boats 30 feet or greater, that certainly require the wet slips. So we have a nice opportunity there to continue to grow. And I think a lot of it comes from the fact that as we have acquired the marina platform, we've been able to invest for the long term making small capital improvements that are well received by the members, and therefore allowing probably a much larger share of demand to take place currently in the Safe Harbor network. So we look to build on the strength that we saw this quarter. So when we invest for that type of CapEx, we look for a 9% to 12% return. Yes, it's a great question. Certainly, cost of capital and the impact of – it has a big impact on transactions. When we think of MH, certainly, Sun has been one of the biggest consolidators. There is very little if any cap rate expansion that we've seen. In fact, we saw another couple properties trade with a three or sub three handle over the last two quarters. And we were looking and evaluating those – but they sold far inside of anything that we would've paid for them. So I think that moving forward, adjusting for the fact that there are much fewer acquisitions out there on the MH side. There'll be kind of a [indiscernible] opportunity. On the marina side, we're very, very focused on the growth that we've had, and we have the ability to be very, very selective okay. And strategically inclined to look at acquisitions moving forward. So I think it'll be a quieter period of time on the acquisition side moving forward. Hey John, we too are aware of how the valuers are thinking about things, but that is on the general homeowner market. And what we would suggest is that is very positive because those are the owners who are buying second vacation homes in the Park Holidays portfolio. So it is something that we'll just have to watch and it could be something that creates a positive impact as we move forward. We can only underwrite – so what we're seeing right now, we know that the CPI environment is 10-plus percent there. RPI on the retail side up over 13%. And with some evidence that there are expectations that there will be some relief in the site, and we think all that will play positive to continued sales that while are up year-over-year, are not at the budgeted levels we had during the year. So we hope that would be positive. But I think that's all against the backdrop, if you will, that from an underwriting perspective, the business is performing basically in line with our overall expectations when we initially acquired the property. So we remain comfortable with our outlook and our opportunity that we undertook, but we are experiencing short-term aspects of the economy right there, which just may be a positive as we refer to a kind of a green shoot if that were to come to fruition. We look at the opportunity, Robyn, we remain very positive to be part of the growth in land lease community taking place in Australia. So we feel good about our optionality and ability to participate in that growth, which we think is at a very early stage. We're pleased with the current performance of our Sungenia joint venture, we have two properties that have now been developed out and selling homes. Freshwater is an age-restricted development, and we have a second one that's come online. And we have three other developments in process, which we expect to see some contribution from in the late second half of the year. With regard to Ingenia, the headstock overall, they have noted continued challenges in securing home supply and construction as related to the pandemic, and that has impacted settlements or home sales closings, which they've guided to. So we're carefully evaluating any further investment, and we'll share with you and our shareholders as the year goes on as to the success that's taking place in those developments. No, it is long. We have several long-term strategies that we've talked about. Certainly, upgrading to the lodges brings a higher pitch fee with it because they are based on the size of the lodge amongst other things. So we continue those efforts. We did note that we've seen a shift to pre-owned homes. So probably we've underwritten and guided to a slower lodge growth, which would be new home growth. At the same time, the best indication of satisfaction in one of our Park Holidays properties comes from the fact that we're seeing this huge increase in upgrades from existing residents. So that's a very, very positive thing. And we'll be able to share with you next quarter, what we've seen in sales. But certainly, those upgrades are taking place, probably a little bit slower than we forecasted earlier in the year. On development expansion, I think we just don't have a large part of market increase, and we are able to push through rental increases on an annual basis across the entire portfolio. I think, Jamie, that they probably aren't three or four similar Marinas in the country, Lauderdale Marina Center, which was the first one we acquired, has been performing exceptionally. It is also a prime example of where we've been able to change the service model and utilize vendors, third-party vendors to perform the service and lease the space to them and collect the rents and overages on the service provided.

            "name": "Fernando Castro-Caratini",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. First, I wanted to call your attention to the supplemental disclosure changes you likely noticed in the document published after the market closed yesterday. We have made a number of updates that are aligned with how we manage Sun as a whole and are intended to help you analyze our business better and more quickly. Our goal is that you find these modifications helpful and we welcome feedback. Core FFO per share was $1.23 for the first quarter, exceeding the high end of guidance by $0.03. The outperformance was driven by higher than anticipated real property revenue in manufactured housing, which benefited from rental rate growth and higher demand for our rental program sites from RV annual revenues that benefited from conversions of transient sites and from stronger than expected demand at our marinas. Additionally, the quarter's results benefited from higher utility rebuilds and effective expense management at the properties. At the same property level, outperformance throughout our portfolio contributed to the 6.7% increase in total same property NOI. Same property manufactured housing NOI grew 5% over the prior year, resulting from a 6.4% increase in revenues and 10.4% expense growth. The outperformance in revenues was due to a 280 site increase in MH revenue producing sites, which was more than four times the occupancy gains realized in the first quarter of 2022. In RV, same property NOI increased 4.4% for the first quarter with a 6.2% increase in revenues and an 8.1% expense increase. During the first quarter, we converted 524 transient sites to annual leases, which was ahead of our expectations. As we continue to execute on our strategy of converting sites and capturing more annual revenue, we expect to also see a related reduction in transient revenue. Marina same property NOI increased 15.1% in the first quarter consisting of a 10.9% increase in revenues and a 4.3% increase in expenses. Marina same property revenue benefited from stronger than expected transient demand, especially in the southeast and continued expense management. During the quarter, we sold 589 homes in North America, which exceeded volume and margin expectations. In the UK, real property NOI was ahead of expectations in a quarter due to higher owner retention. NOI from home sales was below expectations in a quarter due to lower volume and the increased mix of pre-owned versus new home sales. Turning to investment activity, we purchased the Savannah Yacht Center for $100 million and funded the entire purchase price by issuing convertible preferred OP units. For the manufactured housing community acquired for $7 million, we issued a combination of OP units and cash. As of March 31, 2023, the company had $7.5 billion in debt outstanding. The weighted average interest rate was 3.9%, and the weighted average years to maturity was 7.4 years. Our leverage ratio on a run rate basis is six times. Based on our operating cash flow expectations for the year, we anticipate the leveraging towards our 5.5 times long-term leverage target over the remainder of the year. In terms of new financing activity, since our last call, we completed two additional mortgage loans that raised $100 million of fixed rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of 5.7%. In total, during the quarter, we raised approximately $585 million of fixed rate debt and used proceeds to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility. Additionally, we swapped another 100 million pounds on our sterling denominated term loan to lock in a fixed all-in rate of 4.8%. At the end of the quarter, our floating rate debt was at 16%, which is in line with our internal expectations. Excluding our senior credit facility borrowings between now and the end of 2025, less than 8% of our total debt matures. We continue to look at opportunities in the financing markets to further enhance our balance sheet, including terming out debt and reducing secured debt amounts. As detailed in our supplemental, we are affirming our guidance range for core FFO per share for the year of $7.22 to $7.42, and establishing core FFO per share guidance for the second quarter of $1.90 to $1.98. We expect higher total portfolio, real property NOI growth of 6.1% to 7%, driven by additional NOI from first quarter acquisitions and from higher same property NOI growth. We also expect higher contributions from North America home sales total SRD&E and lower G&A expense to offset a lower contribution from home sales in the UK. We now expect total same property NOI to grow by 5% to 6% for the year, representing a 10 basis points increase to prior guidance. The increase is driven by stronger than previously expected growth in same property manufactured housing and marina partially offset by slower transient revenue growth expectations in same property RV. Our revised same property NOI growth ranges for the year are 4.6% to 5.4% for manufactured housing, 4.4% to 5.6% for RV and 6.8% to 8% for marina. For our UK operations, we are lowering our full year range for total real property and home sales NOI by roughly 10%. Do a new NOI range of $141 million to $148 million. For additional details regarding our updated full year guidance and second quarter expectations, please see our supplemental disclosures. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through April 26, and the effect of a property disposition under contract expected to close during the second quarter. But it does not include the impact of perspective acquisitions, dispositions, or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator? Sure. Thank you, Josh. And good morning all. The drivers to the changes are actually an increase to expectations in real property NOI from the UK that's increasing by about 9% at the midpoint or about $5.5 million. And a decrease in expected contribution from home sales of about 20% or about $21 million that would be for the full year. So that would have the impact of performance over the first quarter and then our revised expectations for the rest of the year. Certainly, we're seeing shifts in the strategy as far as stronger, as Gary mentioned in his remarks, stronger owner retention at the property level that is driving the increased expectations on the real property side. We did see softer demand in the first quarter from a volume perspective and as Gary mentioned in the mix of homes which carry different margin expectations. Josh, in our updated guidance, the percentage split between real property and home sales is about 45% coming from real property and 55% coming from home sales. Hi, Keegan, it's Fernando. So the revised expectations on the same property RV side of 75 basis points at the midpoint equate to about $2.1 million of NOI from initial guidance provided in February. That will – that is primarily coming from the transient revenue line item where we have revised our expectations. In February, we gave guidance of about 50 basis points of growth at the midpoint for the year, given the strong number of conversions that we've made already and expectations for the rest of the year. And we did see some weather impact in the first quarter in California and in the southwest. That's – those are the primary drivers. So the revenue – the reforecasted revenue expectations are offset partially by expected expense savings in that part of the portfolio. Versus last year, we're from a pay standpoint, we're running about 5% or 6% below last year. That is not contemplated in our guidance range. Keegan, the fact of the matter is that fair and market rates have not really improved. We're continuing our deep dive analysis of reviewing and analyzing our insurance needs in order to optimize cost versus risk. And as you might be referring to these options we view include adjusting our retention pieces and levels throughout the stack for various types of risk. More closely examining usage of our captive, which is virtually unused at this time, looking for our opportunities to work with new reinsurance groups. Although that's been met with some headwinds because as we're – I think all aware of right now. The overall insurance market is very, very challenged. So it's just a continuing effort to improve the cost and examine that we have the right risk adjusted cost going forward. So we would share with the market any cost savings that we believe we have found going forward. Sure. Thank you, Michael. The expense savings would primarily come from offsetting some of the revenue expectations on the transient RV side. That's going to be the largest driver. But also we are – we did experience in the first quarter and are expecting for the rest of the year higher utility rebuilds which is decreasing our year-over-year expense on that side of the expense stack given increased focus on rebuilds to tenants, as well as, right, we've talked about this before, but our solar array projects of which we have 35 today and another 15 underway which ultimately will continue to save on electric expense as we deploy these projects. On the second part of your question on the G&A side, those expectations that bringing those cost expectations down is primarily coming from salaries and wages. Correct. At the property level. Sure. Our original expectations for home sales contribution in North America were about $17 million. So we are seeing increased expectations there. In the first quarter, we did see from internal expectations we saw more pre-owned homes sold than then budgeted at higher margins, which drove out performance in that part of the business as we – for the rest of the year, as we focus on right from a back to basics filling sites that we have just created in across expansion sites and our ground up development projects will – this is one of the levers we can pull to fill those sites. But we're – home sales are performing strong over the course of the first three, four months of the year. Yes, Samir I would add just extremely selective as far as the acquisitions that we did in the first quarter, the $7 million manufactured housing community, that was a near completed round of development that we bought in our backyard in Michigan that we will fill up quickly. Given that's a tried and true model. The Savannah Yacht Center on the marina side, really this is a two plus two equals five as far as the – how it complements the network and being able to keep more of the business within the network itself, would also point to the funding mechanism for the Savannah Yacht Center, which was a convertible preferred operating partnership, the entire purchase price where we are, we did issue these securities and they would convert at a 30% – almost 30% premium to where we were trading at the time when we closed the acquisition. So certainly being very opportunistic and using the funding sources that are available to us in the market. John, so these were – essentially, I'll use a nontechnical term, borrow-ups on an existing facility with GSEs where we essentially increased the LTV that had been – that had come down over the course of the last couple of years from a financing that we've done in 2019. This was done on manufactured housing assets. This was eight years of weighted average maturity for that financing. And it would be in line with, say, our unsecured borrowing rates today based on where the 10-year is and expected spread. But Gary earlier made a comment on expectations from a pricing perspective or manufactured housing. That haven't really shifted over the course of the last 12, 18 months, given the scarcity value of manufactured housing. We've seen little to no widening of pricing expectations for the highest quality manufactured housing assets that we own in our portfolio or that we would be interested in buying. John, that would – the expectations would reflect the weaker dollar by $0.03 in the FX rate. Hi, Robyn, our expectations for the full year for our total same-property portfolio are lower than what we experienced in the first quarter, call it, in that 7% to 8% range. The assessments come in on a rolling basis over the course of the year and depends on state-by-state basis. So they are rolling. That would be in line with our original expectations. Hi Anthony, the 5.4% is a blend of the entire portfolio. We will build towards – over the course of the year, towards the guided range of about 6.4% by the – towards the end of the year. And the rental increase in our rental program is running just below 10%, at 9.6%. So the 5.4% would be a combination for the entire portfolio, whether that's an owner that is renewing or a new resident in our communities. When we discuss tenure in our manufactured housing of about 15 years, that's a pretty steady, right? The rental increase that we provide guidance on – that is the expectation for the portfolio, where you would see, call it, more updated rental increases would be in our rental program."

At this time, management would like me to inform you that certain statements made during this call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can provide no assurance that its expectations will be achieved. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in today's press release and from time to time in the company's periodic filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to advise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release. Having said that, I would like to introduce management with us today, Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Fernando Castro-Caratini, Chief Financial Officer; Aaron Weiss, Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development; and John McLaren, President. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin.\nGary Shiffman : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results, the strategic updates we are announcing and our guidance for 2024. First, I want to emphasize my disappointment in the results we are reporting and our revised outlook for the remainder of the year. As I will discuss, we are acting swiftly to address our underperformance. As communicated, we have been focused on executing our strategic initiatives to position Sun Communities to deliver sustained earnings growth over the long term. The business fundamentals of our portfolio remain strong. And we are confident that by continuing to execute on our strategic priorities, the company will be positioned for growth, thereby demonstrating the long-term value of our assets. These priorities as articulated and executed in 2024 include recycling non-strategic assets, reducing debt and increasing the contribution from annual income streams. We continue to make progress in each of these areas. In the third quarter, we disposed of eight manufactured housing communities for approximately $300 million, along with two manufactured housing land parcels for $37 million, bringing total proceeds from asset sales to $392 million year-to-date. As of September 30, our total debt stood at $7.36 billion, a reduction of approximately $450 million from the end of 2023, and our floating to fixed rate mix currently stands at approximately 6%, down from 21% two years ago. That said, we acknowledge that our third quarter results and our adjusted 2024 guidance are below both our and the market's expectations. And we are very disappointed by our performance. Starting with our board of directors, the entire Sun organization is committed to proactively addressing our challenges and restructuring Sun to unlock the value and earnings potential of our portfolio as we demonstrated for the past two decades. Before I address the acceleration of our strategic plans, I wanted to provide an update on the recent short report issued on Sun. Upon being made aware of the report, the board tasked the Audit Committee to address the matters that have raised. The Audit Committee engaged an independent third-party law firm to investigate the report. After a thorough review, the law firm has concluded its investigation, and there have been no changes to our financial reporting practices and the Audit Committee determined that the company complied with its disclosure obligations. The company reiterates its strong commitment to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and internal controls as well as timely and transparent disclosure in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Evident in our results is the impact of continuing volatility in the transient components of our business, which we have been proactively working to reduce as well as cost pressures. We are not satisfied with our performance and are acting with great urgency. To that end, we undertook a comprehensive bottom-up review throughout the organization and concurrent with today's earnings release, we are announcing a broad repositioning effort to more effectively align the company's operating expense and G&A infrastructure to deliver earnings growth. We have been considering and studying many of these cost-saving initiatives throughout this year, and we are now ready to accelerate their implementation and expansion. I am pleased to announce that John McLaren is returning to the company on a full-time basis as President to oversee this accelerated repositioning and the execution of these initiatives. John has been with Sun for 22 years, was Chief Operating Officer for 14 years and was President for 8 years through 2022. During his time as Chief Operating Officer, John oversaw the integration and operation of almost 350 manufactured housing and RV communities and brought a performance-driven approach with a focus on bottom line operational results. The cost reduction measures include better operating expense management and the implementation of identified efficiencies and savings to the company's cost base. It is expected that these will be achieved primarily through initiatives, including reorganizing our operational structure, streamlining and optimizing our technology systems, implementing more effective asset management to drive efficiencies, maximize revenue and other cost-cutting measures. As of today, we have identified and expect to realize annualized G&A and operating expense savings of between $15 million and $20 million or approximately $0.11 to $0.15 per share as we rebase our cost structure for 2025. I want to emphasize that this is just a starting point, and we will continue to seek additional efficiencies and revenue enhancement opportunities. We anticipate strong rental rate increases in 2025, and this restructuring should allow our top line growth to translate into attractive earnings growth by establishing a sustainable and efficient cost structure. Additionally, as announced this evening, I've informed the board of my intention to retire in 2025, following more than 40 years with the company. I led the company through its $115 million IPO in 1993 as a small manufactured housing REIT with 31 manufactured housing communities. And Sun has evolved into the leading owner and operator of MH and RV and marinas with a market capitalization of approximately $16 billion. I am proud of what we have accomplished and believe it is time to transition the CEO role. The board of directors has a CEO search committee in place led by independent board members, Jeff Blau, CEO of the related companies; and Tonya Allen, President of the McKnight Foundation, to conduct a comprehensive search process to identify and hire a new CEO. Turning to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We are happy to share that none of our team members, residents or guests were injured during these events. We extend our deepest gratitude to our team members for their exceptional care and compassion in supporting our residents and guests, all while managing their own personal challenges in the lead-up and aftermath of the storms. Cleanup crews were deployed immediately and our teams worked swiftly to provide necessary supplies, food and resources. The company continues to assess the overall impact of the storms. Most of the damage was limited to trees, fencing, skirting and carports, while our common buildings and utility infrastructure remained largely unaffected. We have one small RV property that is partially closed, and we anticipate it will fully reopen in early 2025. Similarly, our marina portfolio sustained only minimal damage with some bulkheads and docks requiring relocation or replacement. Overall, our assets weathered the storms well, and we are optimistic in our ability to manage the recovery process efficiently. Our supplemental report provides additional details. While we fell short of guidance this quarter, we still achieved year-over-year growth across our key manufactured housing, annual RV and marina segments. As we look to next year, we believe the strategic initiatives already in place, along with the steps we now are taking will enable reliable growth moving forward. In our manufactured housing segment, nearly 35% of our residents received rent increase notices for 2025 at the end of October with an average increase of 5.2%. For our RV portfolio, annual rates have been established for approximately 55% of sites, reflecting an average growth rate of 5.1%. In the UK, all residents have been informed of a 3.7% rent increase for 2025, and 51% of our marina members have also received notice of a 3.7% rental increase. Importantly, we are positioned in sectors with compelling supply-demand dynamics. The ongoing demand for attainable housing and affordable vacationing continues to be a key driver of our platform's success, fueling organic real property NOI growth. We are not satisfied with the results, and we are leveraging every available tool so our platform reflects the underlying value of our assets, and that it delivers sustainable and reliable earnings growth over time. I will now turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our financial results and guidance. Fernando?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Gary. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Sun reported core FFO per share of $2.34. Total North America same-property NOI increased by 0.5%, driven by a 2.8% increase in revenues, offset by a 7.7% increase in expenses. This underperformance relative to our expectations was driven primarily by higher expenses, continued headwinds in transient RV, compounded by the September hurricane further impacting Florida and Southeast transient business and home sales. Here's a closer look by segment. Our core North America manufactured housing business continued to deliver growth, with same-property NOI increasing by 5.3% year-over-year. Although our revenue growth was strong, we faced elevated expenses, primarily due to higher supply and repair costs. Despite these pressures, our year-to-date growth remains strong at 6.6%, reaffirming the long-term fundamentals of the segment. The RV segment faced top line and expense challenges this quarter, leading to a 6.9% decline in same-property NOI, largely attributed to a 10.4% reduction in transient revenue. While we were tracking generally in line with guidance for the first two months of the quarter, transient revenue and resultant NOI underperformed in September. Despite this, our annual RV business remains strong with nearly 900 sites converted from transient to annual this quarter, accounting for 85% of total revenue-producing site gains year-to-date. So far this year, we have completed almost 2,000 transient-to-annual conversions, further increasing our recurring income stream, supported by long-term occupancy and revenue stability. Supply and repair and utility costs were elevated in the quarter, driving underperformance beyond the transient revenue headwinds. In our marina segment, same-property NOI increased by 2.5% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. The segment faced pressures from the delay of large vessel returns from the Mediterranean due to storms, including Helene and lower overall occupancy. Also, similar to our MH and RV segments, we experienced higher-than-expected operating expense pressures, further impacting marina NOI performance in the quarter. We have invested strategically in our marinas, including the acquisition in the third quarter of one marina and one bolt-on for approximately $52 million, primarily funded through the issuance of common OP units. These additions expand our member networks and enhance our capabilities and customer experience. In the UK, overall occupancy increased by 110 basis points from the prior year, while timing factors related to residents leaving and new owners moving in led to a same-property NOI decline of approximately $700,000 or 2.3% this quarter. A key year-over-year expense driver was higher payroll costs stemming from a UK national minimum wage increase of approximately 13% this year. Despite this, the segment shows positive momentum with increased rental rates and vacation revenue driving year-to-date same-property NOI growth of 7.7%. There remains some broader uncertainty around UK fiscal policy and the macroeconomic outlook, but we are encouraged by our positive momentum driven by higher rental rates. Additionally, home sales revenue rose 5.2% compared to last year with stable margins. SRD&E NOI came in below expectations, primarily linked to softer transient demand in the RV and marina segments. Core FFO contribution from North American home sales was lower than expected in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Helene in Florida, prior to which we were ahead of internal expectations for July and August. During the quarter, in relation to Hurricane Helene, we recognized $2.2 million of impairment charges for assets at 5 MH and RV communities and $1.7 million for assets at 9 marinas with impacted properties located in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. On October 9, Hurricane Milton impacted some of the company's properties in Florida. The company responded promptly and cleanup and restoration efforts are underway. We believe we have adequate insurance coverage, including property, casualty, flood and business interruption and at this time, do not anticipate a significant adverse impact on operating results or financial condition. Impairment estimates are based on current information and may adjust as assessments continue. As it relates to our balance sheet, we continue to advance our capital recycling strategy, selling eight manufactured housing communities for approximately $300 million and two MH land parcels for $37 million. We also reduced non-recurring capital expenditures, down approximately $255 million through September versus 2023, reflecting a nearly 50% year-over-year decrease. Additionally, we settled all forward sales agreements with respect to 2.7 million shares of common stock under our at-the-market program. This activity took place during August and the first days of September and resulted in net proceeds of approximately $362 million. Combined proceeds from asset sales and the ATM program were used to pay down secured debt and our revolving line of credit, strengthening our balance sheet for sustainable growth going forward. As compared to 2023 year-end, we have approximately $450 million of less debt on our balance sheet today. As of September 30, SUN's debt balance stood at $7.36 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and a weighted average maturity of 6.4 years. Our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio is 6 times. We are continuing to evaluate non-core asset and land parcel capital recycling opportunities to continue to focus on our core portfolio and our deleveraging path. Turning to updated 2024 guidance. We are adjusting our full year core FFO per share guidance to a range of $6.76 to $6.84, a reduction of 4.8% at the midpoint from our prior expectations. This reflects the impact of third quarter underperformance and the continuation of headwinds in the business, inclusive of transient RV revenue and higher expenses for the fourth quarter. We are reducing North American same-property NOI guidance by 225 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 2.6% to 3.3%. Summarizing the changes by segment. Manufactured housing same-property NOI expectations are reduced to a range of 5.6% to 6.2%, primarily driven by higher expenses across supply and repair and utilities. RV same-property NOI expectations are reduced to a range of negative 5.3% to negative 4.1%. The change is primarily driven by continued headwinds in transient RV revenues and higher expense expectations, primarily in supply and repair and utilities. Full year transient RV revenue is now expected to decline by 11.9% at the midpoint versus July expectations of a 10.3% decline due in part to an impact from Helene and Milton on our Florida assets and the broader Southeast RV portfolio. Marina same-property NOI expectations are reduced to a range of 4.4% to 5.2%. The change is primarily driven by occupancy declines, including the delayed returns of large vessels to the U.S. from the summer and fall boating season in Europe, in part due to weather patterns. Expenses are running higher than originally expected, mainly in payroll. For our UK same-property portfolio, we are reducing NOI growth expectations to a range of 7.1% to 8.7%, primarily due to the move in timing of new owners and higher expenses in supply and repair and payroll. Service, retail, dining and entertainment NOI, primarily linked to transient demand in RV and marina, is expected to experience continued headwinds into the fourth quarter. FFO contribution from North American home sales expectations are also lower, reflecting fewer sales expected in Florida and the Southeast due to hurricane activity. These headwinds are anticipated to be partially offset by higher-than-expected UK income tax refunds. As reflected in our updated guidance, we are anticipating some specific headwinds for the remainder of this year. However, we continue to see stability in our core business and are constructive on our outlook beyond 2024 as we realize the impact of our accelerated and expanded initiatives. Importantly, this is supported by the strong rental rate increases that we expect to see next year of 5.2% in manufactured housing, 5.1% in annual RV and 3.7% in the UK and marina segments. We also anticipate annualized operating and G&A expense savings of between $15 million to $20 million or approximately $0.11 to $0.15 per share on a run rate basis, as well as interest expense savings from lower current and expected year-end debt balances versus 2024. Finally, as we have discussed, we continue to focus on our reliable real property income and reducing transient exposure while materially reducing our non-recurring capital expenditures and selectively recycling assets for further debt paydown. For additional details regarding our updated full year guidance, please see our supplemental disclosures. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through November 6, but it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSamir Khanal : Hey, good morning, everybody. On the cost savings that you identified, the $15 million to $20 million, how much of that is OpEx and G&A? And I know you talked about potentially identifying more. Maybe expand on that comment as we think about maybe in '25 and into '26. Thanks.\nGary Shiffman : Hi, Samir, it's Gary. I think that as we shared in the remarks that, that is a starting point for us. With John McLaren coming on board, he's working closely with the group to evaluate what opportunities there are with regard to additional cost savings. Most of that focuses on the MH, RV side as we continue to look into the other business platforms on the Park Holidays side and working with Safe Harbor to identify additional opportunities and cost savings going forward. So it is a combined amount of both OpEx and G&A savings.\nSamir Khanal : And then can I ask -- if I can ask for one more here in terms of question. Can you talk about any further dispositions in the pipeline currently? I think the pool that you said about -- year-to-date, you've done about $390 million. I guess how big is that pool for noncore assets at this point? Thanks.\nFernando Castro-Caratini : Hi, Samir, this is Fernando. We are continuing to evaluate single asset, small portfolio and non-income producing land potential dispositions for capital recycling. As outlined in the investor presentation that we put out this evening, there's potential for an additional $100 million to $200 million over the near term.\nSamir Khanal : Okay, thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay : Hey, everyone. Can you maybe comment on the guidance? I mean you had some segments you were just taking up last quarter. Now they're coming down. It seems like it's a lot of expense related. But I mean how hard are those line items to forecast? I'm just having a hard time understanding why we're bouncing around so much on a business that is pretty resilient, sticky business.\nGary Shiffman : Yeah. I think reflecting on this quarter, Wes, in the fourth quarter, we are, as we discussed, extremely disappointed with the results. The primary challenges we had in the quarter were related to the businesses we've identified as more volatile than our core MH business and annual RV business, notably transient RV and marinas, which underperformed. Especially as Fernando said in September going into July and August, we felt much more comfortable with where our results were, but September really did not perform well. So alongside this was some occupancy headwinds, if you will, in the marinas due to the adverse weather effects and the adverse weather effects on home sales in Florida. We moved from ahead of internal guidance early in the quarter to well behind in September. The most disappointing for us was the lack of ability to achieve expense objectives in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, having identified the full scope of those. A lot of those fall under third-party providers where we need to flex better against the reduced revenue in these transient areas and did not accomplish our goals of flexing expenses during the time that we needed to and thought that we would flex them and during this rapid decline in September on the revenue side of the transient business. So there is what we've been focused on and continue to be focused on going forward. And under John's leadership and having the experience, the track record, if you will, the ability to focus on the bottom line, that's where we're concentrating all our efforts with regard to reorganizing and being in position for growth in '25.\nJohn McLaren: Yeah, Wes, this is John. Let me just -- I think you know I've managed this portfolio in the past for over 14 years. And what I can confidently tell you is this: we continue to have the best team in the business. Our communities look excellent. I know that because even over the last two years, I still go around creep around the communities and everybody. They may not know it, but I do. The fundamentals of our portfolio are strong. The opportunity is there. We're not reinventing high-quality properties. We already have them. We're not reinventing strong demand. We already have it. But instead, it's about taking a closer look at how we'll execute on efficiency and performance opportunities in certain areas. We are making targeted adjustments to enhance what's already working as well as the operations teams that frankly have carried out the methodologies I originally put in place. But we're also constantly reevaluating where change is needed to ensure long-term success. This is just what we've done. This is what we do. And so being plugged back into that is going to be exciting.\nWes Golladay : And welcome back, John. I look forward to working with you again. A quick question on the CEO search. Would there be a potential internal candidate?\nGary Shiffman : I think that what I would suggest is the board has always focused on succession planning at all levels. Certainly, they have two great co-chairs in Jeff Blau and Tonya Allen to oversee the committee that's been appointed. They will use a search firm, and they will run a very, very strong process. And I think it would be expected they will look both internally and externally.\nWes Golladay : Okay, that’s all for me. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph : Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Eric. Obviously, a lot announced tonight. But as the board thinks about maximizing shareholder value, is everything on the table in terms of selling the company or selling large portfolios? Or are you more committed to trying to maximize value within?\nGary Shiffman : Hi, Eric, it's Gary. I think in general, our goal as a public company is always to maximize value. So we look at all opportunities, and it's not specific to any one part of the business. So as those opportunities come up, as responsible operators of a public company, we look at everything.\nNick Joseph : Thanks. And then just in terms of the G&A, the non-recurring G&A went up significantly. Just wondering if you can walk through what's driving that as well as the recurring G&A increase that we saw.\nFernando Castro-Caratini : Sure, Nick. The largest driver in the non-recurring piece of G&A is an insurance receivable that was written off in the quarter from a legal settlement in -- prior to this period. The other components of the non-recurring, we had an additional $2.5 million of deal costs and severance expenses in the quarter. On the recurring side, the main driver of the increase is payroll related.\nNick Joseph : Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Congratulations, Gary. Welcome back, John. Just to follow up on the question on the non-recurring G&A. Is the new outlook for the G&A ex non-recurring expenses? Is that the right way to think about kind of like the starting point for how we should be thinking about it for next year? And then the restructuring expenses come out of that. Or because the guidance kind of moved up with the new outlook, is the restructuring expenses expected to kind of get back to where you were? Thanks.\nFernando Castro-Caratini : So Michael, the run rate expense savings that we've detailed will be on a 2025 basis. And that -- so it would be from the recurring piece of G&A.\nMichael Goldsmith : Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kim : Thank you. Gary, can I ask your decision to retire from the CEO position, what drove that decision? How much of that was influenced from the Blue Orca report that came out? And if you have any commentary on some of those findings, including the personal loans taken from some board members.\nGary Shiffman : Yeah. I think -- thanks for asking, John, because certainly, it is a big decision in my life. After 40 years of building this business with the last 30 as a public company, I've been contemplating my next steps, especially over the last couple of years. At this stage of my life with three children and lots of grandchildren, there are a lot of other things I want to experience. And while I love this business and deeply value its continued success, I'm just confident in the strategic objectives we put in place, and I really am excited with the progress we're making. So having John here to help drive our initiatives was also a key factor in my decision to move forward with a transition. And it is not related to any report or anything like that. It's just the period of time and the fact that starting this process for a company that I co-founded back in 1975, it is certainly bittersweet for me, but I couldn't be more excited about what lies ahead for Sun. It will continue to be the largest single contributor of my net worth. So I remain very, very excited and very positive, if you will, about the growth opportunity for Sun. So I look forward to working with the board and the company on a transition and as the committee runs its search process. But it is a bittersweet moment for me, and I've watched this company, as we talked about earlier, grow, if you will, from a handful of communities 30-plus years ago to what it is today. So I'm pleased at what we've accomplished, and I just do think it's time for a new CEO to step in and take over.\nJohn Kim : And given the company is such a complex business today, what do you think the priorities will be as far as finding a new CEO? Will it be someone with turnaround experience, someone with public REIT experience? Anything you could share as far as what do you think the priorities are?\nGary Shiffman : Well, that's a great question, and I just want to take the opportunity to talk about the complexity of the company. Unfortunately, the quarter was bad, and we're responsible for it. I've been running the company, as I said, back to 1975 even as a private company. So it's never an ideal time to report these kinds of results. That said, after all these years, I am just very positive, as I said, about the outlook of the portfolio of properties and the business. And I want to take a moment just to say part of the reason for my transition is what we're accomplishing and what we've accomplished. Aside from the results and the repositioning that we're sharing with the market to get back to sustainable profitability, we have been accomplishing simplifying the business, if you will, removing as much complexity as we can step by step. The things that we've talked about, removing our ownership of the that stock in Australia, some of the JVs that we've removed out of, continuing to push towards more budgetable and dependable annual revenue away from the transient revenue, improving the balance sheet. And Fernando talked about what great progress we're making there. Set up the company -- and this is where I feel comfortable, really to be in good hands for a new CEO to step in, especially with John here overseeing a lot of the reorganization while we're looking for that new CEO. So I think the skill set will really be important, but it really will tie into the quality of the assets and the ability, as we've always said, of a portfolio that has great occupancy, has continued ability to increase rental rents every single year and control expenses, which we now know we need to do a better job. So I think there's a wide range. And I think we continue to examine opportunities within the portfolio to remove complexity. And I think that will be a piece of what the new CEO does.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJamie Feldman : Thank you. I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on the Audit Committee review from the independent third-party law firm. I guess just maybe if you can give any more detail on their perspective on any of the items in the short report. And then also, I mean, were there any suggestions or changes made, whether the Board or management, as a result of their review? Or it was pretty much just kind of checking things off, saying all good.\nGary Shiffman : Yeah. I think, Jamie, the complex and compound question there based on the clear motives of the short seller, if you will. But based on those motives, as I said in my remarks earlier, the board through the Audit Committee really took the matter seriously and engaged an independent third-party law firm to conduct an investigation and provided a very thorough report to the Audit Committee and the board. And as you either read or heard today, the investigation concluded. There have not been any changes to our financial reporting practices. I determined that we've complied with proper disclosure obligations. The board, I would say, has what I would call the correct facts on all of the matters, is very well advised. And as I said, it's my understanding, the board feels that we complied with all of the proper disclosures and obligations. So that's where we really came out on it. And nothing really to report on its impact to any ongoing work that's being done or anything that we're sharing with you today.\nJamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you for that color. And then I guess, as you think about potential G&A savings, you've got Safe Harbor, which is kind of a stand-alone entity in terms of full G&A and its own management team. How do you think about that as an opportunity to cut G&A and cut savings? Like do you think that gets folded even more into the platform in this process? Or you like the current structure, how it stands.\nGary Shiffman : No, it's a great question. We continue to believe in the strength of the platform and the long-term opportunities in the marina sector. As we said, we've had outstanding growth over the last two, three years at a level greater than we think it will sustain at. It will continue to grow and the management team is doing a great job. But as we previously discussed, we need a more -- we expect a more normalized level of growth from there. So as recently as yesterday, I've talked to Baxter, and we're discussing how they can contribute strategically to the cost-savings effects. And we will be working together on that project as we go forward and share those changes as we're able to do so.\nOperator: We'll go next to David Segall with Green Street.\nDavid Segall: Thank you. I was curious if you could talk about whether there's any attrition you're seeing in the annual RV business.\nFernando Castro-Caratini : David, this is Fernando. On the annual side, we continue to gain occupancy. We have converted nearly 2,000 sites this year. So it would be the third year with expectations in the fourth quarter. It would be the third year running with 2,000 or more conversions per annum. Our renewals are strong within the annual segment. And so we're actually seeing tenure increase on the annual side.\nDavid Segall: Great. Thank you. And can you provide some more color on what changed in the revenue growth assumptions across the business segments?\nFernando Castro-Caratini : Sure. The primary driver, David, as detailed, are connected to the transient side of the business, be that in RV or marina. So that's -- we have lowered expectations for transient RV revenue performance, where we were expecting close to being 10% down to being close to 12% down now for the year. Similar impact as far as less transient demand on the marina side given the delayed return of the larger vessels from the Mediterranean. Other revenue impacts for home sales, we are seeing -- we saw less home sales in September and are forecasting fewer home sales as well in the fourth quarter, largely due to the impact from the storms in Florida and the Southeast. And that is, again, linking to the transient side, less service, retail, dining and entertainment revenue, which is having its flow-through to NOI.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJosh Dennerlein : Hey, guys. I guess just like thinking about like some of where the questions are going and where like people are, I think, really focused on this call, it's a lot on governance. Has there been any discussion about maybe refreshing the board a little bit? So a lot of board members have been there a long time. And then Gary, just like do you think like a new CEO can come in if you're still on the board? Would you consider kind of stepping down? And are you going to remain Chairman of the board?\nGary Shiffman : Okay. Well, taking that one at a time, Josh. I'd remind everybody that we have added and refreshed four new, I think, very qualified board members over the last four years. So the board takes its governance very seriously and has been refreshing the board. We have a board member that will step down at the end of this year. And we are definitely examining continued refresh, especially on the very long-tenured board members to be able to position this company for the next chapter of growth, if you will. So that work continues on. With regard to myself, as I just announced my intention to retire and will be working with the Board on a smooth transition. We'll be having those conversations with the committee in the near future. And as I have answers to that, I'd be glad to share them with you.\nJosh Dennerlein : Okay. Appreciate that. Sorry, if I missed it, did you say which board member's stepping down at the end of the year?\nGary Shiffman : No. The Nominating and Governance Committee works through all of that, and they'll share that as soon as they determine it.\nJosh Dennerlein : Okay. When will we know that?\nGary Shiffman : As soon as they've made that --\nJosh Dennerlein : And will there be more?\nGary Shiffman : Sorry, what?\nJosh Dennerlein : No, no, I guess would it just be one? When I'm looking at like the Board lineup, it's -- you have one board member in there 28 years.\nGary Shiffman : What I stated just a little while ago is that we know that one is stepping down and that there is a deep look at replacing additional long-tenured board members so that we can refresh going forward.\nOperator: We'll go next to Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nOmotayo Okusanya : Yes, good evening everyone. I wanted to drill down a little bit on the ability to kind of flex operating expenses. You had mentioned that maybe there were like some third-party vendors or things like that, you did not flex in time. Hoping you could just give us a little bit more detail about those particular expenses and kind of what happened where there was a breakdown in process or whatever it was that resulted in you not kind of reacting as quickly as you probably would have liked to.\nFernando Castro-Caratini : Sure. with over 500 manufactured housing and RV properties, small incremental expenses across each property can quickly add up to a significant amount, which is impacting our results over the course of the second half of the year. The primary overages stemmed from landscaping, tree trimming and pool repairs. We did achieve our expected targets in payroll and other parts of supply and repair, but these items were -- are higher than originally forecasted.\nOmotayo Okusanya : Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Anthony Hau with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Hau : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I noticed that other expenses was up 25% in the same property portfolio. Can you provide a little bit more color on this?\nFernando Castro-Caratini : Sure, Anthony. Other expenses are mainly related to advertising spend and certainly, right, looking to mitigate the revenue declines. There was advertising spent for the properties. We did not see that convert to transient stays at the portfolio.\nAnthony Hau : Got you. And like what do you think needs to happen for transient RV revenue to bounce back?\nFernando Castro-Caratini : Anthony, I would say, right, transient is a great feeder for our annual side of the business. We continue to reduce the impact that transient can have on the business by continuing to convert. We have converted nearly 9,000 sites over the course of almost four years, which has increased annual sites by over 30% during that time. Transient has underperformed original expectations, but we will continue to look to mitigate the impact from that top line by being laser-focused on expenses as the revenue side has been harder to predict.\nGary Shiffman : Yeah, I would just add that during COVID, we invested in building infrastructure for our transient RV business. We believe it has strong long-term fundamentals. However, as we've talked about in the near to medium term, the market conditions have been much more challenging than we anticipated, leading to continued revenue declines as we give back most of the really outsized growth that we experienced through COVID. So we're managing this, and this was the question before, by flexing expenses as revenues are down. And probably, we would suggest that we did not get the flexed expenses that we should have gotten related to the rapid decline, especially in September with the RV transient properties. But looking forward, we do see strategic value in that transient portfolio because, as Fernando said, it is the feeder for our annual RV income stream growth, which, as we said, continues to grow and really perform well. So we remain focused on reducing that total exposure, but maintaining that part of our transient RV that kind of strengthens and grows the annual piece.\nOperator: We'll go next to Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research.\nKeegan Carl : Yeah, thanks for time, guys. I guess I'm just looking for more color on the G&A reduction next year. And does this contemplate both the new CEO salary as well as the salary for Chairman?\nGary Shiffman : I think that where we stand right now, we have looked at actionable G&A and OpEx expense decreases. And with regard to being able to share forward guidance and how we're thinking about it, we shared the rental rate increases. And historically and especially now with John McLaren back on board, our expectation is controllable expenses. So as we share G&A, we look forward to being able to share bridgeable growth, if you will, when we provide guidance. And a couple of new pages in our presentation that we sent out today, I think, can help walk through the steps, if you will, of how we're thinking about the G&A and OpEx expense growth on top of the other strategic progress that we've made. And then applying rental rate growth and assuming, making assumptions on expenses will help you get to how we're thinking about 2025, which is where we're focused right now.\nKeegan Carl : Got it. I mean so just to be clear, the answer is, I'm assuming no. But I guess we'll pivot to the marina business. I guess I'm just curious what drove the occupancy decline. And I know we've heard a lot in the past about you guys having waiting lists at the vast majority. Is that still true?\nGary Shiffman : There is a waiting list for some size boat at the vast majority of the marinas. The largest piece of the miss is related to the storms, which prevent those superyachts and large vessels from returning to the Mediterranean. As we shared earlier in the year, what we were experiencing was earlier departure than what we budgeted for those large superyacht vessels that generally travel to the Mediterranean for the summer season and then return back across the Atlantic. And they left earlier than we budgeted them and are now coming back later, predominantly because of the storms, the named storms we're familiar with and other tropical storms that take place over the Atlantic or near the Med that keep the boats kind of in bay over there. Because they don't tend to cross the Atlantic when these storms are formed there. So that's been the largest impact.\nOperator: This does conclude today's question-and-answer period. I will now hand the call back over to Gary Shiffman for any additional or closing remarks.\nGary Shiffman : Thanks, operator. And I would take this opportunity for a few remarks to wrap it up tonight. Despite what is a disappointing quarter and outlook for all of us at the company, as I shared before, I really do remain confident in our ability to demonstrate value of core portfolio, and in doing so, make myself, John and the entire management team available to all of you and all of our stakeholders with any follow-up questions. There is a lot of positive that has taken place in our strategic initiatives to return to the type of growth in 2025 that this portfolio and this management team can deliver. As I said earlier, it's never an ideal time for these results. Nevertheless, the quarter was bad. We own it, and we understand the urgency within which to turn it around. And that is what we're focused on, just as we accomplished our strategic goals that we set forth in '24. And I look forward to sharing further results or speaking to any of you on a follow-up call. Thank you, operator.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results, the strategic updates we are announcing and our guidance for 2024. First, I want to emphasize my disappointment in the results we are reporting and our revised outlook for the remainder of the year. As I will discuss, we are acting swiftly to address our underperformance. As communicated, we have been focused on executing our strategic initiatives to position Sun Communities to deliver sustained earnings growth over the long term. The business fundamentals of our portfolio remain strong. And we are confident that by continuing to execute on our strategic priorities, the company will be positioned for growth, thereby demonstrating the long-term value of our assets. These priorities as articulated and executed in 2024 include recycling non-strategic assets, reducing debt and increasing the contribution from annual income streams. We continue to make progress in each of these areas. In the third quarter, we disposed of eight manufactured housing communities for approximately $300 million, along with two manufactured housing land parcels for $37 million, bringing total proceeds from asset sales to $392 million year-to-date. As of September 30, our total debt stood at $7.36 billion, a reduction of approximately $450 million from the end of 2023, and our floating to fixed rate mix currently stands at approximately 6%, down from 21% two years ago. That said, we acknowledge that our third quarter results and our adjusted 2024 guidance are below both our and the market's expectations. And we are very disappointed by our performance. Starting with our board of directors, the entire Sun organization is committed to proactively addressing our challenges and restructuring Sun to unlock the value and earnings potential of our portfolio as we demonstrated for the past two decades. Before I address the acceleration of our strategic plans, I wanted to provide an update on the recent short report issued on Sun. Upon being made aware of the report, the board tasked the Audit Committee to address the matters that have raised. The Audit Committee engaged an independent third-party law firm to investigate the report. After a thorough review, the law firm has concluded its investigation, and there have been no changes to our financial reporting practices and the Audit Committee determined that the company complied with its disclosure obligations. The company reiterates its strong commitment to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and internal controls as well as timely and transparent disclosure in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Evident in our results is the impact of continuing volatility in the transient components of our business, which we have been proactively working to reduce as well as cost pressures. We are not satisfied with our performance and are acting with great urgency. To that end, we undertook a comprehensive bottom-up review throughout the organization and concurrent with today's earnings release, we are announcing a broad repositioning effort to more effectively align the company's operating expense and G&A infrastructure to deliver earnings growth. We have been considering and studying many of these cost-saving initiatives throughout this year, and we are now ready to accelerate their implementation and expansion. I am pleased to announce that John McLaren is returning to the company on a full-time basis as President to oversee this accelerated repositioning and the execution of these initiatives. John has been with Sun for 22 years, was Chief Operating Officer for 14 years and was President for 8 years through 2022. During his time as Chief Operating Officer, John oversaw the integration and operation of almost 350 manufactured housing and RV communities and brought a performance-driven approach with a focus on bottom line operational results. The cost reduction measures include better operating expense management and the implementation of identified efficiencies and savings to the company's cost base. It is expected that these will be achieved primarily through initiatives, including reorganizing our operational structure, streamlining and optimizing our technology systems, implementing more effective asset management to drive efficiencies, maximize revenue and other cost-cutting measures. As of today, we have identified and expect to realize annualized G&A and operating expense savings of between $15 million and $20 million or approximately $0.11 to $0.15 per share as we rebase our cost structure for 2025. I want to emphasize that this is just a starting point, and we will continue to seek additional efficiencies and revenue enhancement opportunities. We anticipate strong rental rate increases in 2025, and this restructuring should allow our top line growth to translate into attractive earnings growth by establishing a sustainable and efficient cost structure. Additionally, as announced this evening, I've informed the board of my intention to retire in 2025, following more than 40 years with the company. I led the company through its $115 million IPO in 1993 as a small manufactured housing REIT with 31 manufactured housing communities. And Sun has evolved into the leading owner and operator of MH and RV and marinas with a market capitalization of approximately $16 billion. I am proud of what we have accomplished and believe it is time to transition the CEO role. The board of directors has a CEO search committee in place led by independent board members, Jeff Blau, CEO of the related companies; and Tonya Allen, President of the McKnight Foundation, to conduct a comprehensive search process to identify and hire a new CEO. Turning to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We are happy to share that none of our team members, residents or guests were injured during these events. We extend our deepest gratitude to our team members for their exceptional care and compassion in supporting our residents and guests, all while managing their own personal challenges in the lead-up and aftermath of the storms. Cleanup crews were deployed immediately and our teams worked swiftly to provide necessary supplies, food and resources. The company continues to assess the overall impact of the storms. Most of the damage was limited to trees, fencing, skirting and carports, while our common buildings and utility infrastructure remained largely unaffected. We have one small RV property that is partially closed, and we anticipate it will fully reopen in early 2025. Similarly, our marina portfolio sustained only minimal damage with some bulkheads and docks requiring relocation or replacement. Overall, our assets weathered the storms well, and we are optimistic in our ability to manage the recovery process efficiently. Our supplemental report provides additional details. While we fell short of guidance this quarter, we still achieved year-over-year growth across our key manufactured housing, annual RV and marina segments. As we look to next year, we believe the strategic initiatives already in place, along with the steps we now are taking will enable reliable growth moving forward. In our manufactured housing segment, nearly 35% of our residents received rent increase notices for 2025 at the end of October with an average increase of 5.2%. For our RV portfolio, annual rates have been established for approximately 55% of sites, reflecting an average growth rate of 5.1%. In the UK, all residents have been informed of a 3.7% rent increase for 2025, and 51% of our marina members have also received notice of a 3.7% rental increase. Importantly, we are positioned in sectors with compelling supply-demand dynamics. The ongoing demand for attainable housing and affordable vacationing continues to be a key driver of our platform's success, fueling organic real property NOI growth. We are not satisfied with the results, and we are leveraging every available tool so our platform reflects the underlying value of our assets, and that it delivers sustainable and reliable earnings growth over time. I will now turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our financial results and guidance. Fernando? Hi, Samir, it's Gary. I think that as we shared in the remarks that, that is a starting point for us. With John McLaren coming on board, he's working closely with the group to evaluate what opportunities there are with regard to additional cost savings. Most of that focuses on the MH, RV side as we continue to look into the other business platforms on the Park Holidays side and working with Safe Harbor to identify additional opportunities and cost savings going forward. So it is a combined amount of both OpEx and G&A savings. Yeah. I think reflecting on this quarter, Wes, in the fourth quarter, we are, as we discussed, extremely disappointed with the results. The primary challenges we had in the quarter were related to the businesses we've identified as more volatile than our core MH business and annual RV business, notably transient RV and marinas, which underperformed. Especially as Fernando said in September going into July and August, we felt much more comfortable with where our results were, but September really did not perform well. So alongside this was some occupancy headwinds, if you will, in the marinas due to the adverse weather effects and the adverse weather effects on home sales in Florida. We moved from ahead of internal guidance early in the quarter to well behind in September. The most disappointing for us was the lack of ability to achieve expense objectives in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, having identified the full scope of those. A lot of those fall under third-party providers where we need to flex better against the reduced revenue in these transient areas and did not accomplish our goals of flexing expenses during the time that we needed to and thought that we would flex them and during this rapid decline in September on the revenue side of the transient business. So there is what we've been focused on and continue to be focused on going forward. And under John's leadership and having the experience, the track record, if you will, the ability to focus on the bottom line, that's where we're concentrating all our efforts with regard to reorganizing and being in position for growth in '25. I think that what I would suggest is the board has always focused on succession planning at all levels. Certainly, they have two great co-chairs in Jeff Blau and Tonya Allen to oversee the committee that's been appointed. They will use a search firm, and they will run a very, very strong process. And I think it would be expected they will look both internally and externally. Hi, Eric, it's Gary. I think in general, our goal as a public company is always to maximize value. So we look at all opportunities, and it's not specific to any one part of the business. So as those opportunities come up, as responsible operators of a public company, we look at everything. Yeah. I think -- thanks for asking, John, because certainly, it is a big decision in my life. After 40 years of building this business with the last 30 as a public company, I've been contemplating my next steps, especially over the last couple of years. At this stage of my life with three children and lots of grandchildren, there are a lot of other things I want to experience. And while I love this business and deeply value its continued success, I'm just confident in the strategic objectives we put in place, and I really am excited with the progress we're making. So having John here to help drive our initiatives was also a key factor in my decision to move forward with a transition. And it is not related to any report or anything like that. It's just the period of time and the fact that starting this process for a company that I co-founded back in 1975, it is certainly bittersweet for me, but I couldn't be more excited about what lies ahead for Sun. It will continue to be the largest single contributor of my net worth. So I remain very, very excited and very positive, if you will, about the growth opportunity for Sun. So I look forward to working with the board and the company on a transition and as the committee runs its search process. But it is a bittersweet moment for me, and I've watched this company, as we talked about earlier, grow, if you will, from a handful of communities 30-plus years ago to what it is today. So I'm pleased at what we've accomplished, and I just do think it's time for a new CEO to step in and take over. Well, that's a great question, and I just want to take the opportunity to talk about the complexity of the company. Unfortunately, the quarter was bad, and we're responsible for it. I've been running the company, as I said, back to 1975 even as a private company. So it's never an ideal time to report these kinds of results. That said, after all these years, I am just very positive, as I said, about the outlook of the portfolio of properties and the business. And I want to take a moment just to say part of the reason for my transition is what we're accomplishing and what we've accomplished. Aside from the results and the repositioning that we're sharing with the market to get back to sustainable profitability, we have been accomplishing simplifying the business, if you will, removing as much complexity as we can step by step. The things that we've talked about, removing our ownership of the that stock in Australia, some of the JVs that we've removed out of, continuing to push towards more budgetable and dependable annual revenue away from the transient revenue, improving the balance sheet. And Fernando talked about what great progress we're making there. Set up the company -- and this is where I feel comfortable, really to be in good hands for a new CEO to step in, especially with John here overseeing a lot of the reorganization while we're looking for that new CEO. So I think the skill set will really be important, but it really will tie into the quality of the assets and the ability, as we've always said, of a portfolio that has great occupancy, has continued ability to increase rental rents every single year and control expenses, which we now know we need to do a better job. So I think there's a wide range. And I think we continue to examine opportunities within the portfolio to remove complexity. And I think that will be a piece of what the new CEO does. Yeah. I think, Jamie, the complex and compound question there based on the clear motives of the short seller, if you will. But based on those motives, as I said in my remarks earlier, the board through the Audit Committee really took the matter seriously and engaged an independent third-party law firm to conduct an investigation and provided a very thorough report to the Audit Committee and the board.

And nothing really to report on its impact to any ongoing work that's being done or anything that we're sharing with you today. No, it's a great question. We continue to believe in the strength of the platform and the long-term opportunities in the marina sector. As we said, we've had outstanding growth over the last two, three years at a level greater than we think it will sustain at. It will continue to grow and the management team is doing a great job. But as we previously discussed, we need a more -- we expect a more normalized level of growth from there. So as recently as yesterday, I've talked to Baxter, and we're discussing how they can contribute strategically to the cost-savings effects.

            "content": "Thank you, Gary. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Sun reported core FFO per share of $2.34. Total North America same-property NOI increased by 0.5%, driven by a 2.8% increase in revenues, offset by a 7.7% increase in expenses. This underperformance relative to our expectations was driven primarily by higher expenses, continued headwinds in transient RV, compounded by the September hurricane further impacting Florida and Southeast transient business and home sales. Here's a closer look by segment. Our core North America manufactured housing business continued to deliver growth, with same-property NOI increasing by 5.3% year-over-year. Although our revenue growth was strong, we faced elevated expenses, primarily due to higher supply and repair costs. Despite these pressures, our year-to-date growth remains strong at 6.6%, reaffirming the long-term fundamentals of the segment. The RV segment faced top line and expense challenges this quarter, leading to a 6.9% decline in same-property NOI, largely attributed to a 10.4% reduction in transient revenue. While we were tracking generally in line with guidance for the first two months of the quarter, transient revenue and resultant NOI underperformed in September. Despite this, our annual RV business remains strong with nearly 900 sites converted from transient to annual this quarter, accounting for 85% of total revenue-producing site gains year-to-date. So far this year, we have completed almost 2,000 transient-to-annual conversions, further increasing our recurring income stream, supported by long-term occupancy and revenue stability. Supply and repair and utility costs were elevated in the quarter, driving underperformance beyond the transient revenue headwinds. In our marina segment, same-property NOI increased by 2.5% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. The segment faced pressures from the delay of large vessel returns from the Mediterranean due to storms, including Helene and lower overall occupancy. Also, similar to our MH and RV segments, we experienced higher-than-expected operating expense pressures, further impacting marina NOI performance in the quarter. We have invested strategically in our marinas, including the acquisition in the third quarter of one marina and one bolt-on for approximately $52 million, primarily funded through the issuance of common OP units. These additions expand our member networks and enhance our capabilities and customer experience. In the UK, overall occupancy increased by 110 basis points from the prior year, while timing factors related to residents leaving and new owners moving in led to a same-property NOI decline of approximately $700,000 or 2.3% this quarter. A key year-over-year expense driver was higher payroll costs stemming from a UK national minimum wage increase of approximately 13% this year. Despite this, the segment shows positive momentum with increased rental rates and vacation revenue driving year-to-date same-property NOI growth of 7.7%. There remains some broader uncertainty around UK fiscal policy and the macroeconomic outlook, but we are encouraged by our positive momentum driven by higher rental rates. Additionally, home sales revenue rose 5.2% compared to last year with stable margins. SRD&E NOI came in below expectations, primarily linked to softer transient demand in the RV and marina segments. Core FFO contribution from North American home sales was lower than expected in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Helene in Florida, prior to which we were ahead of internal expectations for July and August. During the quarter, in relation to Hurricane Helene, we recognized $2.2 million of impairment charges for assets at 5 MH and RV communities and $1.7 million for assets at 9 marinas with impacted properties located in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. On October 9, Hurricane Milton impacted some of the company's properties in Florida. The company responded promptly and cleanup and restoration efforts are underway. We believe we have adequate insurance coverage, including property, casualty, flood and business interruption and at this time, do not anticipate a significant adverse impact on operating results or financial condition. Impairment estimates are based on current information and may adjust as assessments continue. As it relates to our balance sheet, we continue to advance our capital recycling strategy, selling eight manufactured housing communities for approximately $300 million and two MH land parcels for $37 million. We also reduced non-recurring capital expenditures, down approximately $255 million through September versus 2023, reflecting a nearly 50% year-over-year decrease. Additionally, we settled all forward sales agreements with respect to 2.7 million shares of common stock under our at-the-market program. This activity took place during August and the first days of September and resulted in net proceeds of approximately $362 million. Combined proceeds from asset sales and the ATM program were used to pay down secured debt and our revolving line of credit, strengthening our balance sheet for sustainable growth going forward. As compared to 2023 year-end, we have approximately $450 million of less debt on our balance sheet today. As of September 30, SUN's debt balance stood at $7.36 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and a weighted average maturity of 6.4 years. Our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio is 6 times. We are continuing to evaluate non-core asset and land parcel capital recycling opportunities to continue to focus on our core portfolio and our deleveraging path. Turning to updated 2024 guidance. We are adjusting our full year core FFO per share guidance to a range of $6.76 to $6.84, a reduction of 4.8% at the midpoint from our prior expectations. This reflects the impact of third quarter underperformance and the continuation of headwinds in the business, inclusive of transient RV revenue and higher expenses for the fourth quarter. We are reducing North American same-property NOI guidance by 225 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 2.6% to 3.3%. Summarizing the changes by segment. Manufactured housing same-property NOI expectations are reduced to a range of 5.6% to 6.2%, primarily driven by higher expenses across supply and repair and utilities. RV same-property NOI expectations are reduced to a range of negative 5.3% to negative 4.1%. The change is primarily driven by continued headwinds in transient RV revenues and higher expense expectations, primarily in supply and repair and utilities. Full year transient RV revenue is now expected to decline by 11.9% at the midpoint versus July expectations of a 10.3% decline due in part to an impact from Helene and Milton on our Florida assets and the broader Southeast RV portfolio. Marina same-property NOI expectations are reduced to a range of 4.4% to 5.2%. The change is primarily driven by occupancy declines, including the delayed returns of large vessels to the U.S. from the summer and fall boating season in Europe, in part due to weather patterns. Expenses are running higher than originally expected, mainly in payroll. For our UK same-property portfolio, we are reducing NOI growth expectations to a range of 7.1% to 8.7%, primarily due to the move in timing of new owners and higher expenses in supply and repair and payroll. Service, retail, dining and entertainment NOI, primarily linked to transient demand in RV and marina, is expected to experience continued headwinds into the fourth quarter. FFO contribution from North American home sales expectations are also lower, reflecting fewer sales expected in Florida and the Southeast due to hurricane activity. These headwinds are anticipated to be partially offset by higher-than-expected UK income tax refunds. As reflected in our updated guidance, we are anticipating some specific headwinds for the remainder of this year. However, we continue to see stability in our core business and are constructive on our outlook beyond 2024 as we realize the impact of our accelerated and expanded initiatives. Importantly, this is supported by the strong rental rate increases that we expect to see next year of 5.2% in manufactured housing, 5.1% in annual RV and 3.7% in the UK and marina segments. We also anticipate annualized operating and G&A expense savings of between $15 million to $20 million or approximately $0.11 to $0.15 per share on a run rate basis, as well as interest expense savings from lower current and expected year-end debt balances versus 2024. Finally, as we have discussed, we continue to focus on our reliable real property income and reducing transient exposure while materially reducing our non-recurring capital expenditures and selectively recycling assets for further debt paydown. For additional details regarding our updated full year guidance, please see our supplemental disclosures. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through November 6, but it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator? Hi, Samir, this is Fernando. We are continuing to evaluate single asset, small portfolio and non-income producing land potential dispositions for capital recycling. As outlined in the investor presentation that we put out this evening, there's potential for an additional $100 million to $200 million over the near term. Sure, Nick. The largest driver in the non-recurring piece of G&A is an insurance receivable that was written off in the quarter from a legal settlement in -- prior to this period. The other components of the non-recurring, we had an additional $2.5 million of deal costs and severance expenses in the quarter. On the recurring side, the main driver of the increase is payroll related. So Michael, the run rate expense savings that we've detailed will be on a 2025 basis. And that -- so it would be from the recurring piece of G&A. David, this is Fernando. On the annual side, we continue to gain occupancy. We have converted nearly 2,000 sites this year. So it would be the third year with expectations in the fourth quarter. It would be the third year running with 2,000 or more conversions per annum. Our renewals are strong within the annual segment. And so we're actually seeing tenure increase on the annual side. Sure. The primary driver, David, as detailed, are connected to the transient side of the business, be that in RV or marina. So that's -- we have lowered expectations for transient RV revenue performance, where we were expecting close to being 10% down to being close to 12% down now for the year. Similar impact as far as less transient demand on the marina side given the delayed return of the larger vessels from the Mediterranean. Other revenue impacts for home sales, we are seeing -- we saw less home sales in September and are forecasting fewer home sales as well in the fourth quarter, largely due to the impact from the storms in Florida and the Southeast. And that is, again, linking to the transient side, less service, retail, dining and entertainment revenue, which is having its flow-through to NOI. Sure. with over 500 manufactured housing and RV properties, small incremental expenses across each property can quickly add up to a significant amount, which is impacting our results over the course of the second half of the year. The primary overages stemmed from landscaping, tree trimming and pool repairs. We did achieve our expected targets in payroll and other parts of supply and repair, but these items were -- are higher than originally forecasted. Sure, Anthony. Other expenses are mainly related to advertising spend and certainly, right, looking to mitigate the revenue declines. There was advertising spent for the properties. We did not see that convert to transient stays at the portfolio. Anthony, I would say, right, transient is a great feeder for our annual side of the business. We continue to reduce the impact that transient can have on the business by continuing to convert. We have converted nearly 9,000 sites over the course of almost four years, which has increased annual sites by over 30% during that time. Transient has underperformed original expectations, but we will continue to look to mitigate the impact from that top line by being laser-focused on expenses as the revenue side has been harder to predict."

At this time, management would like me to inform you that certain statements made during this call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can provide no assurance that its expectations will be achieved.

The company undertakes no obligation to advise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release. Having said that, I’d like to introduce management with us today, Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Fernando Castro-Caratini, Chief Financial Officer; and Aaron Weiss, Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development. After the remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, management asks that you limit yourselves to one question, so everyone who would like to participate has ample opportunity. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the call over to Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin.\nGary Shiffman: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results in 2024 guidance. Sun is pleased to report a solid second quarter. Core FFO per share of $1.86 was in line with guidance, driven by same property NOI growth of 3.6% in North America and 9.3% in the U.K. Manufactured housing, our largest segment, generated same property NOI growth of 6.4% in the quarter, driven by strong rental rate growth and occupancy gains. We continue to benefit from the strong demand versus supply dynamics embedded in manufactured housing. In RV, same property NOI decreased 4.6%. The decline was driven by weakness in the transient RV segment and we are seeing continued demand headwinds. Importantly, due to our ongoing transient-to-annual conversion strategy, we have fewer site nights available for transient guests. While we were able to partially offset revenue underperformance by managing expenses, and were even able to hold transient RV margins flat to budget, the cost reductions did not fully mitigate the revenue impact. Our strategic focus on transient-to-annual conversions increases the contribution of revenue from annual property agreements, improves RV NOI margins over time and increases occupancy. Since 2020, we have now completed approximately 8,000 conversions, increasing the number of annual RV sites by approximately 30%. These RV conversions supported strong occupancy gains, as our same property adjusted occupancy for MH and RV increased by 150 basis points to 98.7% as of June 30, 2024. Additionally, our revenue-producing sites increased by over 1,200 sites in the quarter, compared to a 1,000-site increase in the prior year. We are very pleased with Marinas same property results, as the business achieved 6.1% NOI growth, in line with our guidance. Demand for the Safe Harbor network’s unmatched locations, premium amenities and expert services remains strong. While we are seeing superyacht Transatlantic movement earlier than originally forecast, Marina business fundamentals remain strong, and Safe Harbor continues to actively manage its operating expenses. Our strategy in the U.K. remains focused on increasing real-property NOI and decreasing the contribution from home sales. With six months ended June 30, 2024, real-property NOI in the U.K. accounted for 55% of total U.K. NOI, up from 42% during the first six months of 2023. On a same property basis, U.K. NOI grew 9.3% over the second quarter last year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong year-over-year revenue growth was in line with our expectations, and the outperformance was driven primarily by lower-than-expected utility expenses. U.K. home sales were in line with expectations through May, before slowing in the run-up to England’s elections and the related concerns regarding fiscal policy. Early third quarter trends indicate that that uncertainty surrounding the elections is dissipating, and buyer interest is increasing from some headwinds we experienced in June. Overall, for the second quarter, U.K. home sales FFOs were within our expected range. In terms of other strategic initiatives, we are very pleased to share that since our last earnings call in April, we’ve sold eight properties, bringing total asset sale proceeds year-to-date to over $300 million. We’ve used net proceeds to pay down debt, reducing our leverage ratio to 6.0 times on a pro-forma basis. We are laser-focused on maximizing Sun’s performance by increasing the revenue contribution from annual income, active expense management, non-strategic asset recycling and debt reduction. As we continue to convert more RV sites from transient-to-annual, grow the base of occupied sites at Park Holidays and reduce leverage, Sun is positioned to generate long-term attractive FFO per share growth. Before handing the call over to Fernando, I’d like to acknowledge and thank each Sun, Safe Harbor, and Park Holidays team member for their hard work, dedication and continued support in delivering our results. Fernando?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you. As Gary mentioned, one of our key priorities is to delever by disposing select non-strategic assets, remaining disciplined in our non-recurring CapEx spend and allocating free cash flow to debt reduction. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the sale of seven communities for a combined $263 million. Operationally, these transactions allow us to exit non-core markets and provide operational efficiencies going forward. The communities were encumbered with $79 million of mortgage loans, which were paid off at closing, improving our secure debt-to-total asset ratio. We used the remaining net proceeds of $171 million to reduce borrowings on our senior credit facility. During the second quarter, we also sold one Park Holidays property for $5.4 million. Adjusting our June 30th results solely for the July dispositions and the associated debt repayment, our pro forma net debt-to-trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio is approximately 6.0 times and we remain focused on continuing to improve this metric. Importantly, these properties were sold on an FFO accretive basis with reduced interest expense offsetting loss of income from the assets. For the first half of 2024, our non-recurring property capital expenditures are down approximately 47% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we are on target with reducing 2024 non-recurring CapEx spend by approximately 50% from last year’s levels. I’ll now walk through our guidance for the remainder of the year. Second quarter Core FFO per share of $1.86 was in line with our guidance range. We are reaffirming prior guidance for full year Core FFO per share of $7.06 to $7.22 and establishing third quarter guidance in the range of $2.46 per share to $2.56 per share. Total real property NOI is 80 basis points lower for 2024 at the midpoint of guidance, primarily reflecting the recent asset sales and the resultant loss of income from these properties. Interest expense guidance is $6.5 million lower at the midpoint after paying down debt using the net proceeds generated from the asset sales. North America, we are maintaining the prior midpoint of expected same property NOI growth for the full year at 5.2% and narrowing the range to 4.7% to 5.7% growth over the prior year. Note that 2023 and year-to-date 2024 actual results have been adjusted in same property NOI for historical and guidance purposes to exclude income from properties disposed of during the year. MH is performing well and we forecast continued strength from this segment. Our revised same property NOI growth range for this segment of 6.8% to 7.4% represents a 50 basis points increase at the midpoint of prior guidance. For same property RV NOI, we are reducing our prior full year guidance to incorporate recent operating trends. Second quarter, RV transient revenues decreased 12% underperforming the 8% decline we expected. Our revised same property NOI range of negative 0.7% to positive 0.9% is 40 basis points below the midpoint of prior full year guidance. Embedded in our guidance for same property RV are approximately 1,700 transient-to-annual converting. Year-to-date, we have converted approximately 1,100 sites and are on pace to achieve our full year target. We believe in the long-term attractiveness of the transient RV business where the five-year site adjusted revenue CAGR is 5.6% and we are excited about the pipeline of annual conversions it will continue to provide in the coming years. Our prior Marina guidance assumes some Transatlantic migration by superyachts. Thus far, this migration is occurring earlier than expected. Safe Harbor continues to manage variable expenses to match revenues as demonstrated by second quarter results. We are lowering our same property NOI growth expectations for the full year by 30 basis points at the midpoint to a new range of 6.2% to 7.2% to reflect current dynamics with that large vessel movement. U.K. real property continues to outperform as our strategy on increasing real property NOI bears fruit. We expect a strong performance to continue in the second half of the year and are increasing the midpoint by 250 basis points. Overall, U.K. home sales have been in line with expectations. While July results show positive momentum, we did see some softness in the sales pipeline in June ahead of the elections and are lowering U.K. home sales FFO contribution by $850,000 at the midpoint based on current trends and expectations for the remainder of the year. With regards to G&A, reflecting continued focus on corporate expense rationalization, we are decreasing the midpoint by approximately $5 million or 210 basis points, reflecting an expected increase of 2.5% at the midpoint, compared to prior guidance of 4.6% growth for the full year. For additional details regarding our updated full year guidance, please see our supplemental disclosures. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through July 31st, but it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital market activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Your line is now live.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. $260 million of dispositions announced in the quarter. You did another $50 million or so prior to the quarter. That brings you to $300 million, which is in line with your last capital recycling program. So, my question here is, are you looking to do more dispositions from here and if you can provide some information around the cap rates of the property sold, that would be really helpful? Thank you.\nGary Shiffman: Thanks for your question, Michael. It definitely is on plan, as we shared in 2014. We did about a $300 million disposition program, so we are right on target there. We do have several other select dispositions in the market right now. We continue discussion over those and they are the similar type assets where, in this case, the six MH properties that we sold actually remove us from single states, where we just had one single MH property, or four states, I should say. So, real efficiency is there and as we look at these other properties that we are offering in the market, similar strategy with regard to the fact that they are not strategic locations and they could help to improve operating efficiencies as we go forward. So, I would refer to them as opportunistic, non-strategic asset sales, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nBrad Heffern: Yeah. Hey, everybody. Can you give an update on the U.K. loan collateral and if any of those assets are potentially among the assets that you are looking to monetize in the near term?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hey, Brad. Thank you for the question. No. Those assets that were collateral for the U.K. loan are not part of those potential dispositions. As we detailed during our call and Investor Conference -- call in April and Investor Conferences since then, the Park Holidays team has taken over the operations of those and we are excited to see them continue to produce.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Samir Khanal from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nSamir Khanal: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Hey, Gary. Maybe you can elaborate on this Marina business being down 30 basis points. You kind of mentioned those large vessel movements. Can you talk around that a little bit? And I guess what gives you the confidence to say that a 30-basis-point cut is enough at this time? Thanks.\nGary Shiffman: Thanks, Samir. Well, certainly, as we do at all our businesses, we build from the bottom up. We remain very positive about continued near- and long-term FFO growth for our Safe Harbor Marinas business, and in fact, investor demand in the asset class itself has never been greater. So embedded in our revised guidance is this adjustment in Marinas in the second half is, we really see these large superyacht vessels heading towards the Transatlantic and the Med movement. Just as Fernando said earlier than forecasted, so we did forecast this, but there has been a fair amount of pent-up demand through COVID. These boats have been more stationary, and I think with all that’s on the agenda over in the Med, including the Olympics and things like that, there’s just been earlier departure. These boats go back and forth across the Atlantic, and we do have the historical numbers to take a look at how things do return. We have built in the fact that with America’s Cup taking place over on the other side of the Med this year, these boats will probably return where we might expect them in August, September. We’re more likely to see them come back in late September, early October.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pawlowski from Green Street. Your line is now live.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for the time. A question on the U.K. business. I just want to better understand what’s going on on the ground in terms of the meaningful shift in the same-store revenue guide and meaningful decline in expenses. So we started the year, real property revenue is expected to grow roughly 5%. Now it’s tracking towards 7%. Expenses were expected to grow by 8%, but tracking towards 4%. Just some on the ground operating color from what’s happening in that portfolio?\nGary Shiffman: I’ll start out, and then Fernando can add some specifics. But looking at the U.K. operating environment, we are feeling better than we have as inflation is running at 2%, and overnight, Bank of England announced a cut of rates of about 25 basis points. So these macro trends, if you will, are positive for our consumer and should bode well for our U.K. operating businesses, which are actually seeing in our real property performance. So, big picture, things look positively improving there. We believe our continued focus on increasing real property contribution over home sales profit is the best strategy in creating stakeholder value. So, we remain really focused on increasing occupancy and increasing real property contribution. And I turn it over to you, Fernando for…\nFernando Castro-Caratini: And John, for more specifics as it relates to revenue and expenses, I’ll remind everyone, the same property pool for the U.K., its total contribution in 2023 was about $70 million. So, a small dollar amount can have a large change from a percentage basis, but we are seeing the outperformance coming both from the topline and then expense side. On the topline, we’re seeing our new owners at higher rates than originally forecasted. And then from an expense perspective, and this applies to the first half of the year, as well as the second, we have seen lower utility and forecast lower utility costs than we’d originally expected. Those are going to be the largest drivers of that continued outperformance and what has allowed us to take guidance upward as meaningfully as we have over the course of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nJosh Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey, guys. Gary, I just wanted to follow up on your comment on the superyacht movement. You said you expect the boat -- some of the superyachts to start to come back in October after the America’s Cup. It looks like the America’s Cup ends late October. Was that just misspeaking or is that when you kind of assumed the boats to come back?\nGary Shiffman: Yeah. Just speaking -- I was just commenting that they usually come back late August, September, and due to America’s Cup, there’ll probably be a month or two delay in them coming back, and we took that into account in the approximately $750,000 reduction at the midpoint related to that.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. So I guess current guidance assumes kind of like a November return.\nGary Shiffman: Yes. Correct.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. Okay. Just wanted to clarify. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Eric Wolfe from Citi. Your line is now live.\nEric Wolfe: Hey. You mentioned that the dispositions were done on an FFO accretive basis, but it looks like you took down your real property NOI by around $10 million and the interest expense was taken down by about $6.5 million. So I was just curious whether there was something else in that real property NOI other than just those dispositions? Thanks.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Hey, Eric. This is Fernando. Yes. There is -- there are some shifts as it relates to performance over the course of the second quarter. For the rest of the portfolio, we did our same property growth was at 3.6%, slightly below the midpoint of the range. So it does have some shifts as it relates to that and movements in our non-same property pool, which would account for any acquisitions that were done last year or any of our development assets that are in the process of stabilization.\nEric Wolfe: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Gary, you mentioned the BOA -- BOE interest rate cut. I imagine that’s going to lead to higher demand for Park Holidays. But I was wondering how you’re going to manage home sales from not being a bigger contributor to FFO going forward. We noticed that margins also increased during the quarter on home sales. So how are you going to balance that demand versus home sales not being a big part of earnings going forward?\nGary Shiffman: So I think that I would share with you, John, that we have a great operating team with a strong 10-year history on the portfolio, best-in-class assets there. So we will -- we have put together a forecast that reduces margins and increases velocity of occupancy. It’s in our forecast. So there will be a continued delicate balance if we were to see we have more room to reduce margin, we will reduce margin, and our goal of creating stickier revenue, if you will, and more valuable revenue on the real property side.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: And John, I’ll add, while our -- right the business plan is to continue reducing the percentage contribution from home sales, it is -- it feeds getting more owners and it is leading to that outperformance that we’re seeing on the real property side. So home sales will continue to be part of the business just like it is here in the U.S. It is a larger contributor on a percentage basis than in the U.S., but we’ll continue to manage those sales, manage the margins to accelerate velocity, and that ultimately will result in more reliable income on the real property side.\nJohn Kim: So you’re saying that buyers are willing to take a lower price but with longer term on the land rental or maybe a higher rent than land rental?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: No. Just saying that accelerating, right, sales ultimately lead to more owners paying rent on the real property side. So it is our sales funnel, as many of the -- many of our guests that vacation with us end up purchasing a holiday home within our property. So that is the interplay between the home sales and the real property or rental income side of the business.\nGary Shiffman: So the residents, if you will, pay their pitch fee or their rent fee, but they’re on annual contracts. So in reducing margin and making these more attractive, we expect to accelerate the velocity of occupancies, John.\nJohn Kim: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Keegan Carl from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\nKeegan Carl: Yeah. Thanks for the time, guys. Just wondering if you could give some more color in your transient RV outlook for the balance of the year, just more color on how July 4th in particular performed.\nGary Shiffman: For -- and Fernando, if you have a little bit of pacing information to share and everything like that, I just remind everybody that we remain laser focused on converting transient-to-annual. Obviously, over long periods of time, the margins are better, the predictability, the forecasting and the budgeting. We have about 25,000 transient sites right now with approximately 2,000 a year conversion average. So, we expect over the next five years to convert 10,000 or more sites. And we’re just very pleased to say that we’ve had a lot of success in converting and it’s really leading to a sticky revenue as we can forecast annual much better average 10-year stay right around six years. And I’ll let Fernando respond to how the holiday is going.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Yeah. So, Keegan, transient revenue for the full year is now expected to decline by about 10% for the year, which implies, call it a decline of about 8.8% for the second half of the year. The 4th of July results and pacing for Labor Day have given us comfort that the revenue decline is more muted in the second half as the results that we saw during the first half, because it’s when more transient-focused resorts are at peak occupancy and these have performed closer to original expectations this year. For the 4th of July, we were down about 7% on revenue. That’s an out note, right? We’ve converted over the trailing 12-month period, we converted around 7% of sites from transient-to-annual. When you’re comparing just the 4th of July day, we were up over 24% for just the 4th of July day. As it relates to Labor Day pacing, we’re currently pacing it being down between 4% to 6% on revenue for the weekend.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. So, when we met with your team at NAREIT, there was a lot of talk around bigger picture potential, either spinoffs or sales, whether it was a Safe Harbor spinoff or things to do with the U.K. business. It sounds like now you’re on the path of stick with all the core businesses, sell some non-core assets. Is that the way to think about this? Kind of a lot was discussed at the Board level and you guys are now thinking the plan is let’s enjoy what we’ve got, maximize NOI margins and get to our leverage targets through asset sales, or is there something else that may be coming down the pike?\nGary Shiffman: Well, Jamie, I would say that, we certainly wouldn’t share anything of major consequence. We operate all of our business platforms to increase FFO growth, real property contribution over home sales, as we indicated both in the U.K. and in the U.S., maximize returns and conversions by transient-to-annual, and continue to grow contribution and FFO growth in the Marina segment. That being said, we’re just laser focused, as I said before, on our strategies that we’ve shared with you. We believe they will create stakeholder value. That said, we’ll continue to evaluate all options, and when I think about how we’re looking forward, I’d suggest we’re just starting to see the benefit of our strategic plan translate into NOI growth, and I think, what we tried to get across when we met last is the fact that without the headwinds of what we’ve gone into, into 2024, the 2025 will be a much better year where we can see NOI growth translate into FFO growth, and for now, that’s really what we’re targeted at. So nothing really new or changed that I would suggest in a recent period of time.\nJamie Feldman: When you think about potential options, is there anything that would get in the way of your current trajectory for 2025 growth?\nGary Shiffman: There is nothing that I see that would change how we’re evaluating and working towards 2025.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nGary Shiffman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Just to stick on transient RV, again, it’s been very hard for the entire industry to kind of forecast what that’s going to look like for all year. And I guess at this point, when you think about that business, what are some of the signs or the green sheets you’re looking at to kind of make you feel more confident about it, ultimately, quote-unquote, stabilizing? And when do you think you may actually start to see some of those signs?\nAaron Weiss: Well, I’ll start out, Gary, and you can add Fernando. So I think Fernando shared the 5% CAGR growth in the transient segment over the last five years. And as we think about things, certainly we’ve shared a lot about the benefit of converting transient-to-annual. So that’s been very, very favorable as we move forward. The transient sites today, as I said, we’re converting about 2,000 a year. So good growth there. And I think that we see RV over a long period of time as a very, very good business. The transient has some cyclicality to it. We’re pushing through that right now. We’re probably headed for the pre-COVID levels. And we’ll continue to control expenses, manage the variable expenses that we can. I think the benefit of really having best-in-class, well-located RV communities and a great operating platform to go forward. The last thing I’d add is that the transient is a great funnel for conversions. So the transient portfolio helps us in the profit margin that we get on the annual side of things and the growth we get on the annual side.\nFernando Castro-Caratini: Yeah. I was just going to reaffirm, right? Our strategy of conversion continues to minimize the impact in the near-term of any short-term volatility on the transient side. That business, on a site-adjusted basis, as I mentioned, has grown at an over 5% CAGR on the revenue side. But that, right, we will continue to minimize. Transient revenues four years ago represented about 60% of total revenues in our same property pool. They’re now approaching 40%. And so our strategy is bearing fruit. We’re seeing continued demand for conversions. And then that family is with us, on average, for a six-year period of time and we’re hard at work to continue to extend that tenure. So it is all part of the strategy to continue minimizing that near-term impact.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Got you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mason Guell from Baird. Your line is now live.\nMason Guell: Good afternoon, everyone. Regarding the line of credit balance, it looks like there’s over £1 billion on the line. Are there any plans to pay down these U.K. borrowings?\nFernando Castro-Caratini: We are consistent with the strategy as it relates to capital recycling and free cash flow conversion that we would look to continue to pay that down. That is our immediate use of proceeds for any capital recycling opportunities or free cash flow is the pay down of short-term borrowings on our credit facility.\nMason Guell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back over to Gary for any further closing comments.\nGary Shiffman: Well, we thank everybody for their participation and we do look forward to sharing with you third quarter results. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results in 2024 guidance. Sun is pleased to report a solid second quarter. Core FFO per share of $1.86 was in line with guidance, driven by same property NOI growth of 3.6% in North America and 9.3% in the U.K. Manufactured housing, our largest segment, generated same property NOI growth of 6.4% in the quarter, driven by strong rental rate growth and occupancy gains. We continue to benefit from the strong demand versus supply dynamics embedded in manufactured housing. In RV, same property NOI decreased 4.6%. The decline was driven by weakness in the transient RV segment and we are seeing continued demand headwinds. Importantly, due to our ongoing transient-to-annual conversion strategy, we have fewer site nights available for transient guests. While we were able to partially offset revenue underperformance by managing expenses, and were even able to hold transient RV margins flat to budget, the cost reductions did not fully mitigate the revenue impact. Our strategic focus on transient-to-annual conversions increases the contribution of revenue from annual property agreements, improves RV NOI margins over time and increases occupancy. Since 2020, we have now completed approximately 8,000 conversions, increasing the number of annual RV sites by approximately 30%. These RV conversions supported strong occupancy gains, as our same property adjusted occupancy for MH and RV increased by 150 basis points to 98.7% as of June 30, 2024. Additionally, our revenue-producing sites increased by over 1,200 sites in the quarter, compared to a 1,000-site increase in the prior year. We are very pleased with Marinas same property results, as the business achieved 6.1% NOI growth, in line with our guidance. Demand for the Safe Harbor network's unmatched locations, premium amenities and expert services remains strong. While we are seeing superyacht Transatlantic movement earlier than originally forecast, Marina business fundamentals remain strong, and Safe Harbor continues to actively manage its operating expenses. Our strategy in the U.K. remains focused on increasing real-property NOI and decreasing the contribution from home sales. With six months ended June 30, 2024, real-property NOI in the U.K. accounted for 55% of total U.K. NOI, up from 42% during the first six months of 2023. On a same property basis, U.K. NOI grew 9.3% over the second quarter last year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong year-over-year revenue growth was in line with our expectations, and the outperformance was driven primarily by lower-than-expected utility expenses. U.K. home sales were in line with expectations through May, before slowing in the run-up to England's elections and the related concerns regarding fiscal policy. Early third quarter trends indicate that that uncertainty surrounding the elections is dissipating, and buyer interest is increasing from some headwinds we experienced in June. Overall, for the second quarter, U.K. home sales FFOs were within our expected range. In terms of other strategic initiatives, we are very pleased to share that since our last earnings call in April, we've sold eight properties, bringing total asset sale proceeds year-to-date to over $300 million. We've used net proceeds to pay down debt, reducing our leverage ratio to 6.0 times on a pro-forma basis. We are laser-focused on maximizing Sun's performance by increasing the revenue contribution from annual income, active expense management, non-strategic asset recycling and debt reduction. As we continue to convert more RV sites from transient-to-annual, grow the base of occupied sites at Park Holidays and reduce leverage, Sun is positioned to generate long-term attractive FFO per share growth. Before handing the call over to Fernando, I'd like to acknowledge and thank each Sun, Safe Harbor, and Park Holidays team member for their hard work, dedication and continued support in delivering our results. Fernando? Thanks for your question, Michael. It definitely is on plan, as we shared in 2014. We did about a $300 million disposition program, so we are right on target there. We do have several other select dispositions in the market right now. We continue discussion over those and they are the similar type assets where, in this case, the six MH properties that we sold actually remove us from single states, where we just had one single MH property, or four states, I should say. So, real efficiency is there and as we look at these other properties that we are offering in the market, similar strategy with regard to the fact that they are not strategic locations and they could help to improve operating efficiencies as we go forward. So, I would refer to them as opportunistic, non-strategic asset sales, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time. Thanks, Samir. Well, certainly, as we do at all our businesses, we build from the bottom up. We remain very positive about continued near- and long-term FFO growth for our Safe Harbor Marinas business, and in fact, investor demand in the asset class itself has never been greater. So embedded in our revised guidance is this adjustment in Marinas in the second half is, we really see these large superyacht vessels heading towards the Transatlantic and the Med movement. Just as Fernando said earlier than forecasted, so we did forecast this, but there has been a fair amount of pent-up demand through COVID. These boats have been more stationary, and I think with all that's on the agenda over in the Med, including the Olympics and things like that, there's just been earlier departure. These boats go back and forth across the Atlantic, and we do have the historical numbers to take a look at how things do return. We have built in the fact that with America's Cup taking place over on the other side of the Med this year, these boats will probably return where we might expect them in August, September. We're more likely to see them come back in late September, early October. I'll start out, and then Fernando can add some specifics. But looking at the U.K. operating environment, we are feeling better than we have as inflation is running at 2%, and overnight, Bank of England announced a cut of rates of about 25 basis points. So these macro trends, if you will, are positive for our consumer and should bode well for our U.K. operating businesses, which are actually seeing in our real property performance. So, big picture, things look positively improving there. We believe our continued focus on increasing real property contribution over home sales profit is the best strategy in creating stakeholder value. So, we remain really focused on increasing occupancy and increasing real property contribution. And I turn it over to you, Fernando for... Yeah. Just speaking -- I was just commenting that they usually come back late August, September, and due to America's Cup, there'll probably be a month or two delay in them coming back, and we took that into account in the approximately $750,000 reduction at the midpoint related to that. Yes. Correct. So I think that I would share with you, John, that we have a great operating team with a strong 10-year history on the portfolio, best-in-class assets there. So we will -- we have put together a forecast that reduces margins and increases velocity of occupancy. It's in our forecast. So there will be a continued delicate balance if we were to see we have more room to reduce margin, we will reduce margin, and our goal of creating stickier revenue, if you will, and more valuable revenue on the real property side. So the residents, if you will, pay their pitch fee or their rent fee, but they're on annual contracts. So in reducing margin and making these more attractive, we expect to accelerate the velocity of occupancies, John. For -- and Fernando, if you have a little bit of pacing information to share and everything like that, I just remind everybody that we remain laser focused on converting transient-to-annual. Obviously, over long periods of time, the margins are better, the predictability, the forecasting and the budgeting. We have about 25,000 transient sites right now with approximately 2,000 a year conversion average. So, we expect over the next five years to convert 10,000 or more sites. And we're just very pleased to say that we've had a lot of success in converting and it's really leading to a sticky revenue as we can forecast annual much better average 10-year stay right around six years. And I'll let Fernando respond to how the holiday is going. Well, Jamie, I would say that, we certainly wouldn't share anything of major consequence. We operate all of our business platforms to increase FFO growth, real property contribution over home sales, as we indicated both in the U.K. and in the U.S., maximize returns and conversions by transient-to-annual, and continue to grow contribution and FFO growth in the Marina segment. That being said, we're just laser focused, as I said before, on our strategies that we've shared with you. We believe they will create stakeholder value. That said, we'll continue to evaluate all options, and when I think about how we're looking forward, I'd suggest we're just starting to see the benefit of our strategic plan translate into NOI growth, and I think, what we tried to get across when we met last is the fact that without the headwinds of what we've gone into, into 2024, the 2025 will be a much better year where we can see NOI growth translate into FFO growth, and for now, that's really what we're targeted at. So nothing really new or changed that I would suggest in a recent period of time. There is nothing that I see that would change how we're evaluating and working towards 2025. Sure. Well, we thank everybody for their participation and we do look forward to sharing with you third quarter results. Thank you."

            "name": "Fernando Castro-Caratini",
            "content": "Thank you. As Gary mentioned, one of our key priorities is to delever by disposing select non-strategic assets, remaining disciplined in our non-recurring CapEx spend and allocating free cash flow to debt reduction. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the sale of seven communities for a combined $263 million. Operationally, these transactions allow us to exit non-core markets and provide operational efficiencies going forward. The communities were encumbered with $79 million of mortgage loans, which were paid off at closing, improving our secure debt-to-total asset ratio. We used the remaining net proceeds of $171 million to reduce borrowings on our senior credit facility. During the second quarter, we also sold one Park Holidays property for $5.4 million. Adjusting our June 30th results solely for the July dispositions and the associated debt repayment, our pro forma net debt-to-trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio is approximately 6.0 times and we remain focused on continuing to improve this metric. Importantly, these properties were sold on an FFO accretive basis with reduced interest expense offsetting loss of income from the assets. For the first half of 2024, our non-recurring property capital expenditures are down approximately 47% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we are on target with reducing 2024 non-recurring CapEx spend by approximately 50% from last year's levels. I'll now walk through our guidance for the remainder of the year. Second quarter Core FFO per share of $1.86 was in line with our guidance range. We are reaffirming prior guidance for full year Core FFO per share of $7.06 to $7.22 and establishing third quarter guidance in the range of $2.46 per share to $2.56 per share. Total real property NOI is 80 basis points lower for 2024 at the midpoint of guidance, primarily reflecting the recent asset sales and the resultant loss of income from these properties. Interest expense guidance is $6.5 million lower at the midpoint after paying down debt using the net proceeds generated from the asset sales. North America, we are maintaining the prior midpoint of expected same property NOI growth for the full year at 5.2% and narrowing the range to 4.7% to 5.7% growth over the prior year. Note that 2023 and year-to-date 2024 actual results have been adjusted in same property NOI for historical and guidance purposes to exclude income from properties disposed of during the year. MH is performing well and we forecast continued strength from this segment. Our revised same property NOI growth range for this segment of 6.8% to 7.4% represents a 50 basis points increase at the midpoint of prior guidance. For same property RV NOI, we are reducing our prior full year guidance to incorporate recent operating trends. Second quarter, RV transient revenues decreased 12% underperforming the 8% decline we expected. Our revised same property NOI range of negative 0.7% to positive 0.9% is 40 basis points below the midpoint of prior full year guidance. Embedded in our guidance for same property RV are approximately 1,700 transient-to-annual converting. Year-to-date, we have converted approximately 1,100 sites and are on pace to achieve our full year target. We believe in the long-term attractiveness of the transient RV business where the five-year site adjusted revenue CAGR is 5.6% and we are excited about the pipeline of annual conversions it will continue to provide in the coming years. Our prior Marina guidance assumes some Transatlantic migration by superyachts. Thus far, this migration is occurring earlier than expected. Safe Harbor continues to manage variable expenses to match revenues as demonstrated by second quarter results. We are lowering our same property NOI growth expectations for the full year by 30 basis points at the midpoint to a new range of 6.2% to 7.2% to reflect current dynamics with that large vessel movement. U.K. real property continues to outperform as our strategy on increasing real property NOI bears fruit. We expect a strong performance to continue in the second half of the year and are increasing the midpoint by 250 basis points. Overall, U.K. home sales have been in line with expectations. While July results show positive momentum, we did see some softness in the sales pipeline in June ahead of the elections and are lowering U.K. home sales FFO contribution by $850,000 at the midpoint based on current trends and expectations for the remainder of the year. With regards to G&A, reflecting continued focus on corporate expense rationalization, we are decreasing the midpoint by approximately $5 million or 210 basis points, reflecting an expected increase of 2.5% at the midpoint, compared to prior guidance of 4.6% growth for the full year. For additional details regarding our updated full year guidance, please see our supplemental disclosures. As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through July 31st, but it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital market activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator? Hey, Brad. Thank you for the question. No. Those assets that were collateral for the U.K. loan are not part of those potential dispositions. As we detailed during our call and Investor Conference -- call in April and Investor Conferences since then, the Park Holidays team has taken over the operations of those and we are excited to see them continue to produce. And John, for more specifics as it relates to revenue and expenses, I'll remind everyone, the same property pool for the U.K., its total contribution in 2023 was about $70 million. So, a small dollar amount can have a large change from a percentage basis, but we are seeing the outperformance coming both from the topline and then expense side. On the topline, we're seeing our new owners at higher rates than originally forecasted. And then from an expense perspective, and this applies to the first half of the year, as well as the second, we have seen lower utility and forecast lower utility costs than we'd originally expected. Those are going to be the largest drivers of that continued outperformance and what has allowed us to take guidance upward as meaningfully as we have over the course of the year. Hey, Eric. This is Fernando. Yes. There is -- there are some shifts as it relates to performance over the course of the second quarter. For the rest of the portfolio, we did our same property growth was at 3.6%, slightly below the midpoint of the range. So it does have some shifts as it relates to that and movements in our non-same property pool, which would account for any acquisitions that were done last year or any of our development assets that are in the process of stabilization. And John, I'll add, while our -- right the business plan is to continue reducing the percentage contribution from home sales, it is -- it feeds getting more owners and it is leading to that outperformance that we're seeing on the real property side. So home sales will continue to be part of the business just like it is here in the U.S. It is a larger contributor on a percentage basis than in the U.S., but we'll continue to manage those sales, manage the margins to accelerate velocity, and that ultimately will result in more reliable income on the real property side. No. Just saying that accelerating, right, sales ultimately lead to more owners paying rent on the real property side. So it is our sales funnel, as many of the -- many of our guests that vacation with us end up purchasing a holiday home within our property. So that is the interplay between the home sales and the real property or rental income side of the business. Yeah. So, Keegan, transient revenue for the full year is now expected to decline by about 10% for the year, which implies, call it a decline of about 8.8% for the second half of the year. The 4th of July results and pacing for Labor Day have given us comfort that the revenue decline is more muted in the second half as the results that we saw during the first half, because it's when more transient-focused resorts are at peak occupancy and these have performed closer to original expectations this year. For the 4th of July, we were down about 7% on revenue. That's an out note, right? We've converted over the trailing 12-month period, we converted around 7% of sites from transient-to-annual. When you're comparing just the 4th of July day, we were up over 24% for just the 4th of July day. As it relates to Labor Day pacing, we're currently pacing it being down between 4% to 6% on revenue for the weekend. Yeah. I was just going to reaffirm, right? Our strategy of conversion continues to minimize the impact in the near-term of any short-term volatility on the transient side. That business, on a site-adjusted basis, as I mentioned, has grown at an over 5% CAGR on the revenue side. But that, right, we will continue to minimize. Transient revenues four years ago represented about 60% of total revenues in our same property pool. They're now approaching 40%. And so our strategy is bearing fruit. We're seeing continued demand for conversions. And then that family is with us, on average, for a six-year period of time and we're hard at work to continue to extend that tenure. So it is all part of the strategy to continue minimizing that near-term impact. We are consistent with the strategy as it relates to capital recycling and free cash flow conversion that we would look to continue to pay that down. That is our immediate use of proceeds for any capital recycling opportunities or free cash flow is the pay down of short-term borrowings on our credit facility."

Welcome to the Sun Communities First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. \n At this time, management would like me to inform you that certain statements made during this call, which are not historical facts may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can provide no assurance that its expectations will be achieved.

This company undertakes no obligation to advise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release.  \n Having said that, I'd like to introduce management with us today. Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Fernando Castro-Caratini, Chief Financial Officer; and Aaron Weiss, Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.  \n I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Gary Shiffman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shiffman, you may begin. \nGary Shiffman: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on our conference call to discuss first quarter 2024 earnings and our updated guidance. We're pleased to report solid first quarter results underpinned by strong operational performance in each of our businesses. Core FFO per share of $1.19 for the quarter was driven by robust 7.9% year-over-year growth in North American same-property NOI and strong U.K. same-property NOI growth.  \n Our first quarter results underscore how the favorable dynamics of high demand and limited supply, inherent in our best-in-class portfolio generate resilient real property income. Same-property manufactured housing NOI increased 8% compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to several factors, including rental rate increases, occupancy growth and lower expenses. Same-property RV NOI increased 8.1%, primarily reflecting the positive impact of converting transient sites to annual leases, and continued expense savings that partially offset lower transient revenues. Same-property Marina NOI grew 7.5% compared to the prior year.  \n The outperformance was driven by continued strong demand for wet slips and dry storage as well as strong rental rate increases. As we enter our third full year of ownership of our U.K. portfolio, this segment is now included in our same-property reporting. U.K. same-property NOI in the quarter was approximately $11 million, which is a strong start to the year. We remain focused on our capital recycling strategy. And as disclosed on our last earnings call, have sold 2 manufactured housing properties. Currently, we have in the market with additional assets and feel positive about our ability to transact.  \n In terms of capital deployment, Sun continues to be highly selective. Year-to-date, Sun has acquired several bolt-on Marina properties for approximately $12 million that strategically enhance our Marina member network on the East Coast. We recently published our sixth annual ESG report. Key highlights include completing our inventory methodology for reporting scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions and a 73% increase in team member volunteer hours compared to 2022.  \n Additionally, we continue to prioritize our dialogue and interactions with our stakeholders and to work with our supply chain partners to understand their ESG programs. We continue to execute on a plan, focused on delivering earnings growth from a reliable real property income. I would like to thank our talented team members for their continued dedication and strong performance and all our stakeholders for their continued support. \n I will now turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our results and guidance in more detail. Fernando? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Gary. In the first quarter, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share of $1.19, driven by strong real property revenue growth and our continued focus on managing expenses. In North America, total same-property NOI for the quarter grew 7.9%, driven by a 6% increase in revenues and a 2.2% increase in expenses, further detailing each segment.  \n Same-property manufactured housing reported another solid quarter with an 8% increase in NOI compared to 2023. The NOI was driven by a 6.8% increase in revenue and expense growth of 3.4%. For same-property RV, its 8.1% NOI growth was driven by a 3.1% increase in revenue and a 1.8% decrease in expenses. The year-over-year decline in RV operating expenses was due to aligning controllable costs with transient revenues, notably in payroll and utilities. Occupancy for same-property manufactured housing and RV, adjusted to include expansion activity, increased 180 basis points year-over-year to 98.9%. Part of the uplift in occupancy can be attributed to conversions of transient to annual RV sites. \n For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2024, Sun converted over 1,750 transient sites to annual contracts accounting for approximately 65% of our revenue-producing site gains. We are continuing our strategic focus on converting transient to annual sites. Since the start of 2020, we have completed nearly 7,100 conversions and have increased the number of annual sites by approximately 27%. Marina's posted another strong quarter with same property NOI increasing 7.5% compared to 2023. This was driven mainly by rate increases for wet slips and dry storage spaces across the portfolio and stronger transient demand, resulting in a 7.1% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 6.5% increase in expenses, primarily driven by payroll.  \n In the U.K. same property NOI increased by $3.3 million, representing a 44.5% increase over 2023 same-property results, higher rental rates increased customer retention and the early timing of the Easter holiday break drove a 12.3% increase in revenue in the quarter. Property operating expenses decreased 1.7% year-over-year primarily reflecting timing differences for supply and repair and payroll costs. \n First quarter U.K. home sales volumes were in line with expectations. We sold more than 620 homes representing a 5.4% increase compared to the previous year. FFO contribution was $10.2 million for the quarter, reflecting the strong sales volume, offset in part by lower margins. The strong unit sales performance in the first quarter will lead to an increase in community occupancy and site rent for the year. This aligns with our strategic objective to shift a larger share of our U.K. business activity from home sales to real property rents. Regarding capital allocation, Sun remains extremely disciplined, pursuing limited strategic opportunities. As Gary indicated, we recycled approximately $52 million of proceeds from selling 2 assets this year and acquired 4 highly strategic Marinas for approximately $12 million. \n Turning to our balance sheet. On March 31, 2024, the company had approximately $7.8 billion in net debt outstanding and our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio was 6.1x. We remain focused on further enhancing our balance sheet strength. During the quarter, Sun issued $500 million of 5-year senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 5.5%. Net proceeds were used to pay down borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility. \n During the quarter, we also paid off our corporate term loan with our revolving credit facility. Our weighted average debt maturity is 6.8 years, and our variable rate debt was approximately 11% at the end of the quarter. We intend to use free cash flow from operations and proceeds from planned asset sales to reduce overall leverage and variable rate debt percentages. As detailed in yesterday's release, we are updating our 2024 guidance for first quarter results as follows: we narrowed our full year core FFO per share guidance to a range of $7.06 to $7.22. \n We are also establishing guidance for the second quarter of 2024 core FFO per share in the range of $1.83 to $1.91. For our total portfolio, we expect real property NOI growth in the range of 6.5% to 7.3%. Higher expected NOI growth in MH and Marinas should offset lower expected NOI from RV. In North America, the updated full year same property growth range is 4.6% to 5.8%. The 40 basis point reduction at the midpoint is primarily due to transient RV revenue headwinds. \n Revised expectations are 6.2% to 7.1% for manufactured housing, a 15 basis point increase at the midpoint, negative 0.3% to 1.3% for RVs, a 230 basis point decrease at the midpoint driven by transient RV revenue headwinds, which we are partially offsetting with controllable expense reductions, and 6.4% to 7.6% for Marinas, a 20 basis point increase at the midpoint.  \n In the U.K., we forecast approximately the same total FFO contribution for the year, but with a greater contribution now expected to come from real property results. We are increasing our full year same property NOI forecast from the prior range of 1.3% to 3.3% to a new range of 6% to 8%. The increase is driven by greater expected rental revenues complemented by continued cost management efforts. The higher real property revenue outlook is a function of the previously implemented rental rate increases and higher home sales volume and retention achieved year-to-date.  \n For U.K. home sales, we maintain our range of expected volume for the year, but expect lower FFO contribution due to lower margins. Our U.K. strategy remains focused on shifting a larger proportion of our income from home sales margins into the resilient, reliable NOI generated by real property rents. Overall, we are pleased with our operating performance, expense management, and minimizing capital spending over the course of this year. Please refer to our supplemental for additional guidance information.  \n As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through April 29, but it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. \n This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. \nMichael Goldsmith: It seems like you guys have been able to convert the strategy for -- in the U.K. from generating the bulk of the -- or you've been able to convert from generating a lot of the NOI from home sales, and you've made progress on generating it more from rent growth, like how are you able to achieve that in such a short period of time that it kind of influenced the guidance in such a large way. \nGary Shiffman: Thanks for the question, Michael. The U.K. business overall is performing generally in line with expectations. There has been a strategy that -- you mentioned that we've indicated from the time we acquired the acquisition that we look to sacrifice a little bit of the margin on home sales to be able to create a more sticky, dependable real property income in the form of pitch fees there. And it is working very, very well, in first quarter, I think, is a good example of it. \n That being said, there are still economic pressures and headwinds in the U.K. while we're up in volume and overall growth. U.K. very much like what we're seeing in the U.S. is probably not seeing the benefits of interest rate reductions as soon as they might have been anticipated a while ago. So the bottom line is, I think that we'd be in a position to be even excelling further, and we expect to be doing so as we go through the year and into the future. And we'll continue to sacrifice a little bit of that margin to gain the real property revenue. It's been working so far, and we expect it to continue to do so. \nMichael Goldsmith: And my follow-up question is, there were several moving pieces in the 2024 expectations, and that came 2 months after issuing your initial outlook 2 months ago. So as we look forward from here, do you sit here and think, okay, now we've got a much better grasp on the year sitting in the middle of spring. And so there shouldn't be as much volatility with the guidance going forward? \n Or at this point in the year, could there still be kind of large shifts within the expectations going forward? I'm just trying to gain a better understanding of where the visibility is into the year at this point? \nGary Shiffman: It's certainly a question we can relate to and understand as we move forward to a very focused plan on taking the underpinning and the incredible performance, if you will, of our business platform and translating it into growth for our shareholders. We're working very, very hard on a number of different areas that we've shared previously, certainly, the simplification, the recycling of capital, and many of the things that we've accomplished over the last couple of quarters. All in an effort, and this includes the continued conversions of transient, where it is harder to forecast out transient RV into annual agreements in our RV communities.  \n All this and the approach that we've taken to looking hard at first quarter and knowing that it's the lowest contributor across the Board first and fourth quarters to our overall FFO performance. We feel comfortable with the adjustments that we made will leave us in the best position to really deliver the results that we're sharing with you today. \nFernando Castro-Caratini: And Michael, while they're certainly are moving pieces to the guidance, we did reiterate our FFO guidance per share with the second quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. \nJohn Kim: Just wanted to follow up on the FFO guidance, which you maintained, but when you look at the non-same-store real property items, it looks like a $0.15 reduction in your outlook. Part of that is higher G&A but that's another question. But how confident are you to make -- that you can make up that $0.15 or 2% of FFO in your same-store portfolio? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: John, the G&A move upward from guide to guide. That's from a GAAP perspective. So that does not include some add backs that we have for FFO, mainly deal costs and transaction costs, of which there were just over $11 million in the quarter. The transaction expenses related to finalizing the receivership process related to the Royale Life note and investor engagement during the first quarter. So while there is -- on the guidance page, there is an increase from guide to guide in G&A. Our net of those add-backs, we are still expecting at the midpoint our G&A to grow by about 4.6%, again at the midpoint. \nJohn Kim: And the other items, I mean, maybe my second question is your RV guidance was the only part that went down on your same-property outlook you had 8% growth in the first quarter. So you're basically implying it's going to go negative for the rest of the year. I realize that the transient to seasonal or annual conversion, but typically, you get a big uplift in revenue when you make that conversion. So what is driving that reduction in the same-property RV outlook? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: And John, you're seeing the uplift of that occupancy gain on the annual side with just over 13% growth for that line item in the first quarter. The movement or the guide downward on the RV side is primarily due to the transient headwinds as mentioned earlier, where we will look to offset as much of it as possible by -- with controllable expense cost reductions.  \n The -- our forecast set in February for our guidance implied a 2.6% reduction in transient revenue for the year. That is -- that was including the impact of conversions, as mentioned, that is currently with all the information that we have in front of us as it relates to pace, shorter booking windows, that is currently expected to be about 8% reduction for the year. So that is the largest mover on the RV side. Overall, when you take that into consideration with our Manufactured Housing platform and Marina platform, the guide downward on the NOI side is about $4 million. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. \nJoshua Dennerlein: Maybe just wanted to touch on the asset sales and just like how that marketing process is going. \nGary Shiffman: Well, Josh, we certainly got off to a good start and shared the 2 assets that we did sell. We are currently in the market. And there are a number of opportunities that we feel very good within the selected assets that we offer for dispositions. Again, these are assets that we feel will benefit somebody else in the long run.  \n And there are still buyers out there. There are those that are looking to build platforms and looking past the negative leverage, if you will. But there is definitely a shift in the marketplace with debt costs being higher than they had been for the last long period of time. We look forward to being able to share with everybody the results of these dispositions that we have in the market right now. And hopefully, we'll be able to do that in this coming quarter. \nJoshua Dennerlein: I appreciate that, Gary. And then I just wanted to follow up on Michael's question about the guidance. When I think about your guides, it almost seems like every line item, the range was revised. Just maybe stepping back and thinking big picture, how do you -- like what's your philosophy on providing these guidance ranges. \nFernando Castro-Caratini: We're looking to provide as much disclosure as possible to the market as it relates to all of the -- all of our business platforms and other line items. So you can -- with the guidance, you can track almost entirely P&L. We did add guidance in February as it related to expected interest expense which had not been provided previously. So that is that's looking to provide as much color as possible to the market as it relates to our expectations, those expectations, some shift upwards, some shift downwards as you're seeing with the guidance provided last night. But it's the best information that we have in front of us today to provide to you and the rest of the market. \nGary Shiffman: Josh, the only thing that I would add to that is the fact that we certainly got through a lot of challenges in '23, have had some headwinds in '24 as we've shared with everybody. But I've also shared a strong desire to be simplifying and assisting with the ability to model. So we continue to do a lot of work on that.  \n And as we go through '24, some of the steps that are taking place, I think, will put us in a cadence be able to provide an understanding and information as we go forward. A good example is U.K. home sales, where we will sacrifice the margin and made a decision and management is actually executing on the decision to increase volume at the cost of a little bit of margin to add to real property income. They've done an outstanding job at Park Holidays. We really want to commend them on that. And it's things like that, that are causing adjustments. But I think as we continue quarter-by-quarter, we'll take a cadence that will feel much better. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. \nBrad Heffern: Is there any color that you can give about the pace at which you expect to move NOI out of the U.K. home sales business and into real property going forward? Should we continue to see sort of big chunky moves like this as the year goes on? Or does the guidance kind of fully reflect the underlying change in strategy? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: The guidance fully reflects the underlying change -- or not a change in strategy, but the continuation of that strategy of shifting more right, more income into the reliable real property side. \nBrad Heffern: Okay. And is there any color you can give on kind of the pace at which we should expect that to happen? Obviously, in the U.S., home sales are not a big contributor. Is there visibility on that happening in the U.K. over the next 5 years or 3 years? Or any sort of framework you can give us around the speed at which you can accomplish the transition? \nGary Shiffman: Brad, are we talking about the U.K.? \nBrad Heffern: Yes, for the U.K. \nGary Shiffman: Again, I'd kind of reiterate what Fernando said in the fact that even going back to when we announced the acquisition, we had a strategy recognizing that the model in the U.K. is different than it is in the U.S. And we would sacrifice margin for increase in occupancy and gaining that more sticky dependable, if you will, and modelable is such a word, FFO on the real property side. So what you're seeing is a continuation on that.  \n We -- in '23, definitely hit headwinds of a slowing economy that caused that to accelerate faster than our 5- or 7-year plan originally had it. But I would say right now, where we're at, we're right on target where we want them to be, with Park Holidays. And I think you'll just continue to see us hit guidance and if things should improve or if we have an opportunity to make more rapid, we would definitely share that in the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Robert W. Baird. \nWesley Golladay: I just want to go back to the transient forecast. Can you unpack that a little bit? What has driving the EBITDA adjusted for the conversions? Are you seeing any rate pressure? And then when you have your forecast for the balance of the year, are you extrapolating the current trends into the balance of the year? \nGary Shiffman: Wes, we continue to believe in the long-term strength of the overall RV sector. And as you know, we've been strategically reducing our transient exposure and relative contribution over the past few years in favor of the stability of the growth of the annual agreements that we're really, really focused on.  \n So we've increased the annuals by about 27% by converting the transient since 2020. And our expectation and our outlook moving forward, if you'll continue to see that. And again, that allows us to budget and forecast with a higher degree of confidence as we have those homes in on an annual basis, and they're not subject to the concerns of whether, again, much of the transient is within a 3-hour drive of the home base of our guests. And so weather conditions as we saw in April. And as we've seen more recently in the last couple of years, do impact that short-term transient guest stability to be able to forecast it.  \n So I think that while it's a good business, and we will continue to have a percentage of it, we will continue to focus on converting those transient over to annuals. And we're seeing stronger and stronger demand, and we're opening up more and more of our transient sites and will allow them to be converted to annual. \nWesley Golladay: Yes. No, I get all that. Just maybe looking at the transient forecast, so it did come down about 6% -- 5% or 6%. And I'm just wondering if there's a rate pressure or is it just occupancy? And is it mainly just the current trends that you're seeing and are you extrapolating that into the second half of your forecast? Just trying to get a sense of maybe how conservative the guide is maybe a little too conservative as weather potentially impacting the guide at the moment? \nGary Shiffman: Yes. I would just suggest, as Fernando mentioned, certainly, pace has a lot to do with it. We're seeing it 8% down year-over-year. There is concept that says the shorting booking windows will yield the potential for upside, but in our efforts to give the best guidance that we can going forward. We're looking at outpacing is right now. \n I don't know if Fernando of you have anything to add. \nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then maybe going to the U.K. Is there any onetime items that hit the first quarter? And then anything in the forward guidance. And maybe just can you confirm that there's the price -- lowering the pricing to build those sticky income on the real property, that's nothing new that you changed this year, year-to-date is something that you've been doing all along. \nGary Shiffman: I'll answer the first part, and Fernando can talk about guiding forward. But the strategy of shifting margin for occupancy gain has been our strategy all along. As I indicated before, it more rapidly accelerated in 2023 as we brought margins down due to the headwinds of the economy. \n But what you're seeing right now is continued strong demand for the Park Holidays community and a management team that from day 1, understood the concept of being able to increase occupancy and increase real property contribution over the concept of the onetime sales margin that probably worked much better for them as the portfolio was owned by private equity firms in the past. So it's pretty much it exactly where we want it to be now, and we're hoping to continue it and really make a difference in how we're going to look long term at the value creation, if you will, of the real property contribution. \nFernando Castro-Caratini: And then, Wes, on aggregate, the total FFO contribution from Park Holidays for 2024 is in line with original expectations. Park Holidays contribution to core FFO also includes SRD&E through retail and F&B operations and head office personnel and corporate activities on the G&A side. in the first quarter and for the year included in the overall contribution to core FFO was an expected payroll tax withholding that refund and third-party costs related to securing this refund.  \n These various items had a net impact of about $2 million to our aggregate $153 million of core FFO in the first quarter or much larger for the rest of the year. These changes are similar and consistent with, call it, it's akin to real estate tax or sales tax or other expense changes that are periodically, reflected, updated treatment of revenue or expense. These changes are sometimes favorable or unfavorable to the current period. \nWesley Golladay: Okay. And so just the bottom line that is a contract expense you had. And so the U.K. real property revenue is just a true upward lift in, on the full year. \nFernando Castro-Caratini: Yes. It was on same property is and that is detailed during the call, is primarily driven by the higher rental rates, higher retention than expected and we did see a stronger Easter break, which also the comp on a year-over-year basis where Easter was during the second quarter in 2023. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. \nKeegan Carl: Maybe first, I guess, just on your acquisition of the land parcels. It was a bit surprising given your comments on development and expansion last quarter. So I guess I'm just curious what changed on this front. \nGary Shiffman: Yes. I think we've talked about being very, very strategic in our thinking with use of capital. And we've also shared the plan that we're looking to both recycle capital and dispositions as well as through cash flow by shutting down development and using that cap will pay down more costly debt on a rate basis. \n I think that when you have 500 to 600 properties that are very, very strategically located and the strategic piece of land or opportunity comes about, we take advantage of that, thinking about the long-term nature of Sun. And all you're seeing there is, as you saw in the Marinas. There are just some bolt-on opportunities where we have a very, very low cost, a great deal of potential value creation in the future, and those are just one-off strategic opportunities, small in nature. \nKeegan Carl: And then shifting gears here on home sales, I guess, both in the U.S. and U.K., maybe U.K. first. I know you mentioned margin. Is it just a function of mix? Like are you selling more used homes to new homes? Or is it just lower general pricing. Is there any update on Sandy Bay as well as those are higher-priced homes? And then in the U.S., I know that outlook was reduced too. Is it explicitly tied to existing home sales? Or is there something else we should be aware of? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: Keegan, on the U.K. side, that's a mix of both of pricing and mix shifting more towards the pre-owned side of sales. Sandy Bay is ramping up well as it relates to marketing efforts for sales heading into a busier season over the course of the next couple of months. \nGary Shiffman: Yes. On the U.S. home side, Keegan, really given the high occupancy of which our MH properties operate and our strategic shift away from deploying capital into that development and expansion. We did guide towards much lower home sales this particular year. And that is something I think that just demonstrates a little bit of the strength that we're seeing at nearly a 98% occupancy in the MH and annual communities. \nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Wolfe with Citibank. \nEric Wolfe: As you look at your guidance, I was just wondering if there's anything in the core numbers that is sort of onetime in nature, one way or the other. So for instance, it seems like there might have been a tax refund in the U.K. same-store NOI this quarter. Just trying to understand if there's anything in this year's core FFO that won't be repeated next year as we think about the right sort of base from which to project things in 2025. \nFernando Castro-Caratini: Eric has detailed a little bit earlier in the quarter and budgeted this way contribution in the U.K. included a VAT refund on the real property side. It included additional expenses or higher expenses given payroll tax withholding and costs associated with securing that refund. The net of those figures is about $2 million for the quarter or for the year. \n But consistent with this is akin to say real estate tax assessments, right, where we may pay a little bit more, given the assessment that we get from the state. And if there's -- if we are able to work through that assessment, we might be at a refund in a later period. It's similar and consistent with that practice. \nEric Wolfe: Yes, that makes sense. I guess I was just trying to make sure there was nothing else. I mean so it sounds like just net like maybe $2 million and understood on the reason for it, I just want to make sure that when we're projecting out to 2025, there's nothing else that would sort of distort those numbers. I guess second question on the recurring CapEx. It looks a little bit high relative to last year's quarterly average. Just wondering if we should expect it to come down? And then also, I saw that there's a decrease in sort of acquisition CapEx, but still a bit of this sort of bolt-on investment to former acquisitions. I guess, when should we expect that to come down as well? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: Thank you, Eric. The spend on the recurring CapEx side is consistent, and we do have higher CapEx -- recurring CapEx on the Marina side and on the U.K. side during the first quarter of the year. So that spend is expected to moderate over the rest of the year as it relates to total nonrecurring CapEx for the quarter, it does represent about a 45% reduction as compared to the first quarter of last year. And is expected to ramp up as we've discussed with the market, our spend on CapEx is expected to be somewhere around 55% reduction to the figures that you saw spend in 2023. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. \nAnthony Powell: I guess another question on transient RV. I understand that you're trying to convert many of those sites to annual, but you still have a meaningful amount of transient sites. So I'm curious, are there any trends that you can employ to maybe improve growth there? And what's your optimal annual transient split in that business? \nGary Shiffman: I think answering the second part of your question. First, we talked about reducing transient from high 20,000s to about 14,000, 15,000 over a 3-, 4-, 5-year period of time, transient sites to be our best in transient properties as well as the feeder to continue to feed annual RV guests as they move out. So we're making good, good progress there. And with regard to other opportunities, I think on the social media side, on the marketing side, we've been very, very focused. \n I think that there's been a lot of talk about the incredible growth through COVID and the return to pre-COVID periods of time. We're really just focused, if you will, growing from where we are and we have engaged a number of third parties who have hospitality experience, looking at different forms of revenue management, different forms of looking for business activity, in the shoulder parts of the week, in the shoulder seasons. \n So we're very, very focused. And I do believe that there is opportunity than near to long term to really enhance the transient pool of properties and sites that we have, we're also what is left in the portfolio becomes the best of the transient. So there's an opportunity as well as we continue to convert to see longer to midterm kind of improvements in growth than we're seeing right now. But there's no -- nothing specific that I could point to that would tell you that it's leading directly to an anticipated change. \nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. \nJames Feldman: I guess just focusing on the balance sheet. Can you just remind us your deleveraging or leverage objectives and floating rate debt objectives in terms of those metrics? And can you also give us some thoughts on the glide path to get there? What do you think it takes to get to your goal? And how long do you think it takes to get to your goals for both of those items? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure, Jamie. As we've stated previously, our long-term leverage targets are to be at 5.5x and below. Today, we are at 6.1x from a leverage perspective. Growth in EBITDA over the course of the year should provide deleveraging by the end of the year as well, as Gary had stated before, we have multiple opportunities from a capital recycling standpoint that we trust we'll update the market with over the course of the next couple of months and quarters that should also contribute towards reaching and surpassing that goal of 5.5x. Floating rate debt today as of the end of the quarter was just above 11%, we will look to manage that percentage to be below 10%. So that's something that we can do here over the course of the short term. \nJames Feldman: Okay. And just to confirm, the 5.5x, you're saying by year-end? Or no, that's going to take much longer. \nFernando Castro-Caratini: That takes us into 2025 from that standpoint. \nJames Feldman: Okay. And then I guess just taking a step back, over the last 9 months, year, a lot of new initiatives at the company. You added 2 new board members. You took the plan to simplify earnings. I think whether it was NAREIT meetings in November or end of year conference call discussions, it seemed like you had ring-fenced a lot of the concerns on the U.K. and some of the problems that certainly the market was concerned about. \n So you look today, you guys maintained your guidance. Your core business actually seems a little bit better than expected when we started the year, but the stock is underperforming by almost 600 basis points to REITs. Can you just talk about maybe looking behind the curtain of what's going on at the company and some of the initiatives that your Board is debating, your management team is debating, your company is debating about ways to address the problem, fix the problem. Just maybe things that we, on this side of the fence don't necessarily have a view on that people can look forward to as they think about this company and what's to come the year ahead. \nGary Shiffman: Sure. I think I'd share and really reiterate the thoughts related specifically to that, which the goal to create simplification up and down throughout the company. The company has grown a lot, complexities certainly crept in. And as we've discussed previously, we're really making good progress along those lines with regard to the Board, we're pleased with the addition of the new board members. We're pleased with the setup of the committees going forward. We're doing well through our disposition program and recycling that capital. \n We've talked about one of the JVs that we've been able to simplify greatly that we shared the Northgate properties last quarter. We've talked about stepping out of the headstock in Australia, and we've sold off our interest in the proprietary software for managing our RV communities, although we still use it, great software Campspot. And at the same time, the conversions that are taking place that we've spent a lot of time talking about today and other days, allow us to manage our business much better to bring the cost margins, are greater in the annual properties than they are in the transient properties, which will translate to future growth as well. \n I think that the strategy that is working well in the U.K. right now with regard to moving more of the volatile home sales margin into real property income. The fact that we've been able to get through the foreclosure process on the assets in the U.K. and have Park Holidays manage them. In particular, the great job they're doing at Sandy Bay. We're excited to share the results of how things are shaping up over there. So these are all the things that the Board and the managed team are -- management team are focused on. It also gives me the opportunity to mention that we have Aaron Weiss sitting in on our call today, we brought in 2 years ago. \n So as an effort to broaden our executive team and our bench. I think that we're really excited to be able to demonstrate how the simplification and approach to everything is going to translate into FFO growth as Sun has been known for it historically. But of course, we realize that we have a ways to go to demonstrate it through 2024, gain some of that lost credibility back. And we're working very, very hard and very, very diligently to do so. And I think it's just underpinned by the really outstanding performance of the business platform, and we continue to work hard and share more of that information quarter-by-quarter with you. \nJames Feldman: Very helpful and lots to think about. I guess just  one quick follow-up, if you don't mind, just because we get asked this a lot. I mean how long does it take for whatever initiatives, even if all the initiatives you've put in place at year-end or all the initiatives you're going to do? Like how long does it really take for it to have the full impact. \nGary Shiffman: Well, I'm going to suggest what we talked about at NAREIT and some of the conferences in our calls that 2024 isn't without its headwinds. We talked a lot about the specific financial headwinds and the simplification paths that were taking place. Our real goal is to look at 2025 when most of these headwinds that we can identify are behind us, and we can really, really begin to translate the very strong core business growth into -- growth to our shareholders. So while there is upside and there is a risk to everything as we go through the year, we all know it's still a challenged economy with a lot of uncertainty in there. As far as what we can control in the company, we feel like we'll be in a very, very good position, finishing out '24 and going into '25. \nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Hau with Truist Securities. \nAnthony Hau: Given that you brought sales margin down in the U.K., are you seeing more buyers, homeowners buying premium lodges compared to before? And what percentage of buyers are buying standard versus premium today? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: Anthony, our -- we have brought margin expectations down for the year by about $2,600, that is helping drive more preowned lodge sales that premiumization or those upgrade sales is something that we will continue to work with our customers that have bought a preowned home over the course of the last couple of years and are looking to upgrade. So that is part of the strategy as it relates to that higher retention that we've been discussing as it relates to our homeowners across the portfolio. \nAnthony Hau: And when you upgrade a home from like standard to premium, you increased your pitch fee by 3x, right? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: It's going to depend, Anthony, on the size of that home and that site and where that site is in the portfolio. But yes, there is usually a premiumization, not just from the sale of the home, but also on the pitch fee side. \nAnthony Hau: Okay. And just one quick question about revenue for using sites gain. I think the initial guidance assumed 2,400 to 2,700 site gains, has the underlying assumption for this metric change for the current guidance? And how confident are you to achieve this target given that only 233 sites were gained in the first quarter? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: Anthony, no change to the expectations for the full year as it relates to the revenue-producing site gains across manufactured housing and RV for the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. \nJohn Pawlowski: I have 2 questions on the RV business. One, just a clarifying question on the comments made. So is it that the 8% shortfall in reservation pace, is that revenues for the second quarter and third quarter are trending 8% below a year ago? Is that just a number of reservations. Could you just be more specific on that stat? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure, John. The 8% number that I quoted is expected year-over-year decline in revenue growth for the full year. Currently, as it relates to the second quarter, we are expecting about an 8.6% decline in revenue year-over-year. \nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then can you give me some on-the-ground details of what's going on with consumer demand right now? Which regions are you seeing the most pronounced softness? Is it -- or is it a property-type divergence for highly amenitized resorts are suffering? Is it camping? Can you just help me understand what your local teams are seeing, so we have a sense of consumer price sensitivity right now? \nGary Shiffman: John, generally, it's been pretty much across the Board with just a slower pace. So we're guiding a bit based on that year-over-year pacing, if you will. Second quarter has been quiet. We're approaching the seasonal communities that are opening up April, May and a little bit of weather issue impacts us a little bit if it did through the months, but it is mostly just the pacing across the Board. \n So there's no one thing that we can point to, and we don't want to put an expectation of outperformance there. But certainly, we'll see if shorter and closer to normal visitations that the bookings don't pick up a little bit. And -- but for that, we really don't have anything to point to, we'd suggest we asked that question all the time of our management team. There is a return to a lot of other forms of vacation, as we all know, taking place out there across the Board. But we will keep you posted as to any other specific change that we would see. So there's nothing I could point to regionally or within a segment of our communities. \nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Final question from me. Fernando, the $0.14 you're adding back in transaction costs and nonrecurring G&A, it's not too far off from what the cost -- the magnitude of costs added back and in '23 and '22, during much more acquisitive years. And so outside of Royale Life, what else is in this specifically? What else is in this number? And I imagine Royale Life was known at the start of the year. So again, what drove the $0.07 incremental add-back guide versus guide? \nFernando Castro-Caratini: Sure. So it would be the activity that we saw in the first quarter that is largely driving that increase on a guide to guide basis, as we've shared with the market during February, we expected about $9.5 million of add-backs over the course of the year. We did surpass that in the first quarter and are now projecting that just above $18 million related to, as mentioned earlier, primarily these are debt deal costs of transactions that we have been underwriting. And we'll walk away from or have walked away from the transaction costs as detailed earlier as well. \n We do have implementation expenses for our technology platforms that we amortize over a period of time, and it's the amount that we've spent to develop those technologies and implement them. But at this time, that add back for the full year is expected to be $18.4 million as detailed in yesterday's press release. So it would -- that's about $7 million of additional over the course of the rest of the year but that can change. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Chairman, President and CEO, Gary Shiffman for closing remarks. \nGary Shiffman: Thank you, everybody. We just want to end, and letting everyone know we are very, very focused on the concept of understanding, closing the gap in valuation and we are working very, very hard with everything we do to move forward on that, and I look forward to speaking to everybody on the next quarterly call. Thank you, operator. \nOperator: You're welcome. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation. Goodbye.",

            "name": "Gary Shiffman",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on our conference call to discuss first quarter 2024 earnings and our updated guidance. We're pleased to report solid first quarter results underpinned by strong operational performance in each of our businesses. Core FFO per share of $1.19 for the quarter was driven by robust 7.9% year-over-year growth in North American same-property NOI and strong U.K. same-property NOI growth.  \n Our first quarter results underscore how the favorable dynamics of high demand and limited supply, inherent in our best-in-class portfolio generate resilient real property income. Same-property manufactured housing NOI increased 8% compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to several factors, including rental rate increases, occupancy growth and lower expenses. Same-property RV NOI increased 8.1%, primarily reflecting the positive impact of converting transient sites to annual leases, and continued expense savings that partially offset lower transient revenues. Same-property Marina NOI grew 7.5% compared to the prior year.  \n The outperformance was driven by continued strong demand for wet slips and dry storage as well as strong rental rate increases. As we enter our third full year of ownership of our U.K. portfolio, this segment is now included in our same-property reporting. U.K. same-property NOI in the quarter was approximately $11 million, which is a strong start to the year. We remain focused on our capital recycling strategy. And as disclosed on our last earnings call, have sold 2 manufactured housing properties. Currently, we have in the market with additional assets and feel positive about our ability to transact.  \n In terms of capital deployment, Sun continues to be highly selective. Year-to-date, Sun has acquired several bolt-on Marina properties for approximately $12 million that strategically enhance our Marina member network on the East Coast. We recently published our sixth annual ESG report. Key highlights include completing our inventory methodology for reporting scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions and a 73% increase in team member volunteer hours compared to 2022.  \n Additionally, we continue to prioritize our dialogue and interactions with our stakeholders and to work with our supply chain partners to understand their ESG programs. We continue to execute on a plan, focused on delivering earnings growth from a reliable real property income. I would like to thank our talented team members for their continued dedication and strong performance and all our stakeholders for their continued support. \n I will now turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our results and guidance in more detail. Fernando? Thanks for the question, Michael. The U.K. business overall is performing generally in line with expectations. There has been a strategy that -- you mentioned that we've indicated from the time we acquired the acquisition that we look to sacrifice a little bit of the margin on home sales to be able to create a more sticky, dependable real property income in the form of pitch fees there. And it is working very, very well, in first quarter, I think, is a good example of it. \n That being said, there are still economic pressures and headwinds in the U.K. while we're up in volume and overall growth. U.K. very much like what we're seeing in the U.S. is probably not seeing the benefits of interest rate reductions as soon as they might have been anticipated a while ago. So the bottom line is, I think that we'd be in a position to be even excelling further, and we expect to be doing so as we go through the year and into the future. And we'll continue to sacrifice a little bit of that margin to gain the real property revenue. It's been working so far, and we expect it to continue to do so. It's certainly a question we can relate to and understand as we move forward to a very focused plan on taking the underpinning and the incredible performance, if you will, of our business platform and translating it into growth for our shareholders. We're working very, very hard on a number of different areas that we've shared previously, certainly, the simplification, the recycling of capital, and many of the things that we've accomplished over the last couple of quarters. All in an effort, and this includes the continued conversions of transient, where it is harder to forecast out transient RV into annual agreements in our RV communities.  \n All this and the approach that we've taken to looking hard at first quarter and knowing that it's the lowest contributor across the Board first and fourth quarters to our overall FFO performance. We feel comfortable with the adjustments that we made will leave us in the best position to really deliver the results that we're sharing with you today. Well, Josh, we certainly got off to a good start and shared the 2 assets that we did sell. We are currently in the market. And there are a number of opportunities that we feel very good within the selected assets that we offer for dispositions. Again, these are assets that we feel will benefit somebody else in the long run.  \n And there are still buyers out there. There are those that are looking to build platforms and looking past the negative leverage, if you will. But there is definitely a shift in the marketplace with debt costs being higher than they had been for the last long period of time. We look forward to being able to share with everybody the results of these dispositions that we have in the market right now. And hopefully, we'll be able to do that in this coming quarter. Josh, the only thing that I would add to that is the fact that we certainly got through a lot of challenges in '23, have had some headwinds in '24 as we've shared with everybody. But I've also shared a strong desire to be simplifying and assisting with the ability to model. So we continue to do a lot of work on that.  \n And as we go through '24, some of the steps that are taking place, I think, will put us in a cadence be able to provide an understanding and information as we go forward. A good example is U.K. home sales, where we will sacrifice the margin and made a decision and management is actually executing on the decision to increase volume at the cost of a little bit of margin to add to real property income. They've done an outstanding job at Park Holidays. We really want to commend them on that. And it's things like that, that are causing adjustments. But I think as we continue quarter-by-quarter, we'll take a cadence that will feel much better. Brad, are we talking about the U.K.? Again, I'd kind of reiterate what Fernando said in the fact that even going back to when we announced the acquisition, we had a strategy recognizing that the model in the U.K. is different than it is in the U.S. And we would sacrifice margin for increase in occupancy and gaining that more sticky dependable, if you will, and modelable is such a word, FFO on the real property side. So what you're seeing is a continuation on that.  \n We -- in '23, definitely hit headwinds of a slowing economy that caused that to accelerate faster than our 5- or 7-year plan originally had it. But I would say right now, where we're at, we're right on target where we want them to be, with Park Holidays. And I think you'll just continue to see us hit guidance and if things should improve or if we have an opportunity to make more rapid, we would definitely share that in the future. Wes, we continue to believe in the long-term strength of the overall RV sector. And as you know, we've been strategically reducing our transient exposure and relative contribution over the past few years in favor of the stability of the growth of the annual agreements that we're really, really focused on.  \n So we've increased the annuals by about 27% by converting the transient since 2020. And our expectation and our outlook moving forward, if you'll continue to see that. And again, that allows us to budget and forecast with a higher degree of confidence as we have those homes in on an annual basis, and they're not subject to the concerns of whether, again, much of the transient is within a 3-hour drive of the home base of our guests. And so weather conditions as we saw in April. And as we've seen more recently in the last couple of years, do impact that short-term transient guest stability to be able to forecast it.  \n So I think that while it's a good business, and we will continue to have a percentage of it, we will continue to focus on converting those transient over to annuals. And we're seeing stronger and stronger demand, and we're opening up more and more of our transient sites and will allow them to be converted to annual. Yes. I would just suggest, as Fernando mentioned, certainly, pace has a lot to do with it. We're seeing it 8% down year-over-year. There is concept that says the shorting booking windows will yield the potential for upside, but in our efforts to give the best guidance that we can going forward. We're looking at outpacing is right now. \n I don't know if Fernando of you have anything to add. I'll answer the first part, and Fernando can talk about guiding forward. But the strategy of shifting margin for occupancy gain has been our strategy all along. As I indicated before, it more rapidly accelerated in 2023 as we brought margins down due to the headwinds of the economy. \n But what you're seeing right now is continued strong demand for the Park Holidays community and a management team that from day 1, understood the concept of being able to increase occupancy and increase real property contribution over the concept of the onetime sales margin that probably worked much better for them as the portfolio was owned by private equity firms in the past. So it's pretty much it exactly where we want it to be now, and we're hoping to continue it and really make a difference in how we're going to look long term at the value creation, if you will, of the real property contribution. Yes. I think we've talked about being very, very strategic in our thinking with use of capital. And we've also shared the plan that we're looking to both recycle capital and dispositions as well as through cash flow by shutting down development and using that cap will pay down more costly debt on a rate basis. \n I think that when you have 500 to 600 properties that are very, very strategically located and the strategic piece of land or opportunity comes about, we take advantage of that, thinking about the long-term nature of Sun. And all you're seeing there is, as you saw in the Marinas. There are just some bolt-on opportunities where we have a very, very low cost, a great deal of potential value creation in the future, and those are just one-off strategic opportunities, small in nature. Yes. On the U.S. home side, Keegan, really given the high occupancy of which our MH properties operate and our strategic shift away from deploying capital into that development and expansion. We did guide towards much lower home sales this particular year. And that is something I think that just demonstrates a little bit of the strength that we're seeing at nearly a 98% occupancy in the MH and annual communities. I think answering the second part of your question. First, we talked about reducing transient from high 20,000s to about 14,000, 15,000 over a 3-, 4-, 5-year period of time, transient sites to be our best in transient properties as well as the feeder to continue to feed annual RV guests as they move out. So we're making good, good progress there. And with regard to other opportunities, I think on the social media side, on the marketing side, we've been very, very focused. \n I think that there's been a lot of talk about the incredible growth through COVID and the return to pre-COVID periods of time. We're really just focused, if you will, growing from where we are and we have engaged a number of third parties who have hospitality experience, looking at different forms of revenue management, different forms of looking for business activity, in the shoulder parts of the week, in the shoulder seasons. \n So we're very, very focused. And I do believe that there is opportunity than near to long term to really enhance the transient pool of properties and sites that we have, we're also what is left in the portfolio becomes the best of the transient. So there's an opportunity as well as we continue to convert to see longer to midterm kind of improvements in growth than we're seeing right now. But there's no -- nothing specific that I could point to that would tell you that it's leading directly to an anticipated change. Sure. I think I'd share and really reiterate the thoughts related specifically to that, which the goal to create simplification up and down throughout the company. The company has grown a lot, complexities certainly crept in. And as we've discussed previously, we're really making good progress along those lines with regard to the Board, we're pleased with the addition of the new board members. We're pleased with the setup of the committees going forward. We're doing well through our disposition program and recycling that capital. \n We've talked about one of the JVs that we've been able to simplify greatly that we shared the Northgate properties last quarter. We've talked about stepping out of the headstock in Australia, and we've sold off our interest in the proprietary software for managing our RV communities, although we still use it, great software Campspot. And at the same time, the conversions that are taking place that we've spent a lot of time talking about today and other days, allow us to manage our business much better to bring the cost margins, are greater in the annual properties than they are in the transient properties, which will translate to future growth as well. \n I think that the strategy that is working well in the U.K. right now with regard to moving more of the volatile home sales margin into real property income. The fact that we've been able to get through the foreclosure process on the assets in the U.K. and have Park Holidays manage them. In particular, the great job they're doing at Sandy Bay. We're excited to share the results of how things are shaping up over there. So these are all the things that the Board and the managed team are -- management team are focused on. It also gives me the opportunity to mention that we have Aaron Weiss sitting in on our call today, we brought in 2 years ago. \n So as an effort to broaden our executive team and our bench. I think that we're really excited to be able to demonstrate how the simplification and approach to everything is going to translate into FFO growth as Sun has been known for it historically. But of course, we realize that we have a ways to go to demonstrate it through 2024, gain some of that lost credibility back. And we're working very, very hard and very, very diligently to do so. And I think it's just underpinned by the really outstanding performance of the business platform, and we continue to work hard and share more of that information quarter-by-quarter with you. Well, I'm going to suggest what we talked about at NAREIT and some of the conferences in our calls that 2024 isn't without its headwinds. We talked a lot about the specific financial headwinds and the simplification paths that were taking place. Our real goal is to look at 2025 when most of these headwinds that we can identify are behind us, and we can really, really begin to translate the very strong core business growth into -- growth to our shareholders. So while there is upside and there is a risk to everything as we go through the year, we all know it's still a challenged economy with a lot of uncertainty in there. As far as what we can control in the company, we feel like we'll be in a very, very good position, finishing out '24 and going into '25. John, generally, it's been pretty much across the Board with just a slower pace. So we're guiding a bit based on that year-over-year pacing, if you will. Second quarter has been quiet. We're approaching the seasonal communities that are opening up April, May and a little bit of weather issue impacts us a little bit if it did through the months, but it is mostly just the pacing across the Board. \n So there's no one thing that we can point to, and we don't want to put an expectation of outperformance there. But certainly, we'll see if shorter and closer to normal visitations that the bookings don't pick up a little bit. And -- but for that, we really don't have anything to point to, we'd suggest we asked that question all the time of our management team. There is a return to a lot of other forms of vacation, as we all know, taking place out there across the Board. But we will keep you posted as to any other specific change that we would see. So there's nothing I could point to regionally or within a segment of our communities. Thank you, everybody. We just want to end, and letting everyone know we are very, very focused on the concept of understanding, closing the gap in valuation and we are working very, very hard with everything we do to move forward on that, and I look forward to speaking to everybody on the next quarterly call. Thank you, operator."

            "content": "Thank you, Gary. In the first quarter, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share of $1.19, driven by strong real property revenue growth and our continued focus on managing expenses. In North America, total same-property NOI for the quarter grew 7.9%, driven by a 6% increase in revenues and a 2.2% increase in expenses, further detailing each segment.  \n Same-property manufactured housing reported another solid quarter with an 8% increase in NOI compared to 2023. The NOI was driven by a 6.8% increase in revenue and expense growth of 3.4%. For same-property RV, its 8.1% NOI growth was driven by a 3.1% increase in revenue and a 1.8% decrease in expenses. The year-over-year decline in RV operating expenses was due to aligning controllable costs with transient revenues, notably in payroll and utilities. Occupancy for same-property manufactured housing and RV, adjusted to include expansion activity, increased 180 basis points year-over-year to 98.9%. Part of the uplift in occupancy can be attributed to conversions of transient to annual RV sites. \n For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2024, Sun converted over 1,750 transient sites to annual contracts accounting for approximately 65% of our revenue-producing site gains. We are continuing our strategic focus on converting transient to annual sites. Since the start of 2020, we have completed nearly 7,100 conversions and have increased the number of annual sites by approximately 27%. Marina's posted another strong quarter with same property NOI increasing 7.5% compared to 2023. This was driven mainly by rate increases for wet slips and dry storage spaces across the portfolio and stronger transient demand, resulting in a 7.1% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 6.5% increase in expenses, primarily driven by payroll.  \n In the U.K. same property NOI increased by $3.3 million, representing a 44.5% increase over 2023 same-property results, higher rental rates increased customer retention and the early timing of the Easter holiday break drove a 12.3% increase in revenue in the quarter. Property operating expenses decreased 1.7% year-over-year primarily reflecting timing differences for supply and repair and payroll costs. \n First quarter U.K. home sales volumes were in line with expectations. We sold more than 620 homes representing a 5.4% increase compared to the previous year. FFO contribution was $10.2 million for the quarter, reflecting the strong sales volume, offset in part by lower margins. The strong unit sales performance in the first quarter will lead to an increase in community occupancy and site rent for the year. This aligns with our strategic objective to shift a larger share of our U.K. business activity from home sales to real property rents. Regarding capital allocation, Sun remains extremely disciplined, pursuing limited strategic opportunities. As Gary indicated, we recycled approximately $52 million of proceeds from selling 2 assets this year and acquired 4 highly strategic Marinas for approximately $12 million. \n Turning to our balance sheet. On March 31, 2024, the company had approximately $7.8 billion in net debt outstanding and our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio was 6.1x. We remain focused on further enhancing our balance sheet strength. During the quarter, Sun issued $500 million of 5-year senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 5.5%. Net proceeds were used to pay down borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility. \n During the quarter, we also paid off our corporate term loan with our revolving credit facility. Our weighted average debt maturity is 6.8 years, and our variable rate debt was approximately 11% at the end of the quarter. We intend to use free cash flow from operations and proceeds from planned asset sales to reduce overall leverage and variable rate debt percentages. As detailed in yesterday's release, we are updating our 2024 guidance for first quarter results as follows: we narrowed our full year core FFO per share guidance to a range of $7.06 to $7.22. \n We are also establishing guidance for the second quarter of 2024 core FFO per share in the range of $1.83 to $1.91. For our total portfolio, we expect real property NOI growth in the range of 6.5% to 7.3%. Higher expected NOI growth in MH and Marinas should offset lower expected NOI from RV. In North America, the updated full year same property growth range is 4.6% to 5.8%. The 40 basis point reduction at the midpoint is primarily due to transient RV revenue headwinds. \n Revised expectations are 6.2% to 7.1% for manufactured housing, a 15 basis point increase at the midpoint, negative 0.3% to 1.3% for RVs, a 230 basis point decrease at the midpoint driven by transient RV revenue headwinds, which we are partially offsetting with controllable expense reductions, and 6.4% to 7.6% for Marinas, a 20 basis point increase at the midpoint.  \n In the U.K., we forecast approximately the same total FFO contribution for the year, but with a greater contribution now expected to come from real property results. We are increasing our full year same property NOI forecast from the prior range of 1.3% to 3.3% to a new range of 6% to 8%. The increase is driven by greater expected rental revenues complemented by continued cost management efforts. The higher real property revenue outlook is a function of the previously implemented rental rate increases and higher home sales volume and retention achieved year-to-date.  \n For U.K. home sales, we maintain our range of expected volume for the year, but expect lower FFO contribution due to lower margins. Our U.K. strategy remains focused on shifting a larger proportion of our income from home sales margins into the resilient, reliable NOI generated by real property rents. Overall, we are pleased with our operating performance, expense management, and minimizing capital spending over the course of this year. Please refer to our supplemental for additional guidance information.  \n As a reminder, our guidance includes acquisitions and dispositions and capital markets activity through April 29, but it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may be included in research analyst estimates. \n This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator? And Michael, while they're certainly are moving pieces to the guidance, we did reiterate our FFO guidance per share with the second quarter. John, the G&A move upward from guide to guide. That's from a GAAP perspective. So that does not include some add backs that we have for FFO, mainly deal costs and transaction costs, of which there were just over $11 million in the quarter. The transaction expenses related to finalizing the receivership process related to the Royale Life note and investor engagement during the first quarter. So while there is -- on the guidance page, there is an increase from guide to guide in G&A. Our net of those add-backs, we are still expecting at the midpoint our G&A to grow by about 4.6%, again at the midpoint. And John, you're seeing the uplift of that occupancy gain on the annual side with just over 13% growth for that line item in the first quarter. The movement or the guide downward on the RV side is primarily due to the transient headwinds as mentioned earlier, where we will look to offset as much of it as possible by -- with controllable expense cost reductions.  \n The -- our forecast set in February for our guidance implied a 2.6% reduction in transient revenue for the year. That is -- that was including the impact of conversions, as mentioned, that is currently with all the information that we have in front of us as it relates to pace, shorter booking windows, that is currently expected to be about 8% reduction for the year. So that is the largest mover on the RV side. Overall, when you take that into consideration with our Manufactured Housing platform and Marina platform, the guide downward on the NOI side is about $4 million. We're looking to provide as much disclosure as possible to the market as it relates to all of the -- all of our business platforms and other line items. So you can -- with the guidance, you can track almost entirely P&L. We did add guidance in February as it related to expected interest expense which had not been provided previously. So that is that's looking to provide as much color as possible to the market as it relates to our expectations, those expectations, some shift upwards, some shift downwards as you're seeing with the guidance provided last night. But it's the best information that we have in front of us today to provide to you and the rest of the market. The guidance fully reflects the underlying change -- or not a change in strategy, but the continuation of that strategy of shifting more right, more income into the reliable real property side. And then, Wes, on aggregate, the total FFO contribution from Park Holidays for 2024 is in line with original expectations. Park Holidays contribution to core FFO also includes SRD&E through retail and F&B operations and head office personnel and corporate activities on the G&A side. in the first quarter and for the year included in the overall contribution to core FFO was an expected payroll tax withholding that refund and third-party costs related to securing this refund.  \n These various items had a net impact of about $2 million to our aggregate $153 million of core FFO in the first quarter or much larger for the rest of the year. These changes are similar and consistent with, call it, it's akin to real estate tax or sales tax or other expense changes that are periodically, reflected, updated treatment of revenue or expense. These changes are sometimes favorable or unfavorable to the current period. Yes. It was on same property is and that is detailed during the call, is primarily driven by the higher rental rates, higher retention than expected and we did see a stronger Easter break, which also the comp on a year-over-year basis where Easter was during the second quarter in 2023. Keegan, on the U.K. side, that's a mix of both of pricing and mix shifting more towards the pre-owned side of sales. Sandy Bay is ramping up well as it relates to marketing efforts for sales heading into a busier season over the course of the next couple of months. Eric has detailed a little bit earlier in the quarter and budgeted this way contribution in the U.K. included a VAT refund on the real property side. It included additional expenses or higher expenses given payroll tax withholding and costs associated with securing that refund. The net of those figures is about $2 million for the quarter or for the year. \n But consistent with this is akin to say real estate tax assessments, right, where we may pay a little bit more, given the assessment that we get from the state. And if there's -- if we are able to work through that assessment, we might be at a refund in a later period. It's similar and consistent with that practice. Thank you, Eric. The spend on the recurring CapEx side is consistent, and we do have higher CapEx -- recurring CapEx on the Marina side and on the U.K. side during the first quarter of the year. So that spend is expected to moderate over the rest of the year as it relates to total nonrecurring CapEx for the quarter, it does represent about a 45% reduction as compared to the first quarter of last year. And is expected to ramp up as we've discussed with the market, our spend on CapEx is expected to be somewhere around 55% reduction to the figures that you saw spend in 2023. Sure, Jamie. As we've stated previously, our long-term leverage targets are to be at 5.5x and below. Today, we are at 6.1x from a leverage perspective. Growth in EBITDA over the course of the year should provide deleveraging by the end of the year as well, as Gary had stated before, we have multiple opportunities from a capital recycling standpoint that we trust we'll update the market with over the course of the next couple of months and quarters that should also contribute towards reaching and surpassing that goal of 5.5x. Floating rate debt today as of the end of the quarter was just above 11%, we will look to manage that percentage to be below 10%. So that's something that we can do here over the course of the short term. That takes us into 2025 from that standpoint. Anthony, our -- we have brought margin expectations down for the year by about $2,600, that is helping drive more preowned lodge sales that premiumization or those upgrade sales is something that we will continue to work with our customers that have bought a preowned home over the course of the last couple of years and are looking to upgrade. So that is part of the strategy as it relates to that higher retention that we've been discussing as it relates to our homeowners across the portfolio. It's going to depend, Anthony, on the size of that home and that site and where that site is in the portfolio. But yes, there is usually a premiumization, not just from the sale of the home, but also on the pitch fee side. Anthony, no change to the expectations for the full year as it relates to the revenue-producing site gains across manufactured housing and RV for the year. Sure, John. The 8% number that I quoted is expected year-over-year decline in revenue growth for the full year. Currently, as it relates to the second quarter, we are expecting about an 8.6% decline in revenue year-over-year. Sure. So it would be the activity that we saw in the first quarter that is largely driving that increase on a guide to guide basis, as we've shared with the market during February, we expected about $9.5 million of add-backs over the course of the year. We did surpass that in the first quarter and are now projecting that just above $18 million related to, as mentioned earlier, primarily these are debt deal costs of transactions that we have been underwriting. And we'll walk away from or have walked away from the transaction costs as detailed earlier as well. \n We do have implementation expenses for our technology platforms that we amortize over a period of time, and it's the amount that we've spent to develop those technologies and implement them. But at this time, that add back for the full year is expected to be $18.4 million as detailed in yesterday's press release. So it would -- that's about $7 million of additional over the course of the rest of the year but that can change."
