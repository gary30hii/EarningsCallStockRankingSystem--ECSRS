At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Mr. Matt Carrus.\nMatthew Carrus: Thank you, [Dillaman], and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the Company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh?\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. In the suite of this year-end call, I would like to review year 2020, the most challenging in our history and discuss different paths of growth, long-term value creation for our continuing shareholders on par share basis. We came into 2020 prepared for perhaps a plain-vanilla business cycle downturn. We pushed out our maturities in Q4 of 2019, sold a lot of short duration assets, bought a lot of longer duration assets, and continued to upgrade our portfolio, operators, management contract, and talent. We are hopeful that with the continued decline in senior housing deliveries and starts on one hand and the ageing of the population finally picking up on the other hand that 2020 would serve an inflection point for the fundamentals after decades of weak demographics resulting from the ageing of the baby-boomer generation. Then, the once-a-century pandemic happened that would turn out to be particularly devastating for our business. The back half of first quarter, the second and third quarters were all about long-term value preservation. We enhanced our liquidity profile dramatically by selling assets in record time at or near pre-COVID pricing, more importantly avoided mistakes of raising long-term dilutive capital, a consistent theme for managing the company for continuing shareholder on a par share basis. We started during the dark days of March and April by selling $1 billion of assets at great prices in record 43 days from signing a confidentiality agreement to receiving cash. We continued this journey during Q2 and Q3 and eventually executed on $3.7 billion of disposition at extraordinary prices to build an unprecedented war chest. Two things particularly surprised me during these times. The resilience of our team including our extended team of operating partners and the liquidity of our assets. Not that we didn't have doubts or failures, but we continued to move forward in spite of them with a steady hand on the wheel and an unwavering belief that we\u2019ll get to the other side. Our team\u2019s stoic resilience reminded me every day of Winston Churchill's famous quote, that \u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not final, it is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d In those moments of reckoning, I realized how privileged I was to be part of this team that didn't miss a beat and blazed new trail. For years, I have heard that healthcare-oriented real estate deserves a discount for the \u2013 to say, a shiny tower in middle of a large gateway city due to the lack of liquidity and smaller ticket size, especially during down cycles. I hope that during the worst down cycle of our asset class, this debate has been finally settled as demonstrated by our execution and that of our colleagues that helped [indiscernible]. In the fall, we pivoted again from defense to offense as we started underwriting and shaking hands on new acquisitions. It is important for you to understand that we don't shake hands and find excuses to walk or chip away, which if we shake hands, we close. Our handshake in this business is worth gold, and we only enhanced our long-term reputation during this pandemic. During last quarter\u2019s call, I discussed $1 billion of deep value opportunity. I am delighted to report that we have closed roughly $700 million of acquisitions since the start of fourth quarter at a significant discount to replacement cost. Our acquisition pipeline has grown meaningfully, and as I sit here today, I am optimistic this year is shaping up to be a year of net acquisition, perhaps significantly so. At the same time, I will remind you that we are not driven and incentivized by volume of acquisition, but the value of it. Asset price is the ultimate determinant of how we'll behave. In this moment of confusion and ambiguity, I indulge you to focus on four distinct pillars of long-term value creation for Welltower. One, operating fundamentals. Tim will get into the details of what happened last quarter and what might happen next quarter. While operating fundamentals is awful right now with little near-term visibility, we are optimistic about the vaccine rollout as 90% of our assisted living and memory care facilities have conducted their first vaccination clinic with virtually all residents taking the shot. While I would not expect this to be a source of value creation in the very near term, I'm hopeful about the second half of the year. Normalization of operating performance remains the largest source of value creation for our shareholders. It is too early to comment on exact timing of the trough and the shape of the recovery, but we'll keep you posted frequently intra-quarter so that you can see what we see. Our focus remains on upholding the reputation of our communities and maintaining the safety of our operator staff and residents. We spared no expenses and have already spent in excess of $80 million on COVID-related expenses to-date doing everything we can within our control to support their wellbeing. Due to the great reputation of our operators and the extraordinary value they provide, rates are holding up. In 2020, REVPOR was up 2% in AL memory care, 1% in independent living, and 4.4% in our seniors\u2019 apartment business. This growth occurred despite the headwinds resulting from lower community fees driven by a decline in move-in activity. Number two, operator platform enhancement, management contracts, leadership and system enhancements, and building local scale are some of the examples of this. Let me highlight two specifics here. A) Sunrise, we are delighted by the appointment of Jack Callison as the CEO of Sunrise Living, our largest operating partner. Jack will bring much needed attention to operating excellence with an operations-first culture. We are also negotiating a new management contract that will align the interest of Sunrise and Welltower as the owner of the assets. We are diligently working with the management of Revera, Sunrise's majority owner to enhance Sunrise's position so that it can emerge from this pandemic as the leading operator of poised for excellence and growth. B) Building local scale. If I can quote Charlie Munger, the advantage of local scale are of ungodly [ph] importance to this business. We have and we will continue to scale our most important strategic partners as we expand our senior housing footprint. To name a few in alphabetical order, Balfour, Brandywine, Clover, Cojir, Frontier, Kelsey-Seybold, Kisco, Oakmont, StoryPoint are just some of the examples of the partners we have grown significantly during this pandemic. What is common amongst them? They are excellent operators in their market. They have great leadership. They are disciplined. Yes, courageous, and they have an aligned relationship with Welltower. We rise and fall together. This list is expanding with our significant opportunity set that I mentioned few moments ago. Number three, capital deployment opportunity. I have already commented on the acquisition opportunity on the deep value side. As a risk of sounding like a broken record, I would remind you that we are an IRR buyer with an incredible focus on basis, operators and structure. Our opportunity set is rising rapidly and I hope to provide you with more specific color in next 60 to 90 days. This comment is obviously focused on the current opportunities. Let me provide you with some color on a related topic, but on future opportunities. We at Welltower, has never been in a more advantageous position as a partner of choice. For years, we have focused on growth strategy driven by our relationship-based and alignment-focused structures and data analytics platform rather than prioritize on costs and access to capital advantage. After all, not all capital is equal. We never imagined that we've encountered today's extreme stress, but as you can see, we stood by our operators during this difficult time not only to preserve their businesses, but also to grow it significantly. Talk is cheap, but action is not. For this reason, we are inundated with requests as a partner of choice from all asset classes we play in. As much as they like do call, we have been on roads throughout this pandemic meeting with prospective partners. This is very meaningful truths. We have executed more partnership and pipeline deals in next nine months then over five proceeding years combined. We expect to deploy $10-plus billion of capital in these opportunities in next few years. In other words, we are not only executing on deep value early cycle opportunities, but also laying a strong foundation of growth through the entire cycle when inevitably the significant price discrepancies of today will be gone. To give you an example, we recently reupped our master development agreement for five years with Kelsey-Seybold, our largest MOB tenant. We are looking to start approximately 600,000 square feet, 100% pre-leased development in 2021 and 2022. Number four, talent opportunity. I touched on this last call, but let me elaborate for those of you who are focused on long-term. We are seeing an incredible interest in our platform from seasoned professionals to early career applicants. We have taken advantage of recent disruption and brought in 41 new professionals in 2020. We expect at least as many, if not more to join our team in 2021. In addition to new talent, our existing talent pool is taking on more responsibilities in reaching new heights. As a result, we had 50 new promotions at Welltower. Though this puts out early pressure on G&A, which is partially offset by lower executive comp, we think this incredible talent pool is equivalent of a cold spring, which will manifest itself in a meaningful growth for the farm. Speaking of talent pool, how is the mood inside today inside Welltower. What I described to you as a stoic resilience last year has transformed into an environment of optimism and unbridled passion this year. I want to make it abundantly clear. We have no crystal ball about the near-term operating fundamentals, but we are doing meaningful work that matters we have meaningful relationship and we are seeing a new level of positive energy of people who wants to be part of this team internally and externally to create meaningful value and make a disproportionate impact. With that, I'll pass it over the microphone to Tim. Tim?\nTimothy McHugh: Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2020 results, the performance of all of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update and our first quarter outlook. The fourth quarter was a tough end to a very challenging year as the ongoing impact that coronavirus accelerated meaningfully in the back half of the fourth quarter and into the beginning of 2021. The visibility for large parts of our business beyond the next 90 days remain very limited and very dependent on virus-related variables, such as its unpredictable path of growth, the rollout and efficacy of the vaccine and the continuation of population lockdown mandates. As a result of this uncertainty, we decided to provide our first quarter outlook this morning in place of the full-year outlook we would normally provide in our fourth quarter call. As we have done over the last year, we will continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis, with the intention of providing a more complete outlook, as soon as the variants of the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for liable forecasting. Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $0.39 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.84 per diluted share. Normalized FFO was sequentially flat in third quarter and the decline in senior housing operating earnings and dilution from disposition to close over the last two quarters was offset by recognition of HHS funds, lower G&A, lower interest expense, and initial returns on reinvested capital. Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, with our Triple-Net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflected trailing 12 months ending 9/30/2020, and therefore, only reflect a partial impact from COVID-19. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the fourth quarter, having collected 97% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period. Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio. Same-store NOI declined 2.7% year-over-year as leases that were moved to cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against prior full-year contractual rent received. Occupancy was down 260 basis points sequentially consistent with the average occupancy drop from 2Q to 3Q in our RIDEA portfolio and EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01x on a sequential basis in this portfolio to 1.01x. During the quarter, we transitioned a UK development portfolio from triple-net to RIDEA, transitioned 14 former triple-net capital senior assets to new operators in RIDEA structures and disposed of one asset to the net impact of increasing coverage by 0.03x. Consistent with my comments in the past, our senior housing triple-net lease operators experienced similar headwinds as our RIDEA operators over the past nine months and we expect reported lease coverage stats to continue to reflect these challenges as more of the pandemic periods reflected in EBITDAR going forward. That being said, resilience of this portfolio is reflected by the continued high cash collection rate is encouraging. As I described last quarter, we entered into agreement with Capital Senior at beginning of 2020, which allowed for an early termination of CSU leases on 24 Welltower owned assets in exchange for full rent being paid in 2020 in cooperation with transitioning the operations of these assets. We transitioned 14 properties operated by CSU to new operators in the fourth quarter in addition to the five that were transitioned during the third quarter and anticipate the remaining assets to be transitioned to new operators in the first half of 2021. As a result of the continued COVID backdrop, the initial expected dilution from these conversions is expected to be approximately $0.04 per share in 2021. Additionally, the conversion of a development portfolio in the UK from triple-net to RIDEA is also expected to be negatively impact normalized FFO by $0.04 per share in 2021. The combination of these two transitions is expected to result in a sequential roll down with a little over $0.02 per share of normalized FFO from Q4 to Q1. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated 2% year-over-year same-store growth. However, EBITDAR coverage declined by 0.012x sequentially to 1.0x, which was almost entirely due to deterioration in largest long-term post-acute tenant Genesis HealthCare. As we noted last quarter, Genesis HealthCare, which makes up approximately half of our long-term post-acute exposure raise concerns around its ability to continue as a going concern in the second quarter financials filed on August 10. As a result of this concern, Welltower began recording revenue on a cash basis in the third quarter. Furthermore, we wrote down our unsecured loan exposure driven by $80 million in the fourth quarter. Similar to our Genesis lease income, we've been recognizing all interest on our unsecured loans on a cash basis. So this impairment does not change income recognition on these loans. Genesis remains current on all financial obligations to Welltower through January. And lastly, health systems, which comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 2.27x. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical office portfolio delivered positive 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth modestly below long-term trends. Growth continues to be negatively impacted by reserves for uncollected rent, the large majority of which resulting from lease enforcement moratoriums in several California jurisdictions in which we have a sizable footprint as I described last quarter. As these moratoriums expire, we expect rent collection to improve from 98.5% received in the fourth quarter. Looking back at 2020, our outpatient medical platform displayed incredible resilience in a truly challenging year, which includes periods of time, which basic medical appointments and procedures were flat out, not permitted. We still managed to grow same-store NOI in an average of positive 1.7%. During the fourth quarter, we continued to observe improvements in several key operating trends as business continue to normalize, notably a pickup in our leasing pipeline, which has start to reflect positive occupancy pickup towards the back half of 2021. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter\u2019s result, I want to point out that we received approximately $9 million from the Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act Provider Relief Fund and post-quarter we received another $34 million, delivering $8 million and $31 million of net expected proceeds at our share. We are recognizing these funds on a cash basis and so there were flow through financials at quarter in which they are received. We are normalizing these HHS funds on a same-store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received that are not matched to expenses incurred in the period they received. In the fourth quarter, there are approximately $11.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied with HHS program in the U.S. Now turning to results in the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 33.8% as compared to fourth quarter of 2019 and decreased 11.3% sequentially from the third quarter. Starting with revenue, sequential same-store revenue was down 2.4% in Q4 driven primarily by 160 basis point drop in average occupancy. As a reminder, we started the fourth quarter with relative optimism on the occupancy front with improving year-over-year moving volumes and relatively low prevalence of COVID within our communities. However, these positive trends rapidly reverse as the exponential rise in global COVID cases in November and December, but the city and statewide lockdowns, admissions bans across many of our key MSAs particularly in the UK and California, which together comprised 34% of our SHO Portfolio NOI. Result of this was 180 basis points of occupancy loss from November through year-end. As I stated on our third quarter call, the path of COVID will dictate our business trend from the fourth quarter, not seasonality and not the seasonal flu, and that has proved quite true over the past 3.5 months. Turning to REVPOR in the quarter, total SHO Portfolio REVPOR was down 1.2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. But as I described last quarter, mix shift is restored in the true picture of rent growth metrics. The standalone year-over-year REVPOR growth for active adult, independent living and assisted living segments were positive 3.7%, 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively. The combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by considerable changes in composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio, as lower acuity properties, independent living and senior departments have held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID. We just had the mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity and therefore, lower rent paying units. The point being rental rates are proving more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics. And lastly, expenses, total same-store expenses declined 2.1% year-over-year and increased 50 basis points, sequentially. I'll focus on the sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 50 basis point increase in operating costs was driven mainly by higher sequential COVID costs as a result of the surge in cases in the fourth quarter. Decline in topline combined with these expense pressures had a meaningful impact on our operating margins, which declined 220 basis points sequentially to 22.3%. As I noted earlier in the call, we did not include government reimbursement that was not tied to period expenses \u2013 NPL expenses in our same-store results, and therefore, COVID expenses negatively impact same-store by $18.9 million in the quarter. We will stay consistent with distribution in Q1, where we've already received a net $31 million in HHS funds that would likely turn COVID expenses into a net benefit if included in our same-stores and offset. Looking forward to the first quarter and starting with 2021 year-to-date data we have already observed. We've experienced 180 basis point decline in occupancy through February 5. Given the still heightened presence of COVID, we expect average occupancy to be down 275 to 375 basis points from fourth quarter to first quarter. Note that we are providing the average occupancy as opposed to spot occupancy as a former better tie to our reported financials, and therefore, 260 basis points of our expected 275 to 375 basis point decline is already baked given the swift drop from mid-November to-date in occupancy. We expect monthly REVPOR to be down 20 basis points sequentially, although it should be noted that actual rent per unit is up 2.1% sequentially. With mix shift, which I mentioned earlier, and two fewer days in the quarter is Q1 reported REVPOR versus actual rent growth. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat as higher sequential COVID costs are offset by less labor utilization due to lower occupancy levels. Turning to capital markets activity. Throughout 2020, we took a series of actions that were difficult result in our ability to retain significant cash flow and ultimately gave us greater control to navigate through the pandemic. It's worth highlighting that despite the stress driven by our business, we've avoided the destabilization of the balance sheet by borrowing to pay the dividend or being forced in raising equity or selling assets on attractive valuations. Given where we sit today, the $2.1 billion of cash in over $5.1 billion of available liquidity, we are pleased with our course of actions being the most prudent way to maximize balance sheets stability and positioning us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities. In addition to showing up a balance sheet, we undertook a series of actions to optimize spend and maximize retaining cash flow by reducing our corporate overhead through tighter cost controls and fine tuning of capital expenditure plans. We also made the decision in May to reduce our quarterly dividend by 30%, given the uncertainties from the pandemic timeline and severity. Despite the pandemic substantial negative impact on our business, our actions throughout 2020 removed any dependence on a quick recovery, and also afforded us the opportunity to be patient with respect to the transaction market and take advantage of attractive private market valuations relative to public markets, while also highlighting institutional demand for a high quality portfolio. Over the course of the year, we sold $3.7 billion of pro rata assets at a blended 5.4% yield, including $1.3 billion of senior housing operating assets at a price per unit of 332,000 per PPE. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we sold a portfolio of senior housing operating properties operated by Northbridge for $200 million, representing a 4.9% cap rate on March trailing 12-month NOI and $395,000 per unit. Also in the fourth quarter, we announced a new joint venture partnership with certain investment vehicles managed by Wafra. The joint venture comprised a portfolio of 24 outpatient medical properties previously majority owned by Welltower. Many of these transactions were completed in the midst of significant disruption to real estate and capital markets, when the long-term viability of our senior housing assets in particular were being called into question. While we are pleased with execution on disposition front, we\u2019re excited to now be executing on the acquisition side with financial flexibility and ample liquidity. On our third quarter earnings call, Shankh described $1 billion acquisition pipeline. And since the start of the fourth quarter, we've closed on $657 million at a blended initial yield of 4.5% with an expected stabilized yield over 7.5%. Lastly, moving to our first quarter outlook. Last time we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.24 to $0.29 and normalized per diluted share of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. The midpoint of our guidance $0.735 per share represents a sequential decline of approximately $0.105 per share from the fourth quarter. The $0.105 decline is composed of a $0.08 decline in senior housing operating results driven by $0.06 of fundamental decline and $0.02 of increased COVID cost. A $0.03 per share sequential decline in triple-net senior housing NOI, a little over $0.02 of which is related to the Capital Senior and signature UK transitions mentioned earlier with the remainder due to fundamental declines on cash recognition leases. A $0.02 per share decline related to net investment activity in Q4 and Q1 and $0.03 related to a combination of other items mainly made up of increased G&A, income tax and a slight decline in interest income. These declines are offset by a 5.5% increase in pro rata HHS funds received to date in the first quarter. As a reminder, we are only guiding the HHS funds that have already been received as of today's call. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. I want to end with two things before we open it up for questions. First, I'm excited about the collaboration that is the March between our peers and us. We have worked diligently with healthy Ventas and Omega to address operator and industry issues and towards mutually beneficial transactions. For example, it was an absolute pleasure to work with Tom DeRosa and his team on two separate transactions, totaling $170 million. I'm positive we are embarking on a new era of collaboration amongst the public companies in our space. Second, in spite of our talent is being faced by our industry today, our confidence in our business has not changed, and I'm hopeful that my comments this morning have provided you with a framework for how we intend to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. We are grateful to be part of your portfolio as our shareholders. Personally, this management team has established a highly concentrated position in Welltower. In fact, neither Tim nor I have sold a single share of the stock that we have received on a post-tax basis since we have come on board few years ago, which should be an indication to you our fellow shareholders of our conviction and personal stake we have in this business. As Buffet taught us, diversification may preserve wealth, but concentration builds wealth. This does not mean the path forward will be without challenges, but it is clear that we are all in on this company and that our alignment with you, our shareholder is strong and significant. With that, we'll open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning and thank you for the time. Just on the acquisition front, you guys talked about the $1 billion pipeline and being confident on more opportunities. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on what the focus is. Is it still on the kind of the value opportunities in seniors housing buying at a great basis? And if that's the case or more generally, if you can give color on the timeline to stabilization from the low cap rates going in, what we should expect in terms of when you get those stabilized yields?\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Juan. Good morning. That is, our focus is to buy near-term \u2013 at least in the near-term basis value opportunities that are significant discount replacement costs where we can bring in the right operators or buy with the right operators if it is owned by some other capital partners of our operators. So we're focused on basis, we\u2019re focused on operator, we\u2019re focused on structure. Interestingly, we're starting to see some opportunities where the initial yield is not as much of a drag. That\u2019s just a coincidence. We're not focused on that. We're focused very much on basis, structure, and operators. And I expect that our blended yield of the opportunities when we talk about next quarter will actually be dragged up overall by this set of opportunities. But I can tell you that is not our focus. We're purely focused on basics, structure, and operator.\nJuan Sanabria: And any color on timeline to get to the stabilized deals. I mean, it just generally ties to the overall length of the recovery. I know it\u2019s just\u2026\nShankh Mitra: Juan, it is purely dependent on the shape of the recovery and when it drops, which I already said that I'm not going to comment on, right. It is a very uncertain environment. That is precisely why we're buying these value opportunities so that we don't have to be dependent on that, right. So if we had a perfect sense of what the shape of the curve looks like and when it perfectly troughs, then we will be buying everything we possibly can, which we are not. We're very focused on a significant discount/replacement cost for that very reason. But again, we need more time to give you a general sense of what that looks like, but it depends on assets to assets. We're buying assets that are 82% occupied. We're buying assets that are 22% occupied. So, it's very hard to make a general comment on when, what we think that sort of the shape of that acquisition [ph]looks like.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nStephen Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning. Shankh and Tim, I know you can't really comment on sort of the exact bottoming and timing of the recovery, but maybe talk about sort of the move-ins and the conditions that you think you need to see within your facilities kind of in the macro in order to ultimately start to drive move-in volume given what we've seen on the decline?\nTimothy McHugh: Yes. Thanks, Steve. So, I think the first and foremost what we've seen and learned over the last 10 months is that one; cases naturally and cases in our buildings have very much married each other. The virus has presented itself as \u2013 it\u2019s pretty challenging kind of keep out of anywhere. So, I think you may talk about the macro and being cases, we're kind of speaking to both of those at the same time, but we've seen both the negative and positive case counts rise and fall, start to impact our business 30 to 45 days afterwards. That makes sense given thinking about kind of the sales cycle on an average kind of 30 days of a kind of start that will lead to a close. So what we need to see is the direction we're seeing right now in case counts to continue. We need to see likely the vaccinations that are going on at a national level in our buildings and then allow for that to be kind of held at a low level. And we're seeing those things take place now, but as of today\u2019s call, we're still very much at an elevated level of cases nationally in our building. So I think what we need to see is for this current level to drastically continue at the low level to sustain itself, and we'll start to see some early indicators of that if that direction continues over the next month or so, and the fundamental impact in our business would come, as I said kind of 30, 45 days after that. So I think it comes down to simply the path of COVID. And it's a big reason of kind of the outlook being one quarter here and not the full-year because I think any full-year outlook would essentially be just more of a guidance on where the path of the virus goes, which is something that we don't think we've got a better view on those of you in the market. So, it really comes down to just COVID.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky from Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nConnor Siversky: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for having me on the call. Appreciate the detail on the prepared remarks. I'm looking at lease maturities, specifically as it relates to the post-acute care portfolio in 2021. I'm just wondering how those conversations are progressing and if there's any kind of expectation for renewal rates?\nTimothy McHugh: I'm sorry. Say that again, Connor, you said which leases?\nConnor Siversky: So the lease maturity is related to the post-acute care portfolio and then how those conversations are progressing?\nShankh Mitra: So Connor, the conversation with all tenants is the same, right. If a tenant wants to focus on what is the right \u2013 near-term fundamentals right now, and project that as the future, then I don't think that's our right tenant, right. I mean, we have to \u2013 you cannot think about this business as what is happening right now and Mark \u2013 at least to market on that basis on today's fundamental. That's just not how we think about it. I laid out the whole framework of how we think about leases in a previous call. I'm not going to bore you with the details, but the conversations are always the same. What is the normalized cash flow of a business? What does that mean from a value as well as the last dollar basis of that lease? The leverage in fact, right? So that's how we think about leases. That's all we do leases, new leases, renewal leases, and that's all going to move forward. If we think that our tenants and us, we can't agree on what is the long-term value of our real estate is. Then we have to move forward with a different operator. Our value is in the real estate and we know how to preserve it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mr. Carroll, if you have your phone on mute, please unmute your line.\nMichael Carroll: I do. Sorry. Tim, with regard to the seniors housing triple-net portfolio in your prepared remarks, can you kind of provide some color on what percent of the operators are being recognized on a cash basis? And I guess what are they paying today versus their contracts for the rents? And just real quick off of that, in that payment coverage stratification heat map that you have, is that coverage ratio reflected on their contractual rent? Or is that reflected on the rent that they're currently paying today?\nTimothy McHugh: Yes. Thanks Mike. So a little over 5% of our triple-net NOI is reflected as cash and not as contractual rent. And on the heat map, if things move to cash, they're removed from the heat map because essentially, at that point are one-for-one in relative to what's being reflected in earnings and what's being received in cash. And that kind of is not relevant to the actual contractual and also could end up kind of inflating coverages. So we \u2013 if it moved to cash, essentially what we move it off because at that point, earnings is reflecting exactly that cash. And I'd say just as kind of relative areas of where we've seen [indiscernible], where EBITDAR has kind of fallen relative to rent, it's kind of probably been in the 0.5x to 0.75x coverage areas.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Good morning. Spot occupancy stands at 74.4% for SHO and with COVID cases declining and most of your residents likely vaccinated by the end of first quarter, is this 275 to 375 basis points of further decline in occupancy that you're guiding, is this your estimate of Welltower\u2019s pandemic trough occupancy given what we know today?\nTimothy McHugh: So what we're estimating in our actual first quarter guidance with \u2013 in my prepared remarks, I alluded this. But if we were to be, if today's occupancy was to be held from here through quarter end, we'd end up at an average occupancy decline from 4Q to 1Q up 260 basis points. And our guidance is for 225 basis points of decline from 4Q to 1Q. So our expectation is that given the heightened COVID cases on a national basis that declines and occupancy continue, and we're not making a call on the direction of COVID, which would therefore impact occupancy. So in short, no, we're not, we are not calling today's occupancy trough.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thanks. Good morning. I know that you guys have some optimism because you've sort of transitioned from defense to offense and began buying assets again. So I just wanted to get a little bit of a sense of what you are thinking is as you're underwriting these assets in terms and I mean, seniors housing specifically in terms of the pace of potential lease up, so on the other side of sort of this spike in COVID, how do you think about what \u2013 and maybe you can give us some brackets for what lease up occupancy might look like during the peak leasing season, like April to September?\nTimothy McHugh: Hey, Jordan. So I can put some brackets around it just thinking through kind of pre-COVID occupancy levels. We've talked a bit this year looking at move-ins as a percentage of pre-COVID levels and to give an idea of not only how much they've declined at start of COVID, but kind of where they sit relative to levels in 2019. If you were to look at kind of move-in levels from April to September 2019 and compare that to move-out levels we saw on the fourth quarter of this year, so just the most recent experience, which is a bit heightened relative to historical. But as you can see in our stats certainly is not spiking. You would see at 100% back to pre-COVID with demand levels 90 to 110 basis points of occupancy increases on a monthly basis. And that's really a product of \u2013 again, demand coming back quite a bit, if you look at January of 2021 and we're at 50% of prior year move-ins. So thinking about that 50% back to pre-COVID levels, that's a quite a climb from here. But another way to look at it is we likely have to get back to kind of 65% of pre-COVID demand levels to get to breakeven on occupancy and then from there build to start to gain. And just putting that in context, when COVID did come down in the late summer, early fall of 2020, we did see demand is measured by move-ins moved back to kind of 70% prior year. So we've seen demand moved back in that range during COVID pre-vaccine. But certainly we're well below that now. So current trends move-ins have gotten worse, but hopefully that gives you an idea of where they could move to if demand really comes back to pre-COVID levels in the short-term and also where we kind of need them to get to just see some stabilization of the portfolio.\nShankh Mitra: Jordan, does not mean that we're underwriting in this April to sort of the early summer to late fall leasing season, we're going to see that kind of occupancy increase. If we did that, we would buy every product that we can possibly buy in the market. So I want to remind you that we are not \u2013 we're focused on basis so that our value creation is not dependent on our ability to pinpoint the shape of the recovery. It is purely depended on what it takes to build a building. And if you can buy at a significant discount, the two things will happen, right. You can wait for the demand to come back. And if you can make money at a \u2013 obviously at a 50% to 60% discount replacement costs, then no one will build a new building, add the replacement costs because they have to charge a lot more than you. So ultimately in any capital heavy asset class like real estate, assuming your overall demand is increasing, ultimately the demand supply is well-balanced. If I can make money at discount replacement costs, you will not be able to make money by building a new one at replacement cost. This is particularly interesting phenomenon in this cycle. In most cycles, what you see is replacement cost, I mean, the cost to build goes down whenever recession hits because housing is [indiscernible], replacement cost is actually spiking through this particular cycle that keeps even a bigger gap as we think through a cycle.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bilerman: Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Just a two-part question, Shankh, just in relation to partners and relationships that you talked about during your opening comments, you talked about $10 billion pipeline of opportunities as you've executed more partnerships over the last nine months than you did in the five years prior, and you mentioned 600,000 pre-lease MOB. Can you just step back and sort of break down that $10 billion, a little bit more detail about what comprises it, what sectors and the timeline? And then the second part sort of the relationships, you talked about this new collaboration with your fellow healthcare REITs, what drove the change in those relationships? I think it's definitely a positive, it's nice to see, but what was the driver because I think you've been a little bit more critical over time and I just want to know what sort of led to these newfound positive relationships?\nShankh Mitra: Okay. Let me take the second one first because that's a easy one. I don't believe that I've ever been critical of our peer companies. What led to the collaboration is that I reached out to my fellow CEOs, and we absolutely agreed that we need to work on this industry issues and operator issues together. And I got a very warm reception. So that\u2019s just very simple, right? I mean, it is true that we have to work on this and there is a power in bigger numbers and we have very smart companies in our space run by very confident and smart management team. It is only in our interest to work together to solve these bigger issues than work alone. So that's a simple one. I'm not going to get into the first question. I will tell you that we are creating, as I said, we're very much focused on from an acquisition side on two things, right? Early cycle opportunities that obviously we're executing and you'll be very pleased as the year progress where that will shake out, but we're very much cognizant of the fact that early cycle opportunities, eventually that will be gone. So if we start working on, then what will eventually become is the normal cycle opportunities to late. So we have never stopped. And it is also pretty much to be a very advantageous position to be a large company in our space \u2013 the largest company in our space, which we're expanding pretty rapidly and we didn't bat an eyelid and stopped. And because we believe in the business as I laid out, we are \u2013 you have to think about it.  This is a very interesting business where you have to work with other people and you have to work with operators. You have to work with developers. In many cases they are one and the same and to go create value together, not at the expense of each other. That alignment is extremely important. And this life nine, 10 months has given us the opportunity to work with more of our operators. And frankly speaking, as you can see, being aligned with Welltower, has created significant and is continued to create significant value for our operators who \u2013 if you think about if you're not aligned with an capital source that has the capability and the fierce resolve to deploy capital to this kind of disruption, then ultimately, as I said, you come to the other end of the cycle and it's too late. So I'm not going to get into what that looks like. I'll just give you one example, 600,000 square feet of 100% pre-leased MOBs, Michael, you can do the math and think about how much value creation. And that is not a pipeline that is just a start that we're sitting here today between 2021 and 2022.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Hughes: Hey. Good morning. Could you talk about your underwriting assumptions on the recent SHOP acquisitions at a mid-three yield? And the reason I ask is because using some of the assumptions laid out in the December 2018 Investor Day, like exit price and 7% IRR requirement, it implies a high single-digit NOI growth CAGR for the next decade. I know you won't comment on the growth and the recovery trajectory, but maybe some of those other assumptions like exit price have changed versus two-plus years ago. So any details or thoughts about how you underwrite SHOP and compare to perhaps now higher yielding, but more stable and slower growing medical office buildings would be helpful? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Jonathan. It depends \u2013 obviously every asset is different where you buy the asset, what basis you buy the asset is completely different. When we made that presentation, we never thought we'll be able to buy assets at \u2013 and meaningful discount replacement costs. If we look at pre-pandemic, healthcare real estate, particularly on the senior housing, usually traded at a mild to modest premium to replacement costs because the healthcare income has a multiple, not a real estate multiple, but it's still a multiple, right? So in asset class where you\u2019re starting above some level of replacement costs, you're going to keep your pricing power really strong through the whole cycle. And the next buyer analysis, you have to think about your next buyer analysis. And the next buyer has to also believe that we'll continue. That by implication, you are buying above replacement costs and you are selling above replacement costs or you were making a bet that the NOI growth, if you're \u2013 NOI growth will meaningfully outstrip the cost of construction increase, right? So in both sides, you are at some form of above replacement costs. That equation changes completely when you can buy at a significant discount replacement costs. So if you buy $0.50 on the $1 and at some period of normalization, you sell it at 100 cents on the $1. You are still at a significant discount to the previous case, when your next buyers\u2019 analysis it's much, much easier. Nothing has changed except the price and that price tells you why we're so excited about it today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer from Baird. Please go ahead.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Great. Thanks for taking the question. As you kind of think about building occupancy post-pandemic, how are you thinking either about changing service levels or where and how you invest CapEx if at all in order to attract new residents?\nShankh Mitra: Okay. So this is a question that I don't want to be too long-winded and give you an answer. It depends on the price \u2013 really the service level of the assets inside those buildings today. And we don't increase occupancy our operating partners do. And we work with our operating partners on service levels CapEx needed and everything, but this is a collaborative process. And I don't want to sort of sit here and tell you that this is \u2013 we have the operating expertise to do that. I'm assuming you're asking a SHOP question. We have the best operators in the business that are very, very good of what they do and their local dominance in the marketplace, obviously, as well as this particular service area is very much of what we are depending on. Having said that, we have worked diligently with our operators on payers and provider integration, and as I said, this is a very long answer to a question. We're happy to take this offline. And have you talked too much ever \u2013 obviously this process in our SHOP, but the pricing question, the service question is more of an operator question than a Welltower question, CapEx question is definitely something that we work together. Having said that the payer and provider integration is something that we're leading and our operators are collaborating with us, but that's a long discussion. And we'll take this up offline if this is of interest to you.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRichard Anderson: Thanks and good morning. And just a comment, the olive branch are extending your peers and they to you, is like red meat to me. So happy to hear about that type of collaboration in the space. And speaking of collaboration, one of the things the gaming sector has noticed \u2013 gaming REIT sector has noticed the ability to expand margins post-pandemic and some lessons learned about what was kind of wasteful in their four walls and perhaps a better product at the other side of this. Question is on SHOP. I know there is a lot of talk about margins going down, of course, these days, but do you envision that there will be some positive lessons learned from all this and that ultimately part of your interest in senior housing and SHOP specifically is that there is a margin expansion sort of thesis down the road here, maybe two, three years down the road, perhaps that will come out of this or should we not be thinking along those lines?\nTimothy McHugh: So Richard that's a very good question. It's one we've talked about a lot actually with our operators through the last period kind of the last six months. I think I'll answer in two ways. The first is on lessons learned. Absolutely, this has made our operators look at their cost constructs in a more critical way than they probably ever could or imagined just given the pressure to occupancy and getting back the levels that for a lot of them look like they haven't done in since at least of some of these assets years ago. We've had feedback from operators and large platform saying they've found ways to do things from labor front, just a lot more efficiently. And given the feedback ahead of time to what you're speaking to that when you start to see the business come back and you think there is significant cost savings in the \u2013 particularly the labor model as far as getting a bit more leverage off it. Again, in the margin side, I would hesitate to kind of speak to that from a margin expansion story just driven purely by that as of yet. As you know, there's cost and the structure right now that are being added because of COVID. We feel pretty confident that a lot of these things are temporary. But given that, there's two things to speak now as kind of a market expansion story. We're having those cost in the current business and having an unclear picture of when and how the kind of the virus moves away from our business. I think it would be a bit aggressive. But I do think the margin expansion story of thinking about it relative to even where we were pre-pandemic. We think there's an occupancy lift story in this space just given the demand story and that makes us \u2013 still keeps us very positive in the spaces that long-term demand story hasn't changed in the pandemic. And certainly has been a very impactful last nine months, 12 months, and need to continue to be in the near future. But the long-term demand story stands and that's going to lift occupancy and there's a lot of operating leverage in this business even without changes to the structure. So you're going to see as kind of industry occupancy lift up over the next three to five years, I think you are going to see margins move above where they were pre-pandemic even without those operating efficiencies being put into the model.\nShankh Mitra: Rich, I would just add two things. One is that, we obviously \u2013 I would encourage you and our team would be happy to set it up to talk to Mark Shaver in our team with what we're doing on the payer provider side, and which should help margin as well. The second lessons learned, I would say not a margin point, but the separate point is one of the lessons learned in our SHOP through not just this pandemic, but through last few years, is that you should not lend money to an entity or any type of entity where you are not willing to take the keys, right. As of REIT, we're not allowed to obviously own an operating company more than 35%. So we should not lend money to operating companies where we're not able to take over the assets. Today, we're only focused \u2013 obviously in the last few years, and through the cycle, through the pandemic, we're only focused on if we write a credit check, we only write, if we are completely able to take over the assets and we're very happy owner of the assets on the last dollar exposure that we have. That is a big lessons learned inside our SHOP and a good one for the long-term value creation of our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So a couple of questions just here on the vaccine rollout. Clearly that's important in terms of getting move-in activity back. So I was hoping to get some stats on what the adoption rate has been of the vaccine by residents and staff members so far. And then I'm also wondering, we saw an announcement from Atria, which was very vocal saying that they were requiring staff members to get vaccinated by May. And we haven't seen anything from Sunrise. And so I guess I'm wondering as a part owner there in Sunrise, are you guys pushing for that policy and maybe just give us an update on kind of what that policy is in regards to staff members across your operators in assisted living? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Nick, I\u2019ll answer the second question and Mark will answer the first question. We have tremendous amount of respect for John Moore and his team at Atria. We do not comment on the vaccine policy of different operators. We work with our operators and supportive of their different policies. I can tell you everybody's focus is to get to the right place. How they get there is the decisions that the management teams and the CEOs of specific operators to take that. We do not push for one or the other, but I can tell you that everybody is focused on the same outcome. Mark?\nMark Shaver: Yes. So just to give some stats, the relationships the operators have with CVS and Walgreens has worked quite positively. We've seen over 120,000 vaccinations across the platform as of earlier this week. About 90% of our communities have completed their first clinic and very actively working through the second clinic we feel by the end of February, 1st week of March. Most, if not all of the second clinics will have taken place. With regards to adoption and consent, 90 plus percent of residents have consent or receive the vaccination, 55% of staff across the portfolio that varies from operator-to-operator have consented to receive the vaccination. We're not going to get into specifics on number of vaccines by individuals. Some of this is skewed. You maybe aware that if there was active COVID or inactive COVID diagnosis in the prior 28 days, an individual has to wait to delay that. So we're focusing really on consent and the percentage of vaccinations that have occurred across the communities. But what happened to provide additional color, but those are the highlights.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Mueller: Yes. Curious how are the yields on the various new developments you're looking at compared to what underwriting would have been in pre-pandemic?\nShankh Mitra: Our target yields Mike have not changed. Market conditions have changed, so obviously or even more critically thinking about the cost as well as the land price and ultimately how much it takes to \u2013 obviously how long it takes to get to that stabilization and the working capital loss in between, right. So our focus, again, as I\u2019ve said, you have to imagine these things. They're long-term. We think about at least the developments that we're interested in. You're talking about a five, six-year cycles, so you have to really, really think hard about when do you start, when it actually finishes, when you get your approval. And just for an example, as you know that for last few months or last year or so, we have worked on in new development project in Brooklyn. It is one of the hardest place to build in the country, right. You can't change your view depending on how you're feeling about your occupancy today. That's a five to seven year process. And so our return thresholds have not changed. Clearly, what we think sort of the trended yields, the trending has changed given what is going on in the business today, and we still need to make money on an untrended basis to start this development. So that's how we're thinking about it.\nMichael Mueller: Got it. Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nTodd Stender: Thanks. Your data analytics team has been instrumental in having you guys drill down on MSAs just for senior housing, of course. But can you share the recommendations that they're providing now just in light of lingering new supply out migration from more urban cities due to COVID, maybe any specifics you can share?\nShankh Mitra: So Todd, we have the ability to tell you today. First is that not just focused on senior housing the team has built. The platform has been enhanced pretty meaningfully in last few quarters, so we have the ability. We're beyond what you have seen in senior housing into medical office and other housing businesses such as active adult, where you play pretty heavily. One of the questions that you raised, which is the migration pattern, you can do. We have a team \u2013 entire team, which has been working on this data scientist. Today, I'm glad to tell you that we have the ability to pinpoint that out migration or in migration on a weekly basis, not just focused on the longer-term data such as ACS and IRS data, but also cellphone data and other more near-term or more instantaneous sort of data. I don't mean instantaneous in right at this point, but we can tell you most on a weekly basis \u2013 not almost on a weekly basis, we can tell you on a weekly basis where people have moved out or moved in. That is very much flowing we\u2019re through models as we're making investments. As you know, that we're very, very focused on making new investments on all the asset classes we deal in. And it's definitely a big part of why we're seeing today the attractiveness of us as the capital has enhanced in last few months or few quarters because we're still standing here and taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace, but also that huge predictive analytics platform that we have built over many years that our partners are attracted to.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So a couple of questions here. I guess, first regarding REVPOR, it was encouraging to see the positive year-over-year trends in 4Q 2020 in AL high urban senior apartments in that 1% to 4% range. In your walkthrough of the FFO sequentially into 1Q 2021, you mentioned that\u2019s $0.06 hit from a fundamental decline in senior housing, I guess, I'm curious, what's the REVPOR assumption within that? Does that stay positive year-over-year, or does that start to decline? Thanks.\nTimothy McHugh: Yes, that's a good question, Steve. So when you think about on a sequential basis that $0.06 that moves from 4Q to 1Q effectively, so think about like REVPOR and occupancy decline combining to get your revenue change, sequentially, our REVPOR is down 20 basis points, but that's driven by two things. 40% of our senior housing revenue in the fourth quarter is actually from operators that receive rent on a daily basis, which is pretty common in the higher acuity side of senior living. And so just moving from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, you lose two days, you go from 92 days to 90 days. So with REVPOR being an approximation of monthly rent, your rent will go down 2.2% just from that. So there's a headwind from that on a sequential REVPOR basis. And then you've got this continued mix shift where the occupancies and mix shift, the make-up of revenue in the fourth quarter versus first quarter, again, you're seeing a higher occupancy fall off in the higher acuity segments of our portfolio, which pay higher rent. So in combination of those two things is the REVPOR from how that impacts kind of total revenue is down 20 basis points. But if you look at on a per day per unit rent were up 2.1% in the fourth quarter relative to the first quarter, and it's actually pretty strong sequential growth and it\u2019s driven mainly by \u2013 roughly half of our operators also have Jan 1 increases. So there\u2019s increases that\u2019s pushed through on Jan 1 and that's helped kind of rent growth.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich from Green Street. Please go ahead.\nLukas Hartwich: Thanks. Hey, Shankh, in the past, you've talked about Welltower and difference between the SH-NNN and SHOP format is structured correctly. I'm curious how the teams evaluating that question for the existing portfolio, as well as acquisitions in this environment because, clearly there's a lot more uncertainty and not only near-term fundamentals, but the recovery, the trajectory, potential long-term impacts in the senior housing business. Still a lot of moving pieces relative to the history there.\nShankh Mitra: Well, I think you just coined a new time. I'm assuming you're asking about the difference between senior housing triple-net versus senior housing operating. So look, given where the cycle is, I want to be a majority being the equity position are in the RIDEA side. But there are opportunities to deploy capital in the senior housing in a triple-net side. If you have assets that are stabilized and you can buy it cheap enough that the last dollar of that lease is still in a place where the operators can make money and we can make money. Obviously, you can create a lot of bells and whistles than what the operators have the second bite of the Apple. So there's ways you can create that alignment, but remember, if you simplistically think about RIDEA is an equity exposure and at least it's more of a credit exposure, you can create value if a) from our side, if the buildings are stabilized or near stabilization and you buy it cheap enough that your last dollar is still a pretty low rent relative to what the cash flow of the buildings look like then you can create value, but that's how we think about it. That's how our operators think about it. And so we have found two opportunities to do leases. If we do find more opportunities, we'll do it, but I can tell you that the industry is moving away, at least we're moving away from very tightly covered leases. Today, we're thinking about there should be even more margin of safety, and when we find opportunities where we're buying so cheap that we can that's when we're going for it.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey. Good morning, guys. Shankh, I just wanted to follow-up on your comment in your opening remarks about hiring [indiscernible]. I think you said 41 employees last year. Curious, just what area of the business are you guys hiring\u2026\nShankh Mitra: Pretty much across the Board, I mean, if you think about it, we have added a lot of people on our investment teams and we have hired a lot of people on that data analytics team, we hired a lot of \u2013 hiring people on our infrastructure teams or accounting, tax. I don't have the background. I can tell you that we have seen an incredible resurgence of interest in our asset in our company today from both sort of externally and internally. And what I mean externally as an operator, as developers, internally as prospective employees. Both experienced employees that we're hiring there's a lot of talent in the market for obvious disruption. Also a lot of early career employees that we're seeing. I'll just tell you just one small stat. Interesting one, doesn't change really when we do. We hire \u2013 East Coast, West Coast and Midwest, we hire the top seven schools for MBA candidates. This year, we got more than 1,400 applications for really four or five positions we hire. So that sort of tells you the interest in our business and the amount of incredible talent we're seeing both on the early career side as well as super experienced side, and we'll see some really good hires this year as well. This year, I expect that we'll add 40 to 50 professionals across the Board in the company. Acquisition is not just as I said, I want you to think about, Josh, acquisition in this kind of market, which is so disruptive in three ways. One, obvious one, right, we're doing value opportunities that we can add, edit discount replacement costs; b) acquisition of partnership and operator relationship and developer relationship, that's B; c) is employees. We're in a business of talent and given the amount of disruption that's in the marketplace that we see and what we think this business will become as we think about three years, five years, 10 years from now. We're very much adding an incredible level of talent that we have sort of never seen in the marketplace.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Great. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning, everyone. First of all, Shankh and Tim, I just wanted to give your entire team credit for such strong transparent disclosure on your business updates. I wish more of your peers were doing that. And also regards to Tom, I hope he's doing well. My first question really is around government support. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of post the Phase III announcement kind of what you've seen in the pipeline at this point or what the lobby group is seeing, what the potential is for the government released for your operators?\nShankh Mitra: So let me take your question and see what I can get there. I'm not going to comment on sort of what might happen. There's too much uncertainty. We have a new administration. If I sit here and try to comment on what might happen, I'll be so much outside my zone of confidence, which I think, you know, that I focus very much on talking about confidence. Being a lifelong Buffett and Munger, sort of decide, I'm not going to answer that. But I will tell you that Tom is doing well. I talk to him pretty frequently. He has been an incredible mentor and a friend. He continues to help me think through a lot of issues and he's definitely doing well. If you reach out to him, he will reply to you, but he's definitely doing well and he remains safe, great supporter of the company and he's helping any way he can.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Bernstein: Hey. Good morning. I appreciate you staying on and taking the calls here. It seems to me that the initial acquisitions you've done here, I mean, clearly the disruption you're buying it below replacement costs, but they're not really truly distressed sales. So just trying to understand what you're seeing in the marketplace in terms of lenders, bankers, kind of exercising covenants, enforcing more distressed sales the remainder of this year, especially given your comments on a strong pipeline. And I know if you can talk difference between that distress in senior housing and skilled nursing? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Like beauty, distress is also something that lies in the eyes of the beholder. I can tell you Dan, we're buying assets in core markets of New Jersey, Seattle, California for less than $200,000 a unit where replacement cost is $400,000, $500,000 above $500,000 a unit. If you don't think that's a deep value opportunity, I really don't know how to answer to that. So I guess, we just have to obviously think about it different way. We are \u2013 if you just always remember price relative to what it takes to build that gap is what we've distressed. If you just want to look at purely on a price per pound and does it look cheap, just wait for a few, as I said, 60 to 90 days, I can tell you more about some of those opportunities that we're seeing. But I think we\u2019re executing on some very significant sort of discount replacement cost opportunities, some we have reported. And if you look at what those assets are and dig into what it takes to build it, you will understand that. So going back to the banks, look, I have no idea when the banks will obviously push more towards \u2013 sort of pushing these sort of these whole pipeline of new construction that happened between 2015 and 2019 from their books. But I can tell you that we have been working diligently with many of our banking partners. Just yesterday we executed on one such loan. Look, we're here open for business. We have a sense of what the value is. We have a sense of how we can create value, not just at the buy, but also with our operating partners and we're executing. But I can't sit here and tell you when the banks will pick the books. That\u2019s just no way to say that.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks again for sticking on. Just to go back to sort of the potential inflection. I know you can't give near-term prognosis on when that's going to happen. But just in terms of early indicators both on move-ins and move-outs, Tim I found your comment that 65% needed for stabilization, interesting. I'm just wondering, in the different geographies given the COVID cases have trended somewhat differently, and that has a correlation to the move-ins. Any early signs you're seeing on monitoring that would suggest move-in and move-outs kind of can turn the other way.\nTimothy McHugh: So there is not \u2013 I think as far as early indicators, we haven't seen enough to note it as a trend, I'd say. You certainly have seen operators where you've seen deposits or tours or initial inquiries move up. You've also seen \u2013 as your question goes, you've seen it move down in geographies in which you've had, essentially last six to eight weeks has been shutoff in a lot of ways. So not enough of a trend on the initial indicators or first movers to say that there's something there. I do think part of what I was getting on earlier is what we've seen in the past. You follow some of the first indicators being inquiries and quest for tours, et cetera. You've seen that kind of lag cases in that kind of 30 to 45 day range. So what we've seen in cases, in fact that there\u2019s still very high may make this time a bit different as far as how much time it takes to post it, but just thinking about it a mid-January kind of peak in cases, you would likely \u2013 if things continue on this trend, the positive trend we're seeing, I think you\u2019ve start to see towards the middle or the end of the month, maybe some of those first indicators move in a more portfolio wide basis. And so we can provide some more color on that as we update the market over the next month or two, but right now it\u2019s too early to speak to it.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Hi, good morning. Thanks for continuing to go on. My question actually ties into what Vikram was just saying. If the inflection rate trends have been getting better over the past few weeks, you guys kind of talk about a 45 day lag, I guess it does seem to indicate to me that things should get better in the back half of the quarter. But yet you have 260 basis points of average occupancy, big decline backed in today, but the guidance for 1Q is 275 to 375 basis points. So guidance \u2013 a few things actually get worse in the back half of the quarter versus better. Could you just help me clarify that?\nTimothy McHugh: Yes. I appreciate the question. To clarify that a bit, we're saying if the trends were to continue and I think you\u2019re saying the same, you would start to see some improvement in latter part of the quarter. But trends getting better from here or staying the same as the part that we're not taking a position on. And so certainly if that continues that way, that's when we start to see some improvement, our guidance doesn't take a position on COVID in the path of it. It's even today despite where we've come off of. Case counts in every way, shape or form are higher than any point we've given a forward look in the past nine months. So today still there is a lot of uncertainty. It certainly feels better than it did three or four weeks ago. But what's baked into guidance in our view is not an attempt to call for a better or a continued improvement and it's more of a current state holding.\nShankh Mitra: Also Tayo, as Tim sort of pointed out before majority of the decline is on an average basis is already baked in, right. So if you see the improvement that you are hoping for, which we're not hoping for, we're not guiding for then that will more impact the second quarter than the first quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A session and today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect at this time. Everyone have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Timothy McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2020 results, the performance of all of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update and our first quarter outlook. The fourth quarter was a tough end to a very challenging year as the ongoing impact that coronavirus accelerated meaningfully in the back half of the fourth quarter and into the beginning of 2021. The visibility for large parts of our business beyond the next 90 days remain very limited and very dependent on virus-related variables, such as its unpredictable path of growth, the rollout and efficacy of the vaccine and the continuation of population lockdown mandates. As a result of this uncertainty, we decided to provide our first quarter outlook this morning in place of the full-year outlook we would normally provide in our fourth quarter call. As we have done over the last year, we will continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis, with the intention of providing a more complete outlook, as soon as the variants of the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for liable forecasting. Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $0.39 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.84 per diluted share. Normalized FFO was sequentially flat in third quarter and the decline in senior housing operating earnings and dilution from disposition to close over the last two quarters was offset by recognition of HHS funds, lower G&A, lower interest expense, and initial returns on reinvested capital. Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, with our Triple-Net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflected trailing 12 months ending 9/30/2020, and therefore, only reflect a partial impact from COVID-19. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the fourth quarter, having collected 97% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period. Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio. Same-store NOI declined 2.7% year-over-year as leases that were moved to cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against prior full-year contractual rent received. Occupancy was down 260 basis points sequentially consistent with the average occupancy drop from 2Q to 3Q in our RIDEA portfolio and EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01x on a sequential basis in this portfolio to 1.01x. During the quarter, we transitioned a UK development portfolio from triple-net to RIDEA, transitioned 14 former triple-net capital senior assets to new operators in RIDEA structures and disposed of one asset to the net impact of increasing coverage by 0.03x. Consistent with my comments in the past, our senior housing triple-net lease operators experienced similar headwinds as our RIDEA operators over the past nine months and we expect reported lease coverage stats to continue to reflect these challenges as more of the pandemic periods reflected in EBITDAR going forward. That being said, resilience of this portfolio is reflected by the continued high cash collection rate is encouraging. As I described last quarter, we entered into agreement with Capital Senior at beginning of 2020, which allowed for an early termination of CSU leases on 24 Welltower owned assets in exchange for full rent being paid in 2020 in cooperation with transitioning the operations of these assets. We transitioned 14 properties operated by CSU to new operators in the fourth quarter in addition to the five that were transitioned during the third quarter and anticipate the remaining assets to be transitioned to new operators in the first half of 2021. As a result of the continued COVID backdrop, the initial expected dilution from these conversions is expected to be approximately $0.04 per share in 2021. Additionally, the conversion of a development portfolio in the UK from triple-net to RIDEA is also expected to be negatively impact normalized FFO by $0.04 per share in 2021. The combination of these two transitions is expected to result in a sequential roll down with a little over $0.02 per share of normalized FFO from Q4 to Q1. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated 2% year-over-year same-store growth. However, EBITDAR coverage declined by 0.012x sequentially to 1.0x, which was almost entirely due to deterioration in largest long-term post-acute tenant Genesis HealthCare. As we noted last quarter, Genesis HealthCare, which makes up approximately half of our long-term post-acute exposure raise concerns around its ability to continue as a going concern in the second quarter financials filed on August 10. As a result of this concern, Welltower began recording revenue on a cash basis in the third quarter. Furthermore, we wrote down our unsecured loan exposure driven by $80 million in the fourth quarter. Similar to our Genesis lease income, we've been recognizing all interest on our unsecured loans on a cash basis. So this impairment does not change income recognition on these loans. Genesis remains current on all financial obligations to Welltower through January. And lastly, health systems, which comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 2.27x. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical office portfolio delivered positive 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth modestly below long-term trends. Growth continues to be negatively impacted by reserves for uncollected rent, the large majority of which resulting from lease enforcement moratoriums in several California jurisdictions in which we have a sizable footprint as I described last quarter. As these moratoriums expire, we expect rent collection to improve from 98.5% received in the fourth quarter. Looking back at 2020, our outpatient medical platform displayed incredible resilience in a truly challenging year, which includes periods of time, which basic medical appointments and procedures were flat out, not permitted. We still managed to grow same-store NOI in an average of positive 1.7%. During the fourth quarter, we continued to observe improvements in several key operating trends as business continue to normalize, notably a pickup in our leasing pipeline, which has start to reflect positive occupancy pickup towards the back half of 2021. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's result, I want to point out that we received approximately $9 million from the Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act Provider Relief Fund and post-quarter we received another $34 million, delivering $8 million and $31 million of net expected proceeds at our share. We are recognizing these funds on a cash basis and so there were flow through financials at quarter in which they are received. We are normalizing these HHS funds on a same-store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received that are not matched to expenses incurred in the period they received. In the fourth quarter, there are approximately $11.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied with HHS program in the U.S. Now turning to results in the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 33.8% as compared to fourth quarter of 2019 and decreased 11.3% sequentially from the third quarter. Starting with revenue, sequential same-store revenue was down 2.4% in Q4 driven primarily by 160 basis point drop in average occupancy. As a reminder, we started the fourth quarter with relative optimism on the occupancy front with improving year-over-year moving volumes and relatively low prevalence of COVID within our communities. However, these positive trends rapidly reverse as the exponential rise in global COVID cases in November and December, but the city and statewide lockdowns, admissions bans across many of our key MSAs particularly in the UK and California, which together comprised 34% of our SHO Portfolio NOI. Result of this was 180 basis points of occupancy loss from November through year-end. As I stated on our third quarter call, the path of COVID will dictate our business trend from the fourth quarter, not seasonality and not the seasonal flu, and that has proved quite true over the past 3.5 months. Turning to REVPOR in the quarter, total SHO Portfolio REVPOR was down 1.2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. But as I described last quarter, mix shift is restored in the true picture of rent growth metrics. The standalone year-over-year REVPOR growth for active adult, independent living and assisted living segments were positive 3.7%, 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively. The combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by considerable changes in composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio, as lower acuity properties, independent living and senior departments have held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID. We just had the mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity and therefore, lower rent paying units. The point being rental rates are proving more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics. And lastly, expenses, total same-store expenses declined 2.1% year-over-year and increased 50 basis points, sequentially. I'll focus on the sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 50 basis point increase in operating costs was driven mainly by higher sequential COVID costs as a result of the surge in cases in the fourth quarter. Decline in topline combined with these expense pressures had a meaningful impact on our operating margins, which declined 220 basis points sequentially to 22.3%. As I noted earlier in the call, we did not include government reimbursement that was not tied to period expenses \u2013 NPL expenses in our same-store results, and therefore, COVID expenses negatively impact same-store by $18.9 million in the quarter. We will stay consistent with distribution in Q1, where we've already received a net $31 million in HHS funds that would likely turn COVID expenses into a net benefit if included in our same-stores and offset. Looking forward to the first quarter and starting with 2021 year-to-date data we have already observed. We've experienced 180 basis point decline in occupancy through February 5. Given the still heightened presence of COVID, we expect average occupancy to be down 275 to 375 basis points from fourth quarter to first quarter. Note that we are providing the average occupancy as opposed to spot occupancy as a former better tie to our reported financials, and therefore, 260 basis points of our expected 275 to 375 basis point decline is already baked given the swift drop from mid-November to-date in occupancy. We expect monthly REVPOR to be down 20 basis points sequentially, although it should be noted that actual rent per unit is up 2.1% sequentially. With mix shift, which I mentioned earlier, and two fewer days in the quarter is Q1 reported REVPOR versus actual rent growth. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat as higher sequential COVID costs are offset by less labor utilization due to lower occupancy levels. Turning to capital markets activity. Throughout 2020, we took a series of actions that were difficult result in our ability to retain significant cash flow and ultimately gave us greater control to navigate through the pandemic. It's worth highlighting that despite the stress driven by our business, we've avoided the destabilization of the balance sheet by borrowing to pay the dividend or being forced in raising equity or selling assets on attractive valuations. Given where we sit today, the $2.1 billion of cash in over $5.1 billion of available liquidity, we are pleased with our course of actions being the most prudent way to maximize balance sheets stability and positioning us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities. In addition to showing up a balance sheet, we undertook a series of actions to optimize spend and maximize retaining cash flow by reducing our corporate overhead through tighter cost controls and fine tuning of capital expenditure plans. We also made the decision in May to reduce our quarterly dividend by 30%, given the uncertainties from the pandemic timeline and severity. Despite the pandemic substantial negative impact on our business, our actions throughout 2020 removed any dependence on a quick recovery, and also afforded us the opportunity to be patient with respect to the transaction market and take advantage of attractive private market valuations relative to public markets, while also highlighting institutional demand for a high quality portfolio. Over the course of the year, we sold $3.7 billion of pro rata assets at a blended 5.4% yield, including $1.3 billion of senior housing operating assets at a price per unit of 332,000 per PPE. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we sold a portfolio of senior housing operating properties operated by Northbridge for $200 million, representing a 4.9% cap rate on March trailing 12-month NOI and $395,000 per unit. Also in the fourth quarter, we announced a new joint venture partnership with certain investment vehicles managed by Wafra. The joint venture comprised a portfolio of 24 outpatient medical properties previously majority owned by Welltower. Many of these transactions were completed in the midst of significant disruption to real estate and capital markets, when the long-term viability of our senior housing assets in particular were being called into question. While we are pleased with execution on disposition front, we're excited to now be executing on the acquisition side with financial flexibility and ample liquidity. On our third quarter earnings call, Shankh described $1 billion acquisition pipeline. And since the start of the fourth quarter, we've closed on $657 million at a blended initial yield of 4.5% with an expected stabilized yield over 7.5%. Lastly, moving to our first quarter outlook. Last time we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.24 to $0.29 and normalized per diluted share of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. The midpoint of our guidance $0.735 per share represents a sequential decline of approximately $0.105 per share from the fourth quarter. The $0.105 decline is composed of a $0.08 decline in senior housing operating results driven by $0.06 of fundamental decline and $0.02 of increased COVID cost. A $0.03 per share sequential decline in triple-net senior housing NOI, a little over $0.02 of which is related to the Capital Senior and signature UK transitions mentioned earlier with the remainder due to fundamental declines on cash recognition leases. A $0.02 per share decline related to net investment activity in Q4 and Q1 and $0.03 related to a combination of other items mainly made up of increased G&A, income tax and a slight decline in interest income. These declines are offset by a 5.5% increase in pro rata HHS funds received to date in the first quarter. As a reminder, we are only guiding the HHS funds that have already been received as of today's call. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Yes. Thanks, Steve. So, I think the first and foremost what we've seen and learned over the last 10 months is that one; cases naturally and cases in our buildings have very much married each other. The virus has presented itself as \u2013 it's pretty challenging kind of keep out of anywhere. So, I think you may talk about the macro and being cases, we're kind of speaking to both of those at the same time, but we've seen both the negative and positive case counts rise and fall, start to impact our business 30 to 45 days afterwards. That makes sense given thinking about kind of the sales cycle on an average kind of 30 days of a kind of start that will lead to a close. So what we need to see is the direction we're seeing right now in case counts to continue. We need to see likely the vaccinations that are going on at a national level in our buildings and then allow for that to be kind of held at a low level. And we're seeing those things take place now, but as of today's call, we're still very much at an elevated level of cases nationally in our building. So I think what we need to see is for this current level to drastically continue at the low level to sustain itself, and we'll start to see some early indicators of that if that direction continues over the next month or so, and the fundamental impact in our business would come, as I said kind of 30, 45 days after that. So I think it comes down to simply the path of COVID. And it's a big reason of kind of the outlook being one quarter here and not the full-year because I think any full-year outlook would essentially be just more of a guidance on where the path of the virus goes, which is something that we don't think we've got a better view on those of you in the market. So, it really comes down to just COVID. I'm sorry. Say that again, Connor, you said which leases? Yes. Thanks Mike. So a little over 5% of our triple-net NOI is reflected as cash and not as contractual rent. And on the heat map, if things move to cash, they're removed from the heat map because essentially, at that point are one-for-one in relative to what's being reflected in earnings and what's being received in cash. And that kind of is not relevant to the actual contractual and also could end up kind of inflating coverages. So we \u2013 if it moved to cash, essentially what we move it off because at that point, earnings is reflecting exactly that cash. And I'd say just as kind of relative areas of where we've seen [indiscernible], where EBITDAR has kind of fallen relative to rent, it's kind of probably been in the 0.5x to 0.75x coverage areas. So what we're estimating in our actual first quarter guidance with \u2013 in my prepared remarks, I alluded this. But if we were to be, if today's occupancy was to be held from here through quarter end, we'd end up at an average occupancy decline from 4Q to 1Q up 260 basis points. And our guidance is for 225 basis points of decline from 4Q to 1Q. So our expectation is that given the heightened COVID cases on a national basis that declines and occupancy continue, and we're not making a call on the direction of COVID, which would therefore impact occupancy. So in short, no, we're not, we are not calling today's occupancy trough. Hey, Jordan. So I can put some brackets around it just thinking through kind of pre-COVID occupancy levels. We've talked a bit this year looking at move-ins as a percentage of pre-COVID levels and to give an idea of not only how much they've declined at start of COVID, but kind of where they sit relative to levels in 2019. If you were to look at kind of move-in levels from April to September 2019 and compare that to move-out levels we saw on the fourth quarter of this year, so just the most recent experience, which is a bit heightened relative to historical. But as you can see in our stats certainly is not spiking. You would see at 100% back to pre-COVID with demand levels 90 to 110 basis points of occupancy increases on a monthly basis. And that's really a product of \u2013 again, demand coming back quite a bit, if you look at January of 2021 and we're at 50% of prior year move-ins. So thinking about that 50% back to pre-COVID levels, that's a quite a climb from here. But another way to look at it is we likely have to get back to kind of 65% of pre-COVID demand levels to get to breakeven on occupancy and then from there build to start to gain. And just putting that in context, when COVID did come down in the late summer, early fall of 2020, we did see demand is measured by move-ins moved back to kind of 70% prior year. So we've seen demand moved back in that range during COVID pre-vaccine. But certainly we're well below that now. So current trends move-ins have gotten worse, but hopefully that gives you an idea of where they could move to if demand really comes back to pre-COVID levels in the short-term and also where we kind of need them to get to just see some stabilization of the portfolio. So Richard that's a very good question. It's one we've talked about a lot actually with our operators through the last period kind of the last six months. I think I'll answer in two ways. The first is on lessons learned. Absolutely, this has made our operators look at their cost constructs in a more critical way than they probably ever could or imagined just given the pressure to occupancy and getting back the levels that for a lot of them look like they haven't done in since at least of some of these assets years ago. We've had feedback from operators and large platform saying they've found ways to do things from labor front, just a lot more efficiently. And given the feedback ahead of time to what you're speaking to that when you start to see the business come back and you think there is significant cost savings in the \u2013 particularly the labor model as far as getting a bit more leverage off it. Again, in the margin side, I would hesitate to kind of speak to that from a margin expansion story just driven purely by that as of yet. As you know, there's cost and the structure right now that are being added because of COVID. We feel pretty confident that a lot of these things are temporary. But given that, there's two things to speak now as kind of a market expansion story. We're having those cost in the current business and having an unclear picture of when and how the kind of the virus moves away from our business. I think it would be a bit aggressive. But I do think the margin expansion story of thinking about it relative to even where we were pre-pandemic. We think there's an occupancy lift story in this space just given the demand story and that makes us \u2013 still keeps us very positive in the spaces that long-term demand story hasn't changed in the pandemic. And certainly has been a very impactful last nine months, 12 months, and need to continue to be in the near future. But the long-term demand story stands and that's going to lift occupancy and there's a lot of operating leverage in this business even without changes to the structure. So you're going to see as kind of industry occupancy lift up over the next three to five years, I think you are going to see margins move above where they were pre-pandemic even without those operating efficiencies being put into the model. Yes, that's a good question, Steve. So when you think about on a sequential basis that $0.06 that moves from 4Q to 1Q effectively, so think about like REVPOR and occupancy decline combining to get your revenue change, sequentially, our REVPOR is down 20 basis points, but that's driven by two things. 40% of our senior housing revenue in the fourth quarter is actually from operators that receive rent on a daily basis, which is pretty common in the higher acuity side of senior living. And so just moving from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, you lose two days, you go from 92 days to 90 days. So with REVPOR being an approximation of monthly rent, your rent will go down 2.2% just from that. So there's a headwind from that on a sequential REVPOR basis. And then you've got this continued mix shift where the occupancies and mix shift, the make-up of revenue in the fourth quarter versus first quarter, again, you're seeing a higher occupancy fall off in the higher acuity segments of our portfolio, which pay higher rent. So in combination of those two things is the REVPOR from how that impacts kind of total revenue is down 20 basis points. But if you look at on a per day per unit rent were up 2.1% in the fourth quarter relative to the first quarter, and it's actually pretty strong sequential growth and it's driven mainly by \u2013 roughly half of our operators also have Jan 1 increases. So there's increases that's pushed through on Jan 1 and that's helped kind of rent growth. So there is not \u2013 I think as far as early indicators, we haven't seen enough to note it as a trend, I'd say. You certainly have seen operators where you've seen deposits or tours or initial inquiries move up. You've also seen \u2013 as your question goes, you've seen it move down in geographies in which you've had, essentially last six to eight weeks has been shutoff in a lot of ways. So not enough of a trend on the initial indicators or first movers to say that there's something there. I do think part of what I was getting on earlier is what we've seen in the past. You follow some of the first indicators being inquiries and quest for tours, et cetera. You've seen that kind of lag cases in that kind of 30 to 45 day range. So what we've seen in cases, in fact that there's still very high may make this time a bit different as far as how much time it takes to post it, but just thinking about it a mid-January kind of peak in cases, you would likely \u2013 if things continue on this trend, the positive trend we're seeing, I think you've start to see towards the middle or the end of the month, maybe some of those first indicators move in a more portfolio wide basis. And so we can provide some more color on that as we update the market over the next month or two, but right now it's too early to speak to it. Yes. I appreciate the question. To clarify that a bit, we're saying if the trends were to continue and I think you're saying the same, you would start to see some improvement in latter part of the quarter. But trends getting better from here or staying the same as the part that we're not taking a position on. And so certainly if that continues that way, that's when we start to see some improvement, our guidance doesn't take a position on COVID in the path of it. It's even today despite where we've come off of. Case counts in every way, shape or form are higher than any point we've given a forward look in the past nine months. So today still there is a lot of uncertainty. It certainly feels better than it did three or four weeks ago. But what's baked into guidance in our view is not an attempt to call for a better or a continued improvement and it's more of a current state holding."

            "content": "Yes. So just to give some stats, the relationships the operators have with CVS and Walgreens has worked quite positively. We've seen over 120,000 vaccinations across the platform as of earlier this week. About 90% of our communities have completed their first clinic and very actively working through the second clinic we feel by the end of February, 1st week of March. Most, if not all of the second clinics will have taken place. With regards to adoption and consent, 90 plus percent of residents have consent or receive the vaccination, 55% of staff across the portfolio that varies from operator-to-operator have consented to receive the vaccination. We're not going to get into specifics on number of vaccines by individuals. Some of this is skewed. You maybe aware that if there was active COVID or inactive COVID diagnosis in the prior 28 days, an individual has to wait to delay that. So we're focusing really on consent and the percentage of vaccinations that have occurred across the communities. But what happened to provide additional color, but those are the highlights."

            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. In the suite of this year-end call, I would like to review year 2020, the most challenging in our history and discuss different paths of growth, long-term value creation for our continuing shareholders on par share basis. We came into 2020 prepared for perhaps a plain-vanilla business cycle downturn. We pushed out our maturities in Q4 of 2019, sold a lot of short duration assets, bought a lot of longer duration assets, and continued to upgrade our portfolio, operators, management contract, and talent. We are hopeful that with the continued decline in senior housing deliveries and starts on one hand and the ageing of the population finally picking up on the other hand that 2020 would serve an inflection point for the fundamentals after decades of weak demographics resulting from the ageing of the baby-boomer generation. Then, the once-a-century pandemic happened that would turn out to be particularly devastating for our business. The back half of first quarter, the second and third quarters were all about long-term value preservation. We enhanced our liquidity profile dramatically by selling assets in record time at or near pre-COVID pricing, more importantly avoided mistakes of raising long-term dilutive capital, a consistent theme for managing the company for continuing shareholder on a par share basis. We started during the dark days of March and April by selling $1 billion of assets at great prices in record 43 days from signing a confidentiality agreement to receiving cash. We continued this journey during Q2 and Q3 and eventually executed on $3.7 billion of disposition at extraordinary prices to build an unprecedented war chest. Two things particularly surprised me during these times. The resilience of our team including our extended team of operating partners and the liquidity of our assets. Not that we didn't have doubts or failures, but we continued to move forward in spite of them with a steady hand on the wheel and an unwavering belief that we'll get to the other side. Our team's stoic resilience reminded me every day of Winston Churchill's famous quote, that \u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not final, it is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d In those moments of reckoning, I realized how privileged I was to be part of this team that didn't miss a beat and blazed new trail. For years, I have heard that healthcare-oriented real estate deserves a discount for the \u2013 to say, a shiny tower in middle of a large gateway city due to the lack of liquidity and smaller ticket size, especially during down cycles. I hope that during the worst down cycle of our asset class, this debate has been finally settled as demonstrated by our execution and that of our colleagues that helped [indiscernible]. In the fall, we pivoted again from defense to offense as we started underwriting and shaking hands on new acquisitions. It is important for you to understand that we don't shake hands and find excuses to walk or chip away, which if we shake hands, we close. Our handshake in this business is worth gold, and we only enhanced our long-term reputation during this pandemic. During last quarter's call, I discussed $1 billion of deep value opportunity. I am delighted to report that we have closed roughly $700 million of acquisitions since the start of fourth quarter at a significant discount to replacement cost. Our acquisition pipeline has grown meaningfully, and as I sit here today, I am optimistic this year is shaping up to be a year of net acquisition, perhaps significantly so. At the same time, I will remind you that we are not driven and incentivized by volume of acquisition, but the value of it. Asset price is the ultimate determinant of how we'll behave. In this moment of confusion and ambiguity, I indulge you to focus on four distinct pillars of long-term value creation for Welltower. One, operating fundamentals. Tim will get into the details of what happened last quarter and what might happen next quarter. While operating fundamentals is awful right now with little near-term visibility, we are optimistic about the vaccine rollout as 90% of our assisted living and memory care facilities have conducted their first vaccination clinic with virtually all residents taking the shot. While I would not expect this to be a source of value creation in the very near term, I'm hopeful about the second half of the year. Normalization of operating performance remains the largest source of value creation for our shareholders. It is too early to comment on exact timing of the trough and the shape of the recovery, but we'll keep you posted frequently intra-quarter so that you can see what we see. Our focus remains on upholding the reputation of our communities and maintaining the safety of our operator staff and residents. We spared no expenses and have already spent in excess of $80 million on COVID-related expenses to-date doing everything we can within our control to support their wellbeing. Due to the great reputation of our operators and the extraordinary value they provide, rates are holding up. In 2020, REVPOR was up 2% in AL memory care, 1% in independent living, and 4.4% in our seniors' apartment business. This growth occurred despite the headwinds resulting from lower community fees driven by a decline in move-in activity. Number two, operator platform enhancement, management contracts, leadership and system enhancements, and building local scale are some of the examples of this. Let me highlight two specifics here. A) Sunrise, we are delighted by the appointment of Jack Callison as the CEO of Sunrise Living, our largest operating partner. Jack will bring much needed attention to operating excellence with an operations-first culture. We are also negotiating a new management contract that will align the interest of Sunrise and Welltower as the owner of the assets. We are diligently working with the management of Revera, Sunrise's majority owner to enhance Sunrise's position so that it can emerge from this pandemic as the leading operator of poised for excellence and growth. B) Building local scale. If I can quote Charlie Munger, the advantage of local scale are of ungodly [ph] importance to this business. We have and we will continue to scale our most important strategic partners as we expand our senior housing footprint. To name a few in alphabetical order, Balfour, Brandywine, Clover, Cojir, Frontier, Kelsey-Seybold, Kisco, Oakmont, StoryPoint are just some of the examples of the partners we have grown significantly during this pandemic. What is common amongst them? They are excellent operators in their market. They have great leadership. They are disciplined. Yes, courageous, and they have an aligned relationship with Welltower. We rise and fall together. This list is expanding with our significant opportunity set that I mentioned few moments ago. Number three, capital deployment opportunity. I have already commented on the acquisition opportunity on the deep value side. As a risk of sounding like a broken record, I would remind you that we are an IRR buyer with an incredible focus on basis, operators and structure. Our opportunity set is rising rapidly and I hope to provide you with more specific color in next 60 to 90 days. This comment is obviously focused on the current opportunities. Let me provide you with some color on a related topic, but on future opportunities. We at Welltower, has never been in a more advantageous position as a partner of choice. For years, we have focused on growth strategy driven by our relationship-based and alignment-focused structures and data analytics platform rather than prioritize on costs and access to capital advantage. After all, not all capital is equal. We never imagined that we've encountered today's extreme stress, but as you can see, we stood by our operators during this difficult time not only to preserve their businesses, but also to grow it significantly. Talk is cheap, but action is not. For this reason, we are inundated with requests as a partner of choice from all asset classes we play in. As much as they like do call, we have been on roads throughout this pandemic meeting with prospective partners. This is very meaningful truths. We have executed more partnership and pipeline deals in next nine months then over five proceeding years combined. We expect to deploy $10-plus billion of capital in these opportunities in next few years. In other words, we are not only executing on deep value early cycle opportunities, but also laying a strong foundation of growth through the entire cycle when inevitably the significant price discrepancies of today will be gone. To give you an example, we recently reupped our master development agreement for five years with Kelsey-Seybold, our largest MOB tenant. We are looking to start approximately 600,000 square feet, 100% pre-leased development in 2021 and 2022. Number four, talent opportunity. I touched on this last call, but let me elaborate for those of you who are focused on long-term. We are seeing an incredible interest in our platform from seasoned professionals to early career applicants. We have taken advantage of recent disruption and brought in 41 new professionals in 2020. We expect at least as many, if not more to join our team in 2021. In addition to new talent, our existing talent pool is taking on more responsibilities in reaching new heights. As a result, we had 50 new promotions at Welltower. Though this puts out early pressure on G&A, which is partially offset by lower executive comp, we think this incredible talent pool is equivalent of a cold spring, which will manifest itself in a meaningful growth for the farm. Speaking of talent pool, how is the mood inside today inside Welltower. What I described to you as a stoic resilience last year has transformed into an environment of optimism and unbridled passion this year. I want to make it abundantly clear. We have no crystal ball about the near-term operating fundamentals, but we are doing meaningful work that matters we have meaningful relationship and we are seeing a new level of positive energy of people who wants to be part of this team internally and externally to create meaningful value and make a disproportionate impact. With that, I'll pass it over the microphone to Tim. Tim? Thank you, Tim. I want to end with two things before we open it up for questions. First, I'm excited about the collaboration that is the March between our peers and us. We have worked diligently with healthy Ventas and Omega to address operator and industry issues and towards mutually beneficial transactions. For example, it was an absolute pleasure to work with Tom DeRosa and his team on two separate transactions, totaling $170 million. I'm positive we are embarking on a new era of collaboration amongst the public companies in our space. Second, in spite of our talent is being faced by our industry today, our confidence in our business has not changed, and I'm hopeful that my comments this morning have provided you with a framework for how we intend to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. We are grateful to be part of your portfolio as our shareholders. Personally, this management team has established a highly concentrated position in Welltower. In fact, neither Tim nor I have sold a single share of the stock that we have received on a post-tax basis since we have come on board few years ago, which should be an indication to you our fellow shareholders of our conviction and personal stake we have in this business. As Buffet taught us, diversification may preserve wealth, but concentration builds wealth. This does not mean the path forward will be without challenges, but it is clear that we are all in on this company and that our alignment with you, our shareholder is strong and significant. With that, we'll open the call up for questions. Thank you, Juan. Good morning. That is, our focus is to buy near-term \u2013 at least in the near-term basis value opportunities that are significant discount replacement costs where we can bring in the right operators or buy with the right operators if it is owned by some other capital partners of our operators. So we're focused on basis, we're focused on operator, we're focused on structure. Interestingly, we're starting to see some opportunities where the initial yield is not as much of a drag. That's just a coincidence. We're not focused on that. We're focused very much on basis, structure, and operators. And I expect that our blended yield of the opportunities when we talk about next quarter will actually be dragged up overall by this set of opportunities. But I can tell you that is not our focus. We're purely focused on basics, structure, and operator. Juan, it is purely dependent on the shape of the recovery and when it drops, which I already said that I'm not going to comment on, right. It is a very uncertain environment. That is precisely why we're buying these value opportunities so that we don't have to be dependent on that, right. So if we had a perfect sense of what the shape of the curve looks like and when it perfectly troughs, then we will be buying everything we possibly can, which we are not. We're very focused on a significant discount/replacement cost for that very reason. But again, we need more time to give you a general sense of what that looks like, but it depends on assets to assets. We're buying assets that are 82% occupied. We're buying assets that are 22% occupied. So, it's very hard to make a general comment on when, what we think that sort of the shape of that acquisition [ph]looks like. So Connor, the conversation with all tenants is the same, right. If a tenant wants to focus on what is the right \u2013 near-term fundamentals right now, and project that as the future, then I don't think that's our right tenant, right. I mean, we have to \u2013 you cannot think about this business as what is happening right now and Mark \u2013 at least to market on that basis on today's fundamental. That's just not how we think about it. I laid out the whole framework of how we think about leases in a previous call. I'm not going to bore you with the details, but the conversations are always the same. What is the normalized cash flow of a business? What does that mean from a value as well as the last dollar basis of that lease? The leverage in fact, right? So that's how we think about leases. That's all we do leases, new leases, renewal leases, and that's all going to move forward. If we think that our tenants and us, we can't agree on what is the long-term value of our real estate is. Then we have to move forward with a different operator. Our value is in the real estate and we know how to preserve it. Jordan, does not mean that we're underwriting in this April to sort of the early summer to late fall leasing season, we're going to see that kind of occupancy increase. If we did that, we would buy every product that we can possibly buy in the market. So I want to remind you that we are not \u2013 we're focused on basis so that our value creation is not dependent on our ability to pinpoint the shape of the recovery. It is purely depended on what it takes to build a building. And if you can buy at a significant discount, the two things will happen, right. You can wait for the demand to come back. And if you can make money at a \u2013 obviously at a 50% to 60% discount replacement costs, then no one will build a new building, add the replacement costs because they have to charge a lot more than you. So ultimately in any capital heavy asset class like real estate, assuming your overall demand is increasing, ultimately the demand supply is well-balanced. If I can make money at discount replacement costs, you will not be able to make money by building a new one at replacement cost. This is particularly interesting phenomenon in this cycle. In most cycles, what you see is replacement cost, I mean, the cost to build goes down whenever recession hits because housing is [indiscernible], replacement cost is actually spiking through this particular cycle that keeps even a bigger gap as we think through a cycle. Okay. Let me take the second one first because that's a easy one. I don't believe that I've ever been critical of our peer companies. What led to the collaboration is that I reached out to my fellow CEOs, and we absolutely agreed that we need to work on this industry issues and operator issues together. And I got a very warm reception. So that's just very simple, right? I mean, it is true that we have to work on this and there is a power in bigger numbers and we have very smart companies in our space run by very confident and smart management team. It is only in our interest to work together to solve these bigger issues than work alone. So that's a simple one. I'm not going to get into the first question. I will tell you that we are creating, as I said, we're very much focused on from an acquisition side on two things, right? Early cycle opportunities that obviously we're executing and you'll be very pleased as the year progress where that will shake out, but we're very much cognizant of the fact that early cycle opportunities, eventually that will be gone. So if we start working on, then what will eventually become is the normal cycle opportunities to late. So we have never stopped. And it is also pretty much to be a very advantageous position to be a large company in our space \u2013 the largest company in our space, which we're expanding pretty rapidly and we didn't bat an eyelid and stopped. And because we believe in the business as I laid out, we are \u2013 you have to think about it.  This is a very interesting business where you have to work with other people and you have to work with operators. You have to work with developers. In many cases they are one and the same and to go create value together, not at the expense of each other. That alignment is extremely important. And this life nine, 10 months has given us the opportunity to work with more of our operators. And frankly speaking, as you can see, being aligned with Welltower, has created significant and is continued to create significant value for our operators who \u2013 if you think about if you're not aligned with an capital source that has the capability and the fierce resolve to deploy capital to this kind of disruption, then ultimately, as I said, you come to the other end of the cycle and it's too late. So I'm not going to get into what that looks like. I'll just give you one example, 600,000 square feet of 100% pre-leased MOBs, Michael, you can do the math and think about how much value creation. And that is not a pipeline that is just a start that we're sitting here today between 2021 and 2022. Thank you, Jonathan. It depends \u2013 obviously every asset is different where you buy the asset, what basis you buy the asset is completely different. When we made that presentation, we never thought we'll be able to buy assets at \u2013 and meaningful discount replacement costs. If we look at pre-pandemic, healthcare real estate, particularly on the senior housing, usually traded at a mild to modest premium to replacement costs because the healthcare income has a multiple, not a real estate multiple, but it's still a multiple, right? So in asset class where you're starting above some level of replacement costs, you're going to keep your pricing power really strong through the whole cycle. And the next buyer analysis, you have to think about your next buyer analysis. And the next buyer has to also believe that we'll continue. That by implication, you are buying above replacement costs and you are selling above replacement costs or you were making a bet that the NOI growth, if you're \u2013 NOI growth will meaningfully outstrip the cost of construction increase, right? So in both sides, you are at some form of above replacement costs. That equation changes completely when you can buy at a significant discount replacement costs. So if you buy $0.50 on the $1 and at some period of normalization, you sell it at 100 cents on the $1. You are still at a significant discount to the previous case, when your next buyers' analysis it's much, much easier. Nothing has changed except the price and that price tells you why we're so excited about it today. Okay. So this is a question that I don't want to be too long-winded and give you an answer. It depends on the price \u2013 really the service level of the assets inside those buildings today. And we don't increase occupancy our operating partners do. And we work with our operating partners on service levels CapEx needed and everything, but this is a collaborative process. And I don't want to sort of sit here and tell you that this is \u2013 we have the operating expertise to do that. I'm assuming you're asking a SHOP question. We have the best operators in the business that are very, very good of what they do and their local dominance in the marketplace, obviously, as well as this particular service area is very much of what we are depending on. Having said that, we have worked diligently with our operators on payers and provider integration, and as I said, this is a very long answer to a question. We're happy to take this offline. And have you talked too much ever \u2013 obviously this process in our SHOP, but the pricing question, the service question is more of an operator question than a Welltower question, CapEx question is definitely something that we work together. Having said that the payer and provider integration is something that we're leading and our operators are collaborating with us, but that's a long discussion. And we'll take this up offline if this is of interest to you. Rich, I would just add two things. One is that, we obviously \u2013 I would encourage you and our team would be happy to set it up to talk to Mark Shaver in our team with what we're doing on the payer provider side, and which should help margin as well. The second lessons learned, I would say not a margin point, but the separate point is one of the lessons learned in our SHOP through not just this pandemic, but through last few years, is that you should not lend money to an entity or any type of entity where you are not willing to take the keys, right. As of REIT, we're not allowed to obviously own an operating company more than 35%. So we should not lend money to operating companies where we're not able to take over the assets. Today, we're only focused \u2013 obviously in the last few years, and through the cycle, through the pandemic, we're only focused on if we write a credit check, we only write, if we are completely able to take over the assets and we're very happy owner of the assets on the last dollar exposure that we have. That is a big lessons learned inside our SHOP and a good one for the long-term value creation of our shareholders. Nick, I'll answer the second question and Mark will answer the first question. We have tremendous amount of respect for John Moore and his team at Atria. We do not comment on the vaccine policy of different operators. We work with our operators and supportive of their different policies. I can tell you everybody's focus is to get to the right place. How they get there is the decisions that the management teams and the CEOs of specific operators to take that. We do not push for one or the other, but I can tell you that everybody is focused on the same outcome. Mark? Our target yields Mike have not changed. Market conditions have changed, so obviously or even more critically thinking about the cost as well as the land price and ultimately how much it takes to \u2013 obviously how long it takes to get to that stabilization and the working capital loss in between, right. So our focus, again, as I've said, you have to imagine these things. They're long-term. We think about at least the developments that we're interested in. You're talking about a five, six-year cycles, so you have to really, really think hard about when do you start, when it actually finishes, when you get your approval. And just for an example, as you know that for last few months or last year or so, we have worked on in new development project in Brooklyn. It is one of the hardest place to build in the country, right. You can't change your view depending on how you're feeling about your occupancy today. That's a five to seven year process. And so our return thresholds have not changed. Clearly, what we think sort of the trended yields, the trending has changed given what is going on in the business today, and we still need to make money on an untrended basis to start this development. So that's how we're thinking about it. So Todd, we have the ability to tell you today. First is that not just focused on senior housing the team has built. The platform has been enhanced pretty meaningfully in last few quarters, so we have the ability. We're beyond what you have seen in senior housing into medical office and other housing businesses such as active adult, where you play pretty heavily. One of the questions that you raised, which is the migration pattern, you can do. We have a team \u2013 entire team, which has been working on this data scientist. Today, I'm glad to tell you that we have the ability to pinpoint that out migration or in migration on a weekly basis, not just focused on the longer-term data such as ACS and IRS data, but also cellphone data and other more near-term or more instantaneous sort of data. I don't mean instantaneous in right at this point, but we can tell you most on a weekly basis \u2013 not almost on a weekly basis, we can tell you on a weekly basis where people have moved out or moved in. That is very much flowing we're through models as we're making investments. As you know, that we're very, very focused on making new investments on all the asset classes we deal in. And it's definitely a big part of why we're seeing today the attractiveness of us as the capital has enhanced in last few months or few quarters because we're still standing here and taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace, but also that huge predictive analytics platform that we have built over many years that our partners are attracted to. Well, I think you just coined a new time. I'm assuming you're asking about the difference between senior housing triple-net versus senior housing operating. So look, given where the cycle is, I want to be a majority being the equity position are in the RIDEA side. But there are opportunities to deploy capital in the senior housing in a triple-net side. If you have assets that are stabilized and you can buy it cheap enough that the last dollar of that lease is still in a place where the operators can make money and we can make money. Obviously, you can create a lot of bells and whistles than what the operators have the second bite of the Apple. So there's ways you can create that alignment, but remember, if you simplistically think about RIDEA is an equity exposure and at least it's more of a credit exposure, you can create value if a) from our side, if the buildings are stabilized or near stabilization and you buy it cheap enough that your last dollar is still a pretty low rent relative to what the cash flow of the buildings look like then you can create value, but that's how we think about it. That's how our operators think about it. And so we have found two opportunities to do leases. If we do find more opportunities, we'll do it, but I can tell you that the industry is moving away, at least we're moving away from very tightly covered leases. Today, we're thinking about there should be even more margin of safety, and when we find opportunities where we're buying so cheap that we can that's when we're going for it. Pretty much across the Board, I mean, if you think about it, we have added a lot of people on our investment teams and we have hired a lot of people on that data analytics team, we hired a lot of \u2013 hiring people on our infrastructure teams or accounting, tax. I don't have the background. I can tell you that we have seen an incredible resurgence of interest in our asset in our company today from both sort of externally and internally. And what I mean externally as an operator, as developers, internally as prospective employees. Both experienced employees that we're hiring there's a lot of talent in the market for obvious disruption. Also a lot of early career employees that we're seeing. I'll just tell you just one small stat. Interesting one, doesn't change really when we do. We hire \u2013 East Coast, West Coast and Midwest, we hire the top seven schools for MBA candidates. This year, we got more than 1,400 applications for really four or five positions we hire. So that sort of tells you the interest in our business and the amount of incredible talent we're seeing both on the early career side as well as super experienced side, and we'll see some really good hires this year as well. This year, I expect that we'll add 40 to 50 professionals across the Board in the company. Acquisition is not just as I said, I want you to think about, Josh, acquisition in this kind of market, which is so disruptive in three ways. One, obvious one, right, we're doing value opportunities that we can add, edit discount replacement costs; b) acquisition of partnership and operator relationship and developer relationship, that's B; c) is employees. We're in a business of talent and given the amount of disruption that's in the marketplace that we see and what we think this business will become as we think about three years, five years, 10 years from now. We're very much adding an incredible level of talent that we have sort of never seen in the marketplace. So let me take your question and see what I can get there. I'm not going to comment on sort of what might happen. There's too much uncertainty. We have a new administration. If I sit here and try to comment on what might happen, I'll be so much outside my zone of confidence, which I think, you know, that I focus very much on talking about confidence. Being a lifelong Buffett and Munger, sort of decide, I'm not going to answer that. But I will tell you that Tom is doing well. I talk to him pretty frequently. He has been an incredible mentor and a friend. He continues to help me think through a lot of issues and he's definitely doing well. If you reach out to him, he will reply to you, but he's definitely doing well and he remains safe, great supporter of the company and he's helping any way he can. Like beauty, distress is also something that lies in the eyes of the beholder. I can tell you Dan, we're buying assets in core markets of New Jersey, Seattle, California for less than $200,000 a unit where replacement cost is $400,000, $500,000 above $500,000 a unit. If you don't think that's a deep value opportunity, I really don't know how to answer to that. So I guess, we just have to obviously think about it different way. We are \u2013 if you just always remember price relative to what it takes to build that gap is what we've distressed. If you just want to look at purely on a price per pound and does it look cheap, just wait for a few, as I said, 60 to 90 days, I can tell you more about some of those opportunities that we're seeing. But I think we're executing on some very significant sort of discount replacement cost opportunities, some we have reported. And if you look at what those assets are and dig into what it takes to build it, you will understand that. So going back to the banks, look, I have no idea when the banks will obviously push more towards \u2013 sort of pushing these sort of these whole pipeline of new construction that happened between 2015 and 2019 from their books. But I can tell you that we have been working diligently with many of our banking partners. Just yesterday we executed on one such loan. Look, we're here open for business. We have a sense of what the value is. We have a sense of how we can create value, not just at the buy, but also with our operating partners and we're executing. But I can't sit here and tell you when the banks will pick the books. That's just no way to say that. Also Tayo, as Tim sort of pointed out before majority of the decline is on an average basis is already baked in, right. So if you see the improvement that you are hoping for, which we're not hoping for, we're not guiding for then that will more impact the second quarter than the first quarter."

At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded [Operator instructions]. I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatt McQueen: Thank you and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call maybe deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these difficult times. Before I get into the accomplishment for the quarter and discuss our capital allocation strategy, let me make some comments on leadership changes and strategy going forward for Welltower. Let me start with our outgoing CEO, my close friend and mentor, Tom DeRosa. Tom's impact on our industry, our company and me can never be overstated. He was a visionary who saw the need of integrating senior housing into healthcare continuum years before COVID and now we all know the importance of that today and going forward. He was a successful entrepreneur -- he took a successful entrepreneurial company and made it a process driven institutional company that attracted an incredible caliber of talent. And last but not the least, his contribution on me personally and my career can never be overemphasized. He has been a terrific boss, a great mentor and a close friend. He continues to help me even today and guide me in as necessary. We wish Tom the very best in his retirement. I'm also pleased to announce that Phil Hawkins one of the most well respected ex-CEOs of the REIT space has joined our board. We're looking forward to Phil's guidance and mentorship for many years to come. And finally, I'm thrilled to be working with a new independent Chairman of the Board, Ken Bacon, with a strong track record of leadership and experience, both in real estate and finance. Ken, will lead our board and partner with me and our leadership team as we execute our company strategy. As far as our team is concerned, the company has never been in a better place. There are about 20 women and men who are leading this company forward every day. I cannot be more proud of this team. In the coming weeks and months, you will see a series of promotions and new roles that will consolidate the leadership of this company, not a change per se, just a recognition of the exceptional work that the team is doing. Our team has never been busier and more excited to create once in a lifetime value for our owners. Many of you have asked me if our strategy will change going forward. The answer to that question is an emphatic no. Welltower will continue to strive to be the premier wellness infrastructure company that allocates capital in the path of growth of healthcare and wellness trends. You're not going to get any grand strategic pronouncement from me. We\u2019ll continue to focus on creating value for our partners and our employees, if they create significant value for our owners. And the partners and employees will be able to create long term sustainable value, only if their end customers are happy. It is that simple. We do not need to complicate a simple idea. We need to continue to execute and deliver superior cash flow growth on a per share basis. To paraphrase one of my favorite CEOs of all time, Tom Murphy, the goal is not to have the longest wait but we arrive at the station first using the least amount of wealth. We will continue to be vigilant as ever that institutional imperative do not fit into our culture and we remain focused on efficiency of the platform, data driven decision making and employee satisfaction. Given it is my first call as CEO, I lay out a simple capital allocation framework for you. A company effectively has four choices of raising capital; capping internal cash flow, issuing debt, issuing equity and disposition of its existing assets. It also has five essential choices of deploying that capital; investing in existing assets, acquisitions, paying down debt, paying dividends and buying back stock. You can loosely call the first set of choices as selling, but right description of that would be sourcing or raising capital. You can loosely call the second set of choices as buying, but the client description would be deployment of capital. Following the same line of thinking, loosely speaking, consistent buying low and selling high creates value for our shareholders in a more wholesome and thoughtful description, pptimizing these choices from this menu of sources and uses in a tax efficient manner creates value for continuing shareholder on per share basis. The goal is to maximize cash flow and value per share, not to become the biggest or the most revolutionary. We at Welltower do not spend a second strategizing on how to win the popularity contest on Wall Street. In fact, as stated in the past, we focused on buying assets when they're out of favor that is unpopular at the right price in the right structure. Ultimately, this capital deployment strategy allows for outsized return with a large margin of safety. Price, not exposure, is the ultimate mitigant of risk. We are constantly striving to create value and trust you as our shareholders will reward the companies that create true intrinsic value over long term. If you allow me to continue this theme of sourcing and deployment of capital, let's look at what we have achieved in Q3 and post quarter close. We are delighted to inform you that we have executed on two large senior housing transactions at a valuation significant in excess of $400,000 units in the mid 3% cap rate on current NOI and around 5% cap rate on pre COVID NOI. These transactions with our Invesco joint venture on MOBs puts us in an enviable position of balance sheet strength. We currently have $5.2 billion of liquidity and $2.2 billion of cash, which is expected to rise further as the quarter progresses. We at Welltower do not see balance sheet as a matter of vanity like vintage cars, but the most important countercyclical tool to create value at the cycle lows and avoid the need of raising dilutive capital at exactly the wrong time in the cycle. That gets us to our menu of capital deployment to particular interest investing in hard assets and doubling down on the assets that we already own through buying back our own stock. In matter of any acquisitions as is with stocks patients is a virtue with occasional boldness, and we think that moment of occasional boldness is finally here. We have in excess of $1 billion of acquisition in our pipeline comprised of 6,500-plus units at an average price of $165,000 unit at a material discount to replacement cost. 17 deals in the pipeline represents a wide range of transactions from $10 million redevelopment asset to $188 million core portfolio of brand-new assets. We have identified many of these assets working with our existing partners through our data analytics platform or who are buying out other capital partner of our existing operators. The pipeline's initial yield is at low 4s but we believe it will stabilize in the high single-digit to low double-digit yields. As is a very short term but incorrect way to look at this will be, we're deploying capital in the low 4% trends and sourcing that capital in the mid 3% range. We believe the correct way to look at this will be that we are sourcing that capital in the mid single digit unlevered IRR and deploying at a low double digit unlevered IRR, as evidenced by sourcing the capital in the 400,000 plus per unit level and deploying that capital at $165,000 per unit level. Despite our weak cost of public capital, this rate has never been wider and hence the opportunity to create generational value for our owners on a per share basis. And that completes the look for you and explains why our team is so excited and so busy. We believe we are making real impact and anticipate creating exceptional value. We not only see this environment as an opportunity for smart capital allocation in the financial realm, but also in the human capital area. We are seeing availability of superior talent in the marketplace today and we're bouncing on this opportunity as we are on the investment side. With that, I will hand the mic over to Tim, who will walk you through the operational and financial results for the quarter. I will come back to make some additional comments on the operating environment after him. Tim?\nTim McHugh: Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on the third quarter 2020 results and performance of all property segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet liquidity update. In the third quarter, Welltower reported normalized FFO of $0.84 per diluted share, a $0.02 decline from second quarter, driven by $0.03 of dilution from dispositions completed in Q2 and Q3, a $0.01 negative impact from changes in revenue recognition in our post-acute senior housing triple net portfolios and a slight decline in sequential senior housing operating performance. Those items were offset by tighter cost controls at corporate and reduction in COVID-related expenses in our senior housing operating portfolio. As a reminder, on the dilution type dispositions, we had $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, inclusive 10/31 deposits as of 9/30. Now turning to our individual property segments. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple net lease portfolio covered an occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30/2020 and therefore, only reflect a partial impact on COVID-19. Across all triple net lease segments, Welltower collected 98% of contractual rent due in the third quarter. Now starting with our senior housing triple net portfolio. Same-store NOIs declined 10 basis points year-over-year and higher bad debt accrual and a tough comp drove growth slightly negative. The combined FFO impact of revenue recognition changes on one restructured lease in the quarter was $0.05 relative to 2Q and expected to grow to a full penny in 4Q., i.e., another half penny impact sequentially from 3Q to 4Q. Occupancy was down 390 basis points sequentially and EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.02x on a sequential basis to 1.02. Consistent with my comments in the past, our senior housing triple-net operators experienced the same headwind server day operators over the past seven months, and we expect reported lease coverage starts stats to continue to reflect these challenges and more of the pandemic periods reflected EBITDAR going forward. In the quarter, we also transitioned five of a planned nine properties from Capital Senior to StoryPoint Senior Living and expect the other four properties to transition by the end of the year. This is the first phase of the transition agreement we entered into with Capital Senior at beginning of the year, which allowed for an early termination of CSUs leases on 24 Welltower owned assets in exchange for full year 2020 rent being paid in cooperation with transitioning the operations. Despite the challenging environment, our team and our operators have been able to organize and execute transition plans with StoryPoint transitions as well as the remaining 15 properties CSU currently operates, which will be transitioned to three of our existing RIDEA operators in the fourth quarter. As a result of the COVID backdrop, the initial expected dilution from the conversion is expected to be approximately $12 million or $0.03 per share in 2021 relative to rent recognized in 2020. As a reminder, since our capital senior rent continues to be paid, the leases on these assets that have yet to be transitioned are reflected on our payment coverage stratification presentation on Page 7 of our supplement and make up roughly three fourths of the triple-net senior housing rent that is less than 0.85x covered by EBITDA. Although the last seven months have been very challenging for the senior housing triple operators, the sequential stabilization we observed between the second and third quarter, along with relief funds from HHS we received in the fourth quarter, should help our operators find their footing heading into 2021. Turning to long term post acute portfolio. We generated positive 2% year-over-year same store growth and EBITDAR coverage decline by 0.1x sequentially. As noted in our business update earlier this month and in last night's release, Genesis Healthcare, which makes up approximately half of our long term post acute segment exposure, includes language in the second quarter financials filed on August 10th regarding its ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of this, Welltower began recording Genesis lease revenue on a cash basis in the third quarter, retroactive to July 1st. This had a negative $2.2 million impact or approximately half of penny FFO per share relative to second quarter 2020. This also resulted in writedown of $97 million of straight line rent receivables. Genesis continues to remain current on all financial obligations to Welltower through October. And lastly, within our triple net lease segments, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System. NOI growth was positive 2.3% year-over-year, driven by 2.75% increase during August and trailing 12 month EBITDAR coverage was 2.61 times. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical portfolio delivered positive 1% same store growth. This below trend growth was driven mainly by increased bad debt reserve, majority of which related to lease enforcement moratoriums in several California jurisdictions, which we have a sizable footprint. As these moratoriums expire, we spent rent collection to further improve. We continue to see signs across our outpatient portfolio that activities returned to pre COVID levels, evidenced by the number of tenant work order requests received, our tenant's own volume data and park income in our properties. In the quarter, park income was still a slight headwind year-over-year, but its negative contribution to NOI growth decreased to 10 basis points this quarter versus 70 basis points in the second quarter. During the quarter, we collected approximately 97% of contractual rents and had an additional 2% of rents deferred, the majority of which are located in the aforementioned jurisdictions with lease enforcement moratoriums. We also continue to have very strong rent collection and deferral plans we put in place in April, May and June. Since we started collecting on these plans in June, we've experienced 99.5% collection rates through September. As a reminder, the large majority of our second quarter deferral plans were structured to pay back entirely by year-end. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before reviewing this quarter's senior housing operating portfolio results, I want to briefly summarize the outlook we provided back in us. At that time, our expectations for the third quarter was that occupancy would be down between 125 and 175 basis points from July 1st through September 30th. And that REVPOR and total expenses would be flat sequentially. We ended the quarter with occupancy down 150 basis points start to finish. REVPOR was down 40 basis points, and expenses were down 3.4%. Turning to results in the quarter. Same store NOI decreased 27.3% as compared to the third quarter of 2019, driven largely by 680 basis point year-over-year drop in average occupancy. As we indicated last quarter, two factors drove this outsized decline in occupancy. First, the portfolio began the third quarter at significantly lower level of occupancy, following the steep drop experienced in the second quarter and continued to decline during the quarter, albeit at a significantly decelerated pace from 2Q. And secondly, we experienced a seasonal increase in occupancy in the third quarter of 2019, creating tougher sequential comp. REVPOR for the quarter was down 1% year-over-year, but I want to provide a bit more color here. The next shift is distorting the use of this metric as a proxy for rate growth. Over the last two quarters, our lower acuity properties, active adult independent living, have held up considerably better on the occupancy front than our higher acuity buildings. This has driven up the percentage of total portfolio occupied units that are lower acuity and therefore, lower rent paying units. This has had the mathematical effect of averaging down our total portfolio of rent per occupied unit. If you break the portfolio into two buckets, active adult independent living in one and assisted living and memory care in the other, you will see the lower acuity bucket had 20 basis point decrease in REVPOR year-over-year, while the higher acuity bucket had a positive 1.4% year-over-year change. While we are seeing as in some select discounting on room rates in some of our markets, in general, rates continue to be fairly resilient in the face of occupancy declines. And lastly, SHO operating expenses. Same store operating expenses declined 1.1% year-over-year and declined 3.3% sequentially. I'll focus on sequential growth since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. We experienced fairly expected sequential expense trends driven by two main items; lower compensation growth as operators adjusted their staffing to lower occupancy levels and lower COVID expenses as same- tore COVID expenses decreased from $33 million to $50 million sequentially, driven by lower emergency staffing costs and significant reductions in price per unit cost of PPE. We expect COVID-related costs to continue to decrease in the fourth quarter, but at a much lower pace than in 3Q. Looking forward to the fourth quarter and starting with October data we've already observed, we've experienced a 30 basis point decline in occupancy to the week of October 23rd. And we expect to finish the fourth quarter approximately 75 basis points to 125 basis points lower than where we ended the third quarter. We also expect both ROVPAR and total expenses to be flat on a sequential basis. This outlook does not include any impact from HHS funds that maybe received in the fourth quarter. Now on to capital markets activity. In July, we completed the successful tender of $426 million of our 3.75% and 3.95% senior notes due in 2023. Proceeds for the tender were generated from the June issuance of $600 million in senior unsecured notes bearing interest rate of 2.75% with maturity date of January 2031. We used the remaining proceeds to pay down $140 million of our term loan due in 2022. These transactions both derisk near-term maturities through 2023 and increased our unsecured bond borrowings weighted average maturity to 9.2 years. Additionally, in the quarter, we repaid $289 million of secured debt of which $112 million was the fee and subsequently extinguished in October. Moving to investment activity, which was mainly focused on our development pipeline with $96 million invested this quarter. On the disposition front, we completed $1.4 billion of pro rata dispositions at a 5.3 cap rate. Post quarter end, we closed on the previously announced sale of a senior housing operating portfolio for $200 million or $395,000 per unit. The sales price represents a cap rate of 2.6% based on third quarter annualized NOI and a 4.9% cap rate on pre-COVID or March trailing 12-month NOI. Inclusive of this disposition, we completed $3.3 billion dispositions year-to-date at a 5.4% cap rate. We expect to close another $186 million of transactions in the fourth quarter comprised of secondary tranches or [ROPAR] asset sales tied to previously executed outpatient medical transactions. The near-term FFO impact from the completion of these intra and post-quarter dispositions will be approximately $0.03 per share sequentially in the fourth quarter, and will bring cash and cash equivalents to $2.4 billion and total liquidity to $5.4 billion. We believe that the continued ability to execute dispositions of strong pricing supports our view that our private cost of equity capital is substantially better than our public costs at this time. Underlying cash flow continues to be impacted by a challenging backdrop. We ended the quarter at 6.02 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 34 basis point increase from last quarter as a result of liquidity generated successful dispositions in the quarter, which have continued to bolster the balance sheet. Adjusting for EBITDA loss to sales in the quarter and the post quarter end sales just mentioned, run rate net debt to EBITDA is approximately 6.1 times, with $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thanks, Tim. Let me provide you some color on underlying trends of what's happening in the senior housing business. Needless to say that we're very encouraged by the sequential stabilization of NOI in the quarter. I would like to draw your attention to Slide 16 of our deck, which describes a significant sequential improvement of move ins. Last quarter, I talked about the hesitation of customers to move in after they put a deposit on. As communities resumed visitation, we have seen a significant improvement in this area, frankly, which was my biggest concern as described last quarter call. Let's take an example of five very large operators, which constitute of national operators, large regional operators in Northeast, West Coast and Sunbelt, a pretty diverse group. The average delay between deposit to move in during October of last year was 19 days. In March of this year, it was 17 days, that increased to a whopping 41 days in June. We have seen a meaningful decrease every month in Q3 and finally, it is down to about 18 days in October. We are hearing from our AL focus partners that in many cases this lag is now getting shorter than pre covet days as families can no longer delay the care needs of their loved ones. No question, we're very encouraged by that. However, we are unwilling to project this moving trend as we are in middle of a third wave of COVID across the country. It will be a complete full hurry for us to predict how things will play out in next few weeks and months before the COVID car flattens out again. But the experience of this accelerated move-ins in the pace of move ins tells you that our customers need our product. They moved in as soon as they could. We have no ability to predict when we'll be on the other side of the COVID but we're optimistic when that they finally come, our need-based product will likely to see meaningful traction in demand. What bridges us between now and then is our fortress balance sheet and what creates value between now and then is our ability to allocate capital to make outsized returns for our owners. In this age of Torrens of information, it is sometimes hard to differentiate signals from noise. It is important that we periodically take a step back and remind ourselves that stock is a fractional ownership in a business and not a ticker. As managers of the business we can assure you that our team has never been more energized and excited about creating long term value for our shareholders. With that, we\u2019ll open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Sakwa from Evercore ISI.\nStephen Sakwa: I guess, Shank, going back to Page 16, it's encouraging to see the move-ins. Could you talk maybe a little bit more about leads and kind of where leads are? And I know you spoke a little bit about the time from a lead to a move-in. But just what are you seeing specifically on that timetable as it relates to move-ins?\nShankh Mitra: So Steve, leads has not been a problem even when we were here 90 days ago, leads have come back, not completely to pre COVID level but definitely on a year-over-year basis but sequentially it has. And it is even on a year-over-year basis, it's approaching pre COVID level, maybe 10%, 50% still lower. But we're definitely approaching the amount of leads and the quality leads, more importantly, in the system. The issue has been that you obviously had a very good follow-through of how many people are doing -- either seeing the units, whether virtually or physically and then getting to the deposit. That's what I talked about the pressure on the sort of the front door, if you will. That has not been the issue. The issue has been that the customer was hesitating after that. This is a purely an AL focused comment. We're still seeing hesitation in the IL focused communities where if you don't have a need, you're taking time to make a decision. I mean, with all the noise and then obviously, hopeful good news on vaccines, people are just taking time. I can't tell you why that is the case but on the IL side, people are taking the time. On the AL side, we have faced that pressure on the front door but that was not translating into the move-in, that sale was not translating into the move-in, which we kind of described that. And since we said that, we have seen some clearly significant improvement in that area. So that's what we're seeing in that rapid pace of acceleration in that move-in and that continued even through last week.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi. Mr. Joseph, your line is open. Okay. I show our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: So just want to get in a little bit to the fourth quarter sequential occupancy numbers that you went through. So down 100 basis points versus the third quarter, which is reasonable in a perhaps a seasonal environment, and you can comment on seasonality that would typically impact you. But I'm curious how would 100 basis points compare to your pre-COVID history. Is this a fairly typical change in occupancy, or is it still being impacted in your view by the unique environment we're in?\nTim McHugh: I'll start with that, Rich. It's higher than we usually see. You typically see kind of a 50 basis point decrease over that stretches from 4Q to 1Q, but over a typical seasonality of occupancy, you'll see 50 basis points lost over kind of the fourth quarter and first quarter. So this higher than that. And I think speaking about the seasonality is improvement, because it adds some uncertainty to the number, which is factored in now we're looking at the fourth quarter. We've talked about this a bit, at this point, in some ways, it's a best guy\u2019s hypothesis and that we won't see as much of a seasonal change in demand just due to the disruption we've seen in this demand during the year. And so seasonality, there's two things that drive seasonality. There's change in seasonal demand and there's also the impact of the flu. I think data is very supportive of the flu. At this point won't play a large role in the typical seasonality we see. And on the demand side, we don't necessarily think that the typical demand changes we see will play a role. But the 100 basis points is really just due to the COVID environment, what we've seen so far in the quarter. And certainly, when I say COVID environment, it's really the national picture, the acceleration in cases and it\u2019s that adding a bit of certainty to what the outlook is for the next two, three months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.\nVikram Malhotra: Shankh, congrats on taking the leadership and congrats to the whole team. I know you guys put a lot of hard work. Just maybe building or digging into '16 a little bit, you've seen the acceleration, like you pointed out in the lead conversion that the time lines narrowing. I'm just wondering if you described sort of second or third wave, or hard to categorize now. But can you sort of comment on this decline in timing and the leads in markets where you've really seen a true second and a true third wave versus markets where we're just seeing sort of a new wave. In other words, is this more kind of uniform? Are you seeing real dispersion in markets?\nShankh Mitra: We're actually not seeing a lot of dispersion in markets per se, there's a huge dispersion from a product-type perspective. So you were seeing whether in the West Coast, East Coast or Texas, or you pick your market. If you have a need driven product, the customer's willingness to make a decision is significantly higher. And frankly, we are hearing from some of our partners that, that is even accelerated relative to even pre COVID levels. But in case of where you have a lifestyle-driven product where somebody wants to be in that environment but doesn't have to be, you are still seeing visitation. So it's not a market driven, it is definitely a product driven phenomena.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: So Shankh, congrats again on the CEO role. How do you see your leadership style and approach both similar but also different than Tom? And maybe secondarily, Tom, obviously, was highly visible within the industry and as well as globally going to Davos and other events. I guess how do you see yourself doing that? And is that going to be part of your approach as well as CEO of Welltower?\nShankh Mitra: So I will tell you, look, as you guys know that Tom has trained me for the job over many years and definitely been very influenced by how he saw the world. The first and foremost, he had taught us and that sort of ingrained in my leadership style as well as a lot of other people in our leadership team is to take that what we can do more from this platform, not just think about disparate aggregation of assets but thinking through platform. And the importance of being on the bleeding edge of healthcare and wellness trends and that will continue to happen. I'm very much focused on execution, very much focused on per share value creation. And that's what the team made and capital allocation. So everybody's leadership style is different and I would -- obviously, it is less important on the difference between Tom's leadership style and my leadership style, I will tell you, that it is as collectively as the leadership team, we see our biggest focus today is to increase the value per share execute. And obviously, there's a tremendous amount of potential for us to get back to our lost earnings, not just to the recover level. As you imagine, we have talked about even pre COVID, our portfolio was under leased and get back to that and create that value through execution and capital allocation, and that's what we are focused on today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One.\nDaniel Bernstein: I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the other side of the equation on move-outs and just understand maybe why residents are moving out if you have that information at this point? Is it pent-up move-outs, AL to SNFs that you've seen higher acuity, families taking residence out before the winter, any change in length of stay? Just trying to understand that other side of the equation for move-ins.\nShankh Mitra: Dan, you asked a very interesting question. If you think about move outs, move outs have come down pretty much across the board for over last seven, eight months through COVID. Last couple of weeks, I would say that we have seen some increased move-outs. It's hard to say why that is the case, because it's too short of a time frame to make this as a trend. But it is also the most difficult part of our business to predict. It is all of the above of what you mentioned as reason for move out. We don't see financial reasons for move out in our industry, but we have seen some elevated move-outs for last couple of weeks. We also saw some reduced move outs few weeks before that. This is a very, very hard business to predict on a weekly basis, monthly basis. So I think it is hard for us to sort of get into that and see what the trend and what's not. You could take us for weeks and say the first two weeks is that you wanted to have an optimistic bench, and you could have said that I will take that move-out trends and move-in trends and project, or you could have taken the last two weeks of elevated move out trends and project forward, and there's no right and wrong answer. We have just done the latter part or the first part. But we could be wrong and things can turn out to be better than we thought. But as we sit here today with the uncertainty that we see the overall, the national COVID environment, I think it's prudent for us to, at this point, not to try to get to too excited about what might or might not happen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets.\nQ - Juan Sanabria: I just wanted to follow up with one of your points at the end there where you talked about conversions of people putting down money to actually coming into the cities in that kind of compresses back to kind of pre-COVID levels. Does that mean potentially that once COVID passes that you don't have kind of deferred demand, I guess, particularly on the AL side that would be coming in the door kind of post COVID whenever that may be first or second quarter that's kind of deferred the decision and now is ready to come in if those leads and deposits are converting today?\nShankh Mitra: No, Juan. It simply means that the customers need our product. So what has been going on is with all the national headlines and all the COVID and the overall situations, people are hesitating. Now we obviously have a need that's sort of adding up. And now the customers are saying, well, they can move in, again, we're not projecting that into the future, that's a very important point. If we did then we would not give you the guidance for fourth quarter that we did. But very much with thinking that very simply the customer has moved in when they could. Now if COVID spiked up again and they can because you have visitation bans or you have shutdown of facilities and all of those things, that you will see that. But most importantly, they moved in when they can. I was simply answering the question on the need-driven nature of our product and the secular demand of the product. COVID will eventually be behind us and the demand of the product hasn't changed through this period of time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky from Berenberg.\nConnor Siversky: Just a quick one on testing capacity, among your peers of the last round of earnings, it still seemed like point-of-care test were in short supply. So I'm just wondering how this dynamic has improved at all? And then given some news on the vaccination front, what are the goals in terms of testing if we're taking six or 12 month view?\nShankh Mitra: Connor, we have made a very significant improvement even in last 90 days on point-of-care testing. We tested over 200,000 employees and residents and that continues to progress. We got some very significant improvement, I would say, in the last 45 days in that particular area, a point of -- in the testing side. But it's too premature to say how that will impact the consumer behavior and the ability to move in people. We think it will improve. But again, given the overall uncertain environment, it is too early for us to comment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: I was hoping to get a sense of the legacy RIDEA contracts that were embedded in the SHO dispositions during 3Q, and if the majority were actually legacy structures. I believe heading into 2020, you had 80% of operators converted to what is seemingly a more favorable RIDEA 3.0 contract. And I guess the second part of the question is where would that percentage stand today? Thank you.\nShankh Mitra: I don't have the number percentage for you, but I can tell you that both of -- what was -- the two portfolios were sold, they were not in RIDEA 3.0 contracts. So your fundamental assumption will be correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich from Green Street.\nLukas Hartwich: Just a bit color on [Indiscernible] earlier, that was really helpful. I was hoping you could dive a bit below the surface and describe what you're seeing with base rents versus concessions, things like that?\nShankh Mitra: Lukas, can you repeat please one more time?\nLukas Hartwich: So was curious on the REVPOR front, if you could dive a little bit deeper on what you're seeing with face rents versus concessions? What's kind of driving the headline REVPOR number? I thought the color around the mix shift was helpful. I'm just curious what's going on with face rents and concessions?\nTim McHugh: So I think from the numbers and we're seeing in the market is we're not seeing a lot of evidence of concession. I think as Shank spoke to probably seeing more on the lower acuity side as far as just what we're seeing in the market as far as it\u2019s because of some of the difference in kind of needs-based aspect of it that there is a little bit more of a consumer discretionary goods and therefore, you're seeing a bit more of that, I'd say, in the front end whereas on the assisted living side, you're seeing very little bit. We've talked about this a bit, community fees, which typically align with when you move in and are both kind of cover costs to move in, as well as having testing, et cetera, to get your acuity level of care. So you're seeing some discounting of those. And so we've said the combination of community fees coming through REVPOR is that you have people moving in on a year-over-year basis. So you're seeing kind of community fees in total come down and also you're seeing some discounting. And in assisted living importantly you\u2019re not seeing discounting in care and more of the residents we're seeing coming in, they're coming in because of the care. And so there isn't a lot of price competition there. Reputation is a huge factor. You saw some competition in general in the market to the supply cycle over the last couple of years impact pricing. I'd say in the COVID environment, you're actually seeing a bit of that dissipate because more of the consumer residents are being attracted towards the better brand names and more well-known names in the market. So assisted living pricing is holding up, I'd say, pretty well, as said in the opening remarks, given the steepness of the occupancy declines.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: Shankh, I was hoping you can provide some color on the investment pipeline and the types of deals that you've been able to source. I guess, prior market valuations appear to have held up well, especially given Welltower's recent sales, I guess, this past several months. I mean, what is or is there a difference between on the assets that you sold versus the deals that are in your pipeline, if you're being able to source at much below replacement costs?\nShankh Mitra: There is. So if you think about in today's marketplace, pay, if you take a very simple view of. What gets you financing is you've got to check three boxes, pretty assets, pretty market, most importantly, a very well-known well-reputed operator. If you can\u2019t check all those three boxes, it will be very hard, if not impossible for you to line up financing. And that gets you to the everything else outside that. We talked about this on the last call. We are bringing our operators into asset. So these assets will become financeable but today, it's not. Many of these assets were built in the last two, three years, so they don't have a stabilized 2019 NOI that a lender can underwrite. So a lot of things we're buying brand-new assets that have been built last two to three years, does not fit that criteria. So those are the ones that we are doing. Interestingly, if you see that in real estate over a period of time for apples-to-apples, newer asset trades for higher prices than lower, but just really difference of CapEx that's relative to vintage. Given what happened today in the marketplace, you are seeing exactly opposite of that. Newer assets are trading at a discount purely because they can get financing because they don't have a stabilized NOI for a lender to underwrite. And that's where we are coming in to buy things for cash. So we don't obviously put financing in, we buy assets for cash. And that bringing in our operators that these assets are obviously owned by other capital partners of our existing operators and we're buying this asset. So there is a difference. So if you think about what we sold that checks all the boxes, pretty assets, pretty market and very experienced and well-known well-reputed operator. You missed one of those checks, it comes back to pretty much very, very few buyers in the marketplace as well as dominant one.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Shank, let me offer my congrats on your promotion as well. And actually, the comments you had on the call regarding the portfolio buying and selling was definitely helpful. On the lines in our model that really sticks out is the gain on sale of properties with some $3 billion recognized over the last five years or so. So that's been now lost upon us. The question I really have, though, is just related to your comments on the lower expenses in the SHOP portfolio, particularly in the lower PPE, where you said the price per unit costs are now weighed down. Just curious how much you think that trend is more of a industry phenomenon versus how much Welltower maybe driving a better-than-average trend on that either due to some of the initiatives like the Dallas procurement center and other stuff that's more company specific. Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: I'd say we actually have wound down a lot of the activity that we had in the Dallas Procurement Center. That was very important to operations when -- to our operators' operations early on in the March and April period when the only way to access PPE or one of the only ways to kind of guarantee access to it was through scale. And I think as we've seen distribution channels normalize and they're still not back to where they would be pre-COVID. But as you've seen them normalize, our operator sale of assets PP&E and sales, and in instances like really haven't we've stepped in to help. But for the most part, that's going direct from operators to providers of PPE. And so I think in saying that the pricing is more of just seeing a bit of a normalization from -- if you look at mass prices where some as upwards of $8 on things are retailing $0.80 to $1.10 in a normal environment and they're still elevated even today. But if they're in the $3 to $4 range, it's come down significantly from what we're paying on average in the second quarter.\nTim McHugh: I'll just add some commentary to the first part of your question, which is I want you to understand that we're not trying to buy and sell assets like trade assets, that's not our goal. Obviously, when we see how to finance a transaction, we're trying to always think about what our sources of capital will be. Sometimes that could be stock at some point in the cycle, some point that could be the equity that's trapped into the asset that you think have maximized under your sort of umbrella. So we have alluded to this before that the huge amount of portfolio transformation, which I believe sort of amounts to close to $30 billion of asset disposition and acquisition over the last five years, is roughly complete. However, we have seen that the propensity of companies to continue to grow and that is not inside Welltower. We're always trying to think how we maximize value per share for the continuing shareholder. You can say the one good thing will be when you\u2019re exactly at the right place is just continue to sell your stock instead of selling your assets, and that would be a correct approach if you just look at capital allocation from the lens of spot NAV. I told you that's not how we see the world. We see the world from the perspective of long term IRR of what you're selling versus what you're buying and look at a comprehensive way of what your tools, the sort of sources and uses of capitals are. So we'll continue to do that. But the overall transformation of the portfolio that we wanted to do that some started, I would say we're roughly close to being done. But that doesn't mean that we'll not sell assets. We'll continue to sell assets if we think that is the best source of capital to fund what we are buying.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Mizuho.\nOmotayo Okusanya: So first question just around the senior housing. Again, we've kind of had its first round and you guys are getting some proceeds in 4Q. But I think clearly, everyone thinks that's not enough. I mean what's the viewpoint that you have internally of just what the government still has to do or what you would like to see the government do in regards to help for the industry to kind of stabilize then?\nShankh Mitra: We don't have an internal view of what we'd like to see the government do. I think it's been very beneficial to our operators to have seen them step in with the first tranche that they provided through HHS. And there's a second tranche that's currently being contemplated and has been open for application. It's more performance-based, the first one was just more based on 2019 revenue. But as far as kind of further funds from HHS, management doesn't have an internal view. Part of the reason why we\u2019ve acted the way we have as far as building our balance sheet and continuing to strengthen our capital position is that we're not reliant on the duration of the pandemic or the government taking a view on funds to the industry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.\nNicholas Yulico: Just a question on the move-ins. I know you guys pointed to Slide 16, which is showing the move-ins coming back versus February being indexed to February. And I guess I'm wondering though, why is February the appropriate month to be comparing to? I mean, isn't February, the dead of winter kind of a slower move in time, isn't the more relevant metric that your move-ins are down 39% from a year ago?\nShankh Mitra: We do think that's a relevant metric. That's why we put out in our slide deck. However, as far as we understand, if you think about the business, the February marks the last month of pre COVID. So we're trying to understand the business trends, how that has changed through COVID. So putting out last -- year-over-year is not a function of just what's happening today. It's also a function of what happened last year. All of us on this call know what happened last year at this point is fairly irrelevant given how COVID has changed our business. But we do think that the point that you're making, which is the year over year decline is an important one, and that's why we put it in board face on our slide deck.\nOperator: I show our last question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller: Just two quick ones here. Number one, should we think of all near-term acquisitions as pretty much entirely being focused on senior housing. And then second, can you update us on the progress at the 56th Street project that opened recently?\nShankh Mitra: So let me answer both of those two questions. Our near-term acquisition pipeline is primarily focused on senior housing. We have a couple of smaller MOB deals in the pipeline. However, it's primarily focused on senior housing because that's why we see the significant disruption on the pricing side. MOBs are not priced for distress and we see for the marginal use of the capital, we see significantly bigger opportunity on the senior housing side. And the East 56 Street, we're still waiting for our license, state seems to be opening up again for licensure. So when we get the licensure then we'll open the buildings for residents.\nOperator: We have a follow-up from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc.\nJordan Sadler: So I wanted to ask you and I might have missed this because I get drop for the second half of the call. But I had a question about sort of the market in general. I mean I appreciate your commentary and I know this has been your cadence about sort of buying low, selling high essentially, very focused on capital allocation. How would you characterize the market for seniors housing right now? In other words, supply of assets versus demand? I mean are we in equilibrium, or are people better to buy or better to sell? Is it tough to source stuff, easy to source stuff? How would you sort of characterize it?\nShankh Mitra: That's a great question, Jordan and it's a tale of two cities. If you have, as I described previously, pretty assets, pretty markets and most importantly, experienced operator and a stabilized 2019 NOI base that a lender can underwrite, you cannot -- there's a feeding frenzy. You cannot have enough assets for capital to buy, because everybody -- private capital is not focused on what's going to be the occupancy from fourth quarter. They're focused on what's coming for next three year, five year, 10 years, 15 years and the opportunity to make generational return given where we are from an industry perspective, the demand side of the equation. So that sort of -- you have one side. On the other side, the finance misses one of those -- one or more of those checks that I talked about that you cannot finance those transactions today. And because of that, usually, transactions like that has been financed in the bank side of the house rather than life companies or agencies on stabilized assets. And banks are obviously not lending in the space today anywhere close to where they were. I I almost would venture, I guess, to say they're not lending at all other than like a couple of select circumstances. So you have a tale of two cities on those kind of assets, which are not financeable because of the -- you didn't check all the three boxes that I talked about, there's almost no bid for the asset, because we have to buy those assets for cash. And there we have very significant buyers who know we buy assets and we buy everything for cash. And so we're finding tremendous opportunity on that. And frankly, as I described previously, we're finding many of these assets you can buy brand-new assets at a significantly lower price than the older assets purely because of all the margin building activity that happened in our industry from, call it, \u201816, '17 to '18, '19, and those assets are, in many cases, are not financeable, and we're finding tremendous risk adjusted return. bringing our operators and our data capabilities and filling those assets out that you will see in next few years.\nOperator: I show our last question and follow-up comes from Omotayo Okusanya from Mizuho.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Just another quick one. Is there any pressure to kind of ramp up acquisition activity in a world where you have at a kind of eliminates the 1031 exchanges. Like how does that kind of change how you think about deals going forward?\nShankh Mitra: There is only one pressure of buying things in our shop and that's price. We're not trying to fight assets exactly at the bottom regardless of outcome of election. It is possible that you will see asset prices are lower in three months than it is today. But again, if you think about the scale and scope of our balance sheet of how much value we want to create for our shareholders, if the asset prices go down we'll buy more. So there is no pressure other than price. And we can tell you at Welltower, we're [salivating] on the prices that we see today in the marketplace.\nOperator: Thank you. I do show we have a question -- I show no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call over to management.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you very much. We'll see you in another 90 days. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these difficult times. Before I get into the accomplishment for the quarter and discuss our capital allocation strategy, let me make some comments on leadership changes and strategy going forward for Welltower. Let me start with our outgoing CEO, my close friend and mentor, Tom DeRosa. Tom's impact on our industry, our company and me can never be overstated. He was a visionary who saw the need of integrating senior housing into healthcare continuum years before COVID and now we all know the importance of that today and going forward. He was a successful entrepreneur -- he took a successful entrepreneurial company and made it a process driven institutional company that attracted an incredible caliber of talent. And last but not the least, his contribution on me personally and my career can never be overemphasized. He has been a terrific boss, a great mentor and a close friend. He continues to help me even today and guide me in as necessary. We wish Tom the very best in his retirement. I'm also pleased to announce that Phil Hawkins one of the most well respected ex-CEOs of the REIT space has joined our board. We're looking forward to Phil's guidance and mentorship for many years to come. And finally, I'm thrilled to be working with a new independent Chairman of the Board, Ken Bacon, with a strong track record of leadership and experience, both in real estate and finance. Ken, will lead our board and partner with me and our leadership team as we execute our company strategy. As far as our team is concerned, the company has never been in a better place. There are about 20 women and men who are leading this company forward every day. I cannot be more proud of this team. In the coming weeks and months, you will see a series of promotions and new roles that will consolidate the leadership of this company, not a change per se, just a recognition of the exceptional work that the team is doing. Our team has never been busier and more excited to create once in a lifetime value for our owners. Many of you have asked me if our strategy will change going forward. The answer to that question is an emphatic no. Welltower will continue to strive to be the premier wellness infrastructure company that allocates capital in the path of growth of healthcare and wellness trends. You're not going to get any grand strategic pronouncement from me. We'll continue to focus on creating value for our partners and our employees, if they create significant value for our owners. And the partners and employees will be able to create long term sustainable value, only if their end customers are happy. It is that simple. We do not need to complicate a simple idea. We need to continue to execute and deliver superior cash flow growth on a per share basis. To paraphrase one of my favorite CEOs of all time, Tom Murphy, the goal is not to have the longest wait but we arrive at the station first using the least amount of wealth. We will continue to be vigilant as ever that institutional imperative do not fit into our culture and we remain focused on efficiency of the platform, data driven decision making and employee satisfaction. Given it is my first call as CEO, I lay out a simple capital allocation framework for you. A company effectively has four choices of raising capital; capping internal cash flow, issuing debt, issuing equity and disposition of its existing assets. It also has five essential choices of deploying that capital; investing in existing assets, acquisitions, paying down debt, paying dividends and buying back stock. You can loosely call the first set of choices as selling, but right description of that would be sourcing or raising capital. You can loosely call the second set of choices as buying, but the client description would be deployment of capital. Following the same line of thinking, loosely speaking, consistent buying low and selling high creates value for our shareholders in a more wholesome and thoughtful description, pptimizing these choices from this menu of sources and uses in a tax efficient manner creates value for continuing shareholder on per share basis. The goal is to maximize cash flow and value per share, not to become the biggest or the most revolutionary. We at Welltower do not spend a second strategizing on how to win the popularity contest on Wall Street. In fact, as stated in the past, we focused on buying assets when they're out of favor that is unpopular at the right price in the right structure. Ultimately, this capital deployment strategy allows for outsized return with a large margin of safety. Price, not exposure, is the ultimate mitigant of risk. We are constantly striving to create value and trust you as our shareholders will reward the companies that create true intrinsic value over long term. If you allow me to continue this theme of sourcing and deployment of capital, let's look at what we have achieved in Q3 and post quarter close. We are delighted to inform you that we have executed on two large senior housing transactions at a valuation significant in excess of $400,000 units in the mid 3% cap rate on current NOI and around 5% cap rate on pre COVID NOI. These transactions with our Invesco joint venture on MOBs puts us in an enviable position of balance sheet strength. We currently have $5.2 billion of liquidity and $2.2 billion of cash, which is expected to rise further as the quarter progresses. We at Welltower do not see balance sheet as a matter of vanity like vintage cars, but the most important countercyclical tool to create value at the cycle lows and avoid the need of raising dilutive capital at exactly the wrong time in the cycle. That gets us to our menu of capital deployment to particular interest investing in hard assets and doubling down on the assets that we already own through buying back our own stock. In matter of any acquisitions as is with stocks patients is a virtue with occasional boldness, and we think that moment of occasional boldness is finally here. We have in excess of $1 billion of acquisition in our pipeline comprised of 6,500-plus units at an average price of $165,000 unit at a material discount to replacement cost. 17 deals in the pipeline represents a wide range of transactions from $10 million redevelopment asset to $188 million core portfolio of brand-new assets. We have identified many of these assets working with our existing partners through our data analytics platform or who are buying out other capital partner of our existing operators. The pipeline's initial yield is at low 4s but we believe it will stabilize in the high single-digit to low double-digit yields. As is a very short term but incorrect way to look at this will be, we're deploying capital in the low 4% trends and sourcing that capital in the mid 3% range. We believe the correct way to look at this will be that we are sourcing that capital in the mid single digit unlevered IRR and deploying at a low double digit unlevered IRR, as evidenced by sourcing the capital in the 400,000 plus per unit level and deploying that capital at $165,000 per unit level. Despite our weak cost of public capital, this rate has never been wider and hence the opportunity to create generational value for our owners on a per share basis. And that completes the look for you and explains why our team is so excited and so busy. We believe we are making real impact and anticipate creating exceptional value. We not only see this environment as an opportunity for smart capital allocation in the financial realm, but also in the human capital area. We are seeing availability of superior talent in the marketplace today and we're bouncing on this opportunity as we are on the investment side. With that, I will hand the mic over to Tim, who will walk you through the operational and financial results for the quarter. I will come back to make some additional comments on the operating environment after him. Tim? Thanks, Tim. Let me provide you some color on underlying trends of what's happening in the senior housing business. Needless to say that we're very encouraged by the sequential stabilization of NOI in the quarter. I would like to draw your attention to Slide 16 of our deck, which describes a significant sequential improvement of move ins. Last quarter, I talked about the hesitation of customers to move in after they put a deposit on. As communities resumed visitation, we have seen a significant improvement in this area, frankly, which was my biggest concern as described last quarter call. Let's take an example of five very large operators, which constitute of national operators, large regional operators in Northeast, West Coast and Sunbelt, a pretty diverse group. The average delay between deposit to move in during October of last year was 19 days. In March of this year, it was 17 days, that increased to a whopping 41 days in June. We have seen a meaningful decrease every month in Q3 and finally, it is down to about 18 days in October. We are hearing from our AL focus partners that in many cases this lag is now getting shorter than pre covet days as families can no longer delay the care needs of their loved ones. No question, we're very encouraged by that. However, we are unwilling to project this moving trend as we are in middle of a third wave of COVID across the country. It will be a complete full hurry for us to predict how things will play out in next few weeks and months before the COVID car flattens out again. But the experience of this accelerated move-ins in the pace of move ins tells you that our customers need our product. They moved in as soon as they could. We have no ability to predict when we'll be on the other side of the COVID but we're optimistic when that they finally come, our need-based product will likely to see meaningful traction in demand. What bridges us between now and then is our fortress balance sheet and what creates value between now and then is our ability to allocate capital to make outsized returns for our owners. In this age of Torrens of information, it is sometimes hard to differentiate signals from noise. It is important that we periodically take a step back and remind ourselves that stock is a fractional ownership in a business and not a ticker. As managers of the business we can assure you that our team has never been more energized and excited about creating long term value for our shareholders. With that, we'll open the call up for questions. So Steve, leads has not been a problem even when we were here 90 days ago, leads have come back, not completely to pre COVID level but definitely on a year-over-year basis but sequentially it has. And it is even on a year-over-year basis, it's approaching pre COVID level, maybe 10%, 50% still lower. But we're definitely approaching the amount of leads and the quality leads, more importantly, in the system. The issue has been that you obviously had a very good follow-through of how many people are doing -- either seeing the units, whether virtually or physically and then getting to the deposit. That's what I talked about the pressure on the sort of the front door, if you will. That has not been the issue. The issue has been that the customer was hesitating after that. This is a purely an AL focused comment. We're still seeing hesitation in the IL focused communities where if you don't have a need, you're taking time to make a decision. I mean, with all the noise and then obviously, hopeful good news on vaccines, people are just taking time. I can't tell you why that is the case but on the IL side, people are taking the time. On the AL side, we have faced that pressure on the front door but that was not translating into the move-in, that sale was not translating into the move-in, which we kind of described that. And since we said that, we have seen some clearly significant improvement in that area. So that's what we're seeing in that rapid pace of acceleration in that move-in and that continued even through last week. We're actually not seeing a lot of dispersion in markets per se, there's a huge dispersion from a product-type perspective. So you were seeing whether in the West Coast, East Coast or Texas, or you pick your market. If you have a need driven product, the customer's willingness to make a decision is significantly higher. And frankly, we are hearing from some of our partners that, that is even accelerated relative to even pre COVID levels. But in case of where you have a lifestyle-driven product where somebody wants to be in that environment but doesn't have to be, you are still seeing visitation. So it's not a market driven, it is definitely a product driven phenomena. So I will tell you, look, as you guys know that Tom has trained me for the job over many years and definitely been very influenced by how he saw the world. The first and foremost, he had taught us and that sort of ingrained in my leadership style as well as a lot of other people in our leadership team is to take that what we can do more from this platform, not just think about disparate aggregation of assets but thinking through platform. And the importance of being on the bleeding edge of healthcare and wellness trends and that will continue to happen. I'm very much focused on execution, very much focused on per share value creation. And that's what the team made and capital allocation. So everybody's leadership style is different and I would -- obviously, it is less important on the difference between Tom's leadership style and my leadership style, I will tell you, that it is as collectively as the leadership team, we see our biggest focus today is to increase the value per share execute. And obviously, there's a tremendous amount of potential for us to get back to our lost earnings, not just to the recover level. As you imagine, we have talked about even pre COVID, our portfolio was under leased and get back to that and create that value through execution and capital allocation, and that's what we are focused on today. Dan, you asked a very interesting question. If you think about move outs, move outs have come down pretty much across the board for over last seven, eight months through COVID. Last couple of weeks, I would say that we have seen some increased move-outs. It's hard to say why that is the case, because it's too short of a time frame to make this as a trend. But it is also the most difficult part of our business to predict. It is all of the above of what you mentioned as reason for move out. We don't see financial reasons for move out in our industry, but we have seen some elevated move-outs for last couple of weeks. We also saw some reduced move outs few weeks before that. This is a very, very hard business to predict on a weekly basis, monthly basis. So I think it is hard for us to sort of get into that and see what the trend and what's not. You could take us for weeks and say the first two weeks is that you wanted to have an optimistic bench, and you could have said that I will take that move-out trends and move-in trends and project, or you could have taken the last two weeks of elevated move out trends and project forward, and there's no right and wrong answer. We have just done the latter part or the first part. But we could be wrong and things can turn out to be better than we thought. But as we sit here today with the uncertainty that we see the overall, the national COVID environment, I think it's prudent for us to, at this point, not to try to get to too excited about what might or might not happen. No, Juan. It simply means that the customers need our product. So what has been going on is with all the national headlines and all the COVID and the overall situations, people are hesitating. Now we obviously have a need that's sort of adding up. And now the customers are saying, well, they can move in, again, we're not projecting that into the future, that's a very important point. If we did then we would not give you the guidance for fourth quarter that we did. But very much with thinking that very simply the customer has moved in when they could. Now if COVID spiked up again and they can because you have visitation bans or you have shutdown of facilities and all of those things, that you will see that. But most importantly, they moved in when they can. I was simply answering the question on the need-driven nature of our product and the secular demand of the product. COVID will eventually be behind us and the demand of the product hasn't changed through this period of time. Connor, we have made a very significant improvement even in last 90 days on point-of-care testing. We tested over 200,000 employees and residents and that continues to progress. We got some very significant improvement, I would say, in the last 45 days in that particular area, a point of -- in the testing side. But it's too premature to say how that will impact the consumer behavior and the ability to move in people. We think it will improve. But again, given the overall uncertain environment, it is too early for us to comment. I don't have the number percentage for you, but I can tell you that both of -- what was -- the two portfolios were sold, they were not in RIDEA 3.0 contracts. So your fundamental assumption will be correct. Lukas, can you repeat please one more time? There is. So if you think about in today's marketplace, pay, if you take a very simple view of. What gets you financing is you've got to check three boxes, pretty assets, pretty market, most importantly, a very well-known well-reputed operator. If you can't check all those three boxes, it will be very hard, if not impossible for you to line up financing. And that gets you to the everything else outside that. We talked about this on the last call. We are bringing our operators into asset. So these assets will become financeable but today, it's not. Many of these assets were built in the last two, three years, so they don't have a stabilized 2019 NOI that a lender can underwrite. So a lot of things we're buying brand-new assets that have been built last two to three years, does not fit that criteria. So those are the ones that we are doing. Interestingly, if you see that in real estate over a period of time for apples-to-apples, newer asset trades for higher prices than lower, but just really difference of CapEx that's relative to vintage. Given what happened today in the marketplace, you are seeing exactly opposite of that. Newer assets are trading at a discount purely because they can get financing because they don't have a stabilized NOI for a lender to underwrite. And that's where we are coming in to buy things for cash. So we don't obviously put financing in, we buy assets for cash. And that bringing in our operators that these assets are obviously owned by other capital partners of our existing operators and we're buying this asset. So there is a difference. So if you think about what we sold that checks all the boxes, pretty assets, pretty market and very experienced and well-known well-reputed operator. You missed one of those checks, it comes back to pretty much very, very few buyers in the marketplace as well as dominant one. I'd say we actually have wound down a lot of the activity that we had in the Dallas Procurement Center. That was very important to operations when -- to our operators' operations early on in the March and April period when the only way to access PPE or one of the only ways to kind of guarantee access to it was through scale. And I think as we've seen distribution channels normalize and they're still not back to where they would be pre-COVID. But as you've seen them normalize, our operator sale of assets PP&E and sales, and in instances like really haven't we've stepped in to help. But for the most part, that's going direct from operators to providers of PPE. And so I think in saying that the pricing is more of just seeing a bit of a normalization from -- if you look at mass prices where some as upwards of $8 on things are retailing $0.80 to $1.10 in a normal environment and they're still elevated even today. But if they're in the $3 to $4 range, it's come down significantly from what we're paying on average in the second quarter. We don't have an internal view of what we'd like to see the government do. I think it's been very beneficial to our operators to have seen them step in with the first tranche that they provided through HHS. And there's a second tranche that's currently being contemplated and has been open for application. It's more performance-based, the first one was just more based on 2019 revenue. But as far as kind of further funds from HHS, management doesn't have an internal view. Part of the reason why we've acted the way we have as far as building our balance sheet and continuing to strengthen our capital position is that we're not reliant on the duration of the pandemic or the government taking a view on funds to the industry. We do think that's a relevant metric. That's why we put out in our slide deck. However, as far as we understand, if you think about the business, the February marks the last month of pre COVID. So we're trying to understand the business trends, how that has changed through COVID. So putting out last -- year-over-year is not a function of just what's happening today. It's also a function of what happened last year. All of us on this call know what happened last year at this point is fairly irrelevant given how COVID has changed our business. But we do think that the point that you're making, which is the year over year decline is an important one, and that's why we put it in board face on our slide deck. So let me answer both of those two questions. Our near-term acquisition pipeline is primarily focused on senior housing. We have a couple of smaller MOB deals in the pipeline. However, it's primarily focused on senior housing because that's why we see the significant disruption on the pricing side. MOBs are not priced for distress and we see for the marginal use of the capital, we see significantly bigger opportunity on the senior housing side. And the East 56 Street, we're still waiting for our license, state seems to be opening up again for licensure. So when we get the licensure then we'll open the buildings for residents. That's a great question, Jordan and it's a tale of two cities. If you have, as I described previously, pretty assets, pretty markets and most importantly, experienced operator and a stabilized 2019 NOI base that a lender can underwrite, you cannot -- there's a feeding frenzy. You cannot have enough assets for capital to buy, because everybody -- private capital is not focused on what's going to be the occupancy from fourth quarter. They're focused on what's coming for next three year, five year, 10 years, 15 years and the opportunity to make generational return given where we are from an industry perspective, the demand side of the equation. So that sort of -- you have one side. On the other side, the finance misses one of those -- one or more of those checks that I talked about that you cannot finance those transactions today. And because of that, usually, transactions like that has been financed in the bank side of the house rather than life companies or agencies on stabilized assets. And banks are obviously not lending in the space today anywhere close to where they were. I I almost would venture, I guess, to say they're not lending at all other than like a couple of select circumstances. So you have a tale of two cities on those kind of assets, which are not financeable because of the -- you didn't check all the three boxes that I talked about, there's almost no bid for the asset, because we have to buy those assets for cash. And there we have very significant buyers who know we buy assets and we buy everything for cash. And so we're finding tremendous opportunity on that. And frankly, as I described previously, we're finding many of these assets you can buy brand-new assets at a significantly lower price than the older assets purely because of all the margin building activity that happened in our industry from, call it, \u201816, '17 to '18, '19, and those assets are, in many cases, are not financeable, and we're finding tremendous risk adjusted return. bringing our operators and our data capabilities and filling those assets out that you will see in next few years. There is only one pressure of buying things in our shop and that's price. We're not trying to fight assets exactly at the bottom regardless of outcome of election. It is possible that you will see asset prices are lower in three months than it is today. But again, if you think about the scale and scope of our balance sheet of how much value we want to create for our shareholders, if the asset prices go down we'll buy more. So there is no pressure other than price. And we can tell you at Welltower, we're [salivating] on the prices that we see today in the marketplace. Thank you very much. We'll see you in another 90 days. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on the third quarter 2020 results and performance of all property segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet liquidity update. In the third quarter, Welltower reported normalized FFO of $0.84 per diluted share, a $0.02 decline from second quarter, driven by $0.03 of dilution from dispositions completed in Q2 and Q3, a $0.01 negative impact from changes in revenue recognition in our post-acute senior housing triple net portfolios and a slight decline in sequential senior housing operating performance. Those items were offset by tighter cost controls at corporate and reduction in COVID-related expenses in our senior housing operating portfolio. As a reminder, on the dilution type dispositions, we had $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, inclusive 10/31 deposits as of 9/30. Now turning to our individual property segments. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple net lease portfolio covered an occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30/2020 and therefore, only reflect a partial impact on COVID-19. Across all triple net lease segments, Welltower collected 98% of contractual rent due in the third quarter. Now starting with our senior housing triple net portfolio. Same-store NOIs declined 10 basis points year-over-year and higher bad debt accrual and a tough comp drove growth slightly negative. The combined FFO impact of revenue recognition changes on one restructured lease in the quarter was $0.05 relative to 2Q and expected to grow to a full penny in 4Q., i.e., another half penny impact sequentially from 3Q to 4Q. Occupancy was down 390 basis points sequentially and EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.02x on a sequential basis to 1.02. Consistent with my comments in the past, our senior housing triple-net operators experienced the same headwind server day operators over the past seven months, and we expect reported lease coverage starts stats to continue to reflect these challenges and more of the pandemic periods reflected EBITDAR going forward. In the quarter, we also transitioned five of a planned nine properties from Capital Senior to StoryPoint Senior Living and expect the other four properties to transition by the end of the year. This is the first phase of the transition agreement we entered into with Capital Senior at beginning of the year, which allowed for an early termination of CSUs leases on 24 Welltower owned assets in exchange for full year 2020 rent being paid in cooperation with transitioning the operations. Despite the challenging environment, our team and our operators have been able to organize and execute transition plans with StoryPoint transitions as well as the remaining 15 properties CSU currently operates, which will be transitioned to three of our existing RIDEA operators in the fourth quarter. As a result of the COVID backdrop, the initial expected dilution from the conversion is expected to be approximately $12 million or $0.03 per share in 2021 relative to rent recognized in 2020. As a reminder, since our capital senior rent continues to be paid, the leases on these assets that have yet to be transitioned are reflected on our payment coverage stratification presentation on Page 7 of our supplement and make up roughly three fourths of the triple-net senior housing rent that is less than 0.85x covered by EBITDA. Although the last seven months have been very challenging for the senior housing triple operators, the sequential stabilization we observed between the second and third quarter, along with relief funds from HHS we received in the fourth quarter, should help our operators find their footing heading into 2021. Turning to long term post acute portfolio. We generated positive 2% year-over-year same store growth and EBITDAR coverage decline by 0.1x sequentially. As noted in our business update earlier this month and in last night's release, Genesis Healthcare, which makes up approximately half of our long term post acute segment exposure, includes language in the second quarter financials filed on August 10th regarding its ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of this, Welltower began recording Genesis lease revenue on a cash basis in the third quarter, retroactive to July 1st. This had a negative $2.2 million impact or approximately half of penny FFO per share relative to second quarter 2020. This also resulted in writedown of $97 million of straight line rent receivables. Genesis continues to remain current on all financial obligations to Welltower through October. And lastly, within our triple net lease segments, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System. NOI growth was positive 2.3% year-over-year, driven by 2.75% increase during August and trailing 12 month EBITDAR coverage was 2.61 times. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical portfolio delivered positive 1% same store growth. This below trend growth was driven mainly by increased bad debt reserve, majority of which related to lease enforcement moratoriums in several California jurisdictions, which we have a sizable footprint. As these moratoriums expire, we spent rent collection to further improve. We continue to see signs across our outpatient portfolio that activities returned to pre COVID levels, evidenced by the number of tenant work order requests received, our tenant's own volume data and park income in our properties. In the quarter, park income was still a slight headwind year-over-year, but its negative contribution to NOI growth decreased to 10 basis points this quarter versus 70 basis points in the second quarter. During the quarter, we collected approximately 97% of contractual rents and had an additional 2% of rents deferred, the majority of which are located in the aforementioned jurisdictions with lease enforcement moratoriums. We also continue to have very strong rent collection and deferral plans we put in place in April, May and June. Since we started collecting on these plans in June, we've experienced 99.5% collection rates through September. As a reminder, the large majority of our second quarter deferral plans were structured to pay back entirely by year-end. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before reviewing this quarter's senior housing operating portfolio results, I want to briefly summarize the outlook we provided back in us. At that time, our expectations for the third quarter was that occupancy would be down between 125 and 175 basis points from July 1st through September 30th. And that REVPOR and total expenses would be flat sequentially. We ended the quarter with occupancy down 150 basis points start to finish. REVPOR was down 40 basis points, and expenses were down 3.4%. Turning to results in the quarter. Same store NOI decreased 27.3% as compared to the third quarter of 2019, driven largely by 680 basis point year-over-year drop in average occupancy. As we indicated last quarter, two factors drove this outsized decline in occupancy. First, the portfolio began the third quarter at significantly lower level of occupancy, following the steep drop experienced in the second quarter and continued to decline during the quarter, albeit at a significantly decelerated pace from 2Q. And secondly, we experienced a seasonal increase in occupancy in the third quarter of 2019, creating tougher sequential comp. REVPOR for the quarter was down 1% year-over-year, but I want to provide a bit more color here. The next shift is distorting the use of this metric as a proxy for rate growth. Over the last two quarters, our lower acuity properties, active adult independent living, have held up considerably better on the occupancy front than our higher acuity buildings. This has driven up the percentage of total portfolio occupied units that are lower acuity and therefore, lower rent paying units. This has had the mathematical effect of averaging down our total portfolio of rent per occupied unit. If you break the portfolio into two buckets, active adult independent living in one and assisted living and memory care in the other, you will see the lower acuity bucket had 20 basis point decrease in REVPOR year-over-year, while the higher acuity bucket had a positive 1.4% year-over-year change. While we are seeing as in some select discounting on room rates in some of our markets, in general, rates continue to be fairly resilient in the face of occupancy declines. And lastly, SHO operating expenses. Same store operating expenses declined 1.1% year-over-year and declined 3.3% sequentially. I'll focus on sequential growth since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. We experienced fairly expected sequential expense trends driven by two main items; lower compensation growth as operators adjusted their staffing to lower occupancy levels and lower COVID expenses as same- tore COVID expenses decreased from $33 million to $50 million sequentially, driven by lower emergency staffing costs and significant reductions in price per unit cost of PPE. We expect COVID-related costs to continue to decrease in the fourth quarter, but at a much lower pace than in 3Q. Looking forward to the fourth quarter and starting with October data we've already observed, we've experienced a 30 basis point decline in occupancy to the week of October 23rd. And we expect to finish the fourth quarter approximately 75 basis points to 125 basis points lower than where we ended the third quarter. We also expect both ROVPAR and total expenses to be flat on a sequential basis. This outlook does not include any impact from HHS funds that maybe received in the fourth quarter. Now on to capital markets activity. In July, we completed the successful tender of $426 million of our 3.75% and 3.95% senior notes due in 2023. Proceeds for the tender were generated from the June issuance of $600 million in senior unsecured notes bearing interest rate of 2.75% with maturity date of January 2031. We used the remaining proceeds to pay down $140 million of our term loan due in 2022. These transactions both derisk near-term maturities through 2023 and increased our unsecured bond borrowings weighted average maturity to 9.2 years. Additionally, in the quarter, we repaid $289 million of secured debt of which $112 million was the fee and subsequently extinguished in October. Moving to investment activity, which was mainly focused on our development pipeline with $96 million invested this quarter. On the disposition front, we completed $1.4 billion of pro rata dispositions at a 5.3 cap rate. Post quarter end, we closed on the previously announced sale of a senior housing operating portfolio for $200 million or $395,000 per unit. The sales price represents a cap rate of 2.6% based on third quarter annualized NOI and a 4.9% cap rate on pre-COVID or March trailing 12-month NOI. Inclusive of this disposition, we completed $3.3 billion dispositions year-to-date at a 5.4% cap rate. We expect to close another $186 million of transactions in the fourth quarter comprised of secondary tranches or [ROPAR] asset sales tied to previously executed outpatient medical transactions. The near-term FFO impact from the completion of these intra and post-quarter dispositions will be approximately $0.03 per share sequentially in the fourth quarter, and will bring cash and cash equivalents to $2.4 billion and total liquidity to $5.4 billion. We believe that the continued ability to execute dispositions of strong pricing supports our view that our private cost of equity capital is substantially better than our public costs at this time. Underlying cash flow continues to be impacted by a challenging backdrop. We ended the quarter at 6.02 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 34 basis point increase from last quarter as a result of liquidity generated successful dispositions in the quarter, which have continued to bolster the balance sheet. Adjusting for EBITDA loss to sales in the quarter and the post quarter end sales just mentioned, run rate net debt to EBITDA is approximately 6.1 times, with $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. I'll start with that, Rich. It's higher than we usually see. You typically see kind of a 50 basis point decrease over that stretches from 4Q to 1Q, but over a typical seasonality of occupancy, you'll see 50 basis points lost over kind of the fourth quarter and first quarter. So this higher than that. And I think speaking about the seasonality is improvement, because it adds some uncertainty to the number, which is factored in now we're looking at the fourth quarter. We've talked about this a bit, at this point, in some ways, it's a best guy's hypothesis and that we won't see as much of a seasonal change in demand just due to the disruption we've seen in this demand during the year. And so seasonality, there's two things that drive seasonality. There's change in seasonal demand and there's also the impact of the flu. I think data is very supportive of the flu. At this point won't play a large role in the typical seasonality we see. And on the demand side, we don't necessarily think that the typical demand changes we see will play a role. But the 100 basis points is really just due to the COVID environment, what we've seen so far in the quarter. And certainly, when I say COVID environment, it's really the national picture, the acceleration in cases and it's that adding a bit of certainty to what the outlook is for the next two, three months. So I think from the numbers and we're seeing in the market is we're not seeing a lot of evidence of concession. I think as Shank spoke to probably seeing more on the lower acuity side as far as just what we're seeing in the market as far as it's because of some of the difference in kind of needs-based aspect of it that there is a little bit more of a consumer discretionary goods and therefore, you're seeing a bit more of that, I'd say, in the front end whereas on the assisted living side, you're seeing very little bit. We've talked about this a bit, community fees, which typically align with when you move in and are both kind of cover costs to move in, as well as having testing, et cetera, to get your acuity level of care. So you're seeing some discounting of those. And so we've said the combination of community fees coming through REVPOR is that you have people moving in on a year-over-year basis. So you're seeing kind of community fees in total come down and also you're seeing some discounting. And in assisted living importantly you're not seeing discounting in care and more of the residents we're seeing coming in, they're coming in because of the care. And so there isn't a lot of price competition there. Reputation is a huge factor. You saw some competition in general in the market to the supply cycle over the last couple of years impact pricing. I'd say in the COVID environment, you're actually seeing a bit of that dissipate because more of the consumer residents are being attracted towards the better brand names and more well-known names in the market. So assisted living pricing is holding up, I'd say, pretty well, as said in the opening remarks, given the steepness of the occupancy declines. I'll just add some commentary to the first part of your question, which is I want you to understand that we're not trying to buy and sell assets like trade assets, that's not our goal. Obviously, when we see how to finance a transaction, we're trying to always think about what our sources of capital will be. Sometimes that could be stock at some point in the cycle, some point that could be the equity that's trapped into the asset that you think have maximized under your sort of umbrella. So we have alluded to this before that the huge amount of portfolio transformation, which I believe sort of amounts to close to $30 billion of asset disposition and acquisition over the last five years, is roughly complete. However, we have seen that the propensity of companies to continue to grow and that is not inside Welltower. We're always trying to think how we maximize value per share for the continuing shareholder. You can say the one good thing will be when you're exactly at the right place is just continue to sell your stock instead of selling your assets, and that would be a correct approach if you just look at capital allocation from the lens of spot NAV. I told you that's not how we see the world. We see the world from the perspective of long term IRR of what you're selling versus what you're buying and look at a comprehensive way of what your tools, the sort of sources and uses of capitals are. So we'll continue to do that. But the overall transformation of the portfolio that we wanted to do that some started, I would say we're roughly close to being done. But that doesn't mean that we'll not sell assets. We'll continue to sell assets if we think that is the best source of capital to fund what we are buying."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatt McQueen: Thank you and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Tom for his remarks. Tom?\nTom DeRosa: Thanks, Matt. First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these difficult times. When we last spoke with you in early May, Welltower was in the midst of the most challenging period in the company\u2019s history. Many of our senior housing and post-acute care operators had implemented admissions bans to prevent or control the spread of COVID within their communities. Critical personal protective equipment and testing kits were difficult to procure and labor challenges left many of our operators short-staffed. However, I am pleased to report that significant progress has been made on all of these fronts. And that most of our properties have reopened with appropriate staffing levels and requisite PPE and testing kits. This was accomplished through careful planning and precautionary measures taken by our operators. In fact, in just a few months, 95% of our senior housing operating communities are now accepting new residents. And this is significant, because our communities are a critical component to the care continuum. It is imperative that seniors have access to residential settings, in which professional care is offered to meet their everyday needs, including safety, nutrition, hygiene, and medication management. It is important to remember that this is a need-driven asset class. Welltower\u2019s traditional assisted living portfolio is skewed towards higher acuity settings, which are built for seniors, who have exhausted the ability to be cared for in a conventional home setting. We continue to owe a debt of gratitude to the frontline workers in all of our properties, who braved extraordinary obstacles to put the care of their residents above all house. While I\u2019m encouraged by our progress, by no means are we signaling the all clear. We are acutely aware of the heightened level of risk, which continues to exist, particularly at the number of COVID cases in the U.S., continues to rise. As Shankh and Tim will describe in greater detail, the toll from COVID on our business has been and will continue to be pronounced. However, the decisions we have made since the beginning of the pandemic and the steps we have taken over the past five years to strengthen our enterprise have put us in a position to weather this storm. These decisions while often difficult are rooted in data and always executed with the long-term interest of our shareholders in mind. This management team has earned a reputation for taking on both opportunities and issues in a proactive manner and COVID-19 has not changed that. One of the strongest examples of this approach relates to our recent efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet. As financial conditions begin to \u2013 began to deteriorate at the outset of the pandemic. Our team did not panic. Instead through a thoughtful and deliberate process, we obtained a $1 billion term loan providing us with ample flexibility in the event of a prolonged market downturn. As conditions improved in subsequent months, our team waited for an opportune time at which to return to the public market. And in June, we issued $600 million of unsecured debt at just 2.75%, a lowest coupon on 10-year notes in Welltower\u2019s history. These actions are a reflection of Tim McHugh and his team\u2019s responsible stewardship of our balance sheet, and the confidence from investors and our banking partners in the Welltower platform. Another major achievement was the disposition of two large portfolios of seniors housing and outpatient medical assets with a combined total value of $1.3 billion. These sales were executed during a time in which few real estate assets traded and when the ability for senior housing to withstand the impact of COVID was called into question. Most notably, our $1 billion transaction with Kayne Anderson provided significant and immediate liquidity to Welltower in a period of under 45 days and was executed at valuation levels, which were only modestly below pre-COVID pricing. Again, we were not back into a corner to complete these deals. The valuation we achieved demonstrated the appreciation for the long-term growth prospects for healthcare real estate, by astute investors and the strong liquidity, which exists for our asset class. I applaud our investment teams for their perseverance in completing these deals under the most extenuating circumstances. As the year progresses, you should expect to see more of this. Following the completion of our capital markets activity and portfolio dispositions, our near-term liquidity stands at $4.3 billion. The company is extremely well-positioned to address all near-term capital obligations and its ample capacity to execute on accretive opportunities as they arise. Our team will continue to explore all avenues, through which to create value for our shareholders. And regardless of how strong our liquidity position is today; our underwriting discipline will not be compromised. Many questions were made on answered after the duration and ultimate impact of COVID-19. However, what we can say with great certainty is that the long-term drivers of our business remain firmly intact. The population is growing older. The need for value based healthcare is as important as ever and addressing social determinants of health will only grow in relevance. While it\u2019s often difficult to see past the next week or next quarter, rest assured that Welltower\u2019s long-term value proposition has not changed. There will be challenging times ahead, but we are confident that the company is positioned to navigate through these choppy waters and emerge as the continued leader in delivering the real estate that will enable more efficient and cost-effective healthcare and wellness. With that, I\u2019ll turn the mic to Tim.\nTim McHugh: Thank you, Tom. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2020 results. The impact of COVID-19 in our business observed this quarter, our capital activity in the quarter, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update. In second quarter, Welltower reported normalized FFO of $0.86 per diluted share. These results include a total of $37 million or approximately $0.09 per share of property level costs in our senior housing operating portfolio associated with COVID-19 pandemic. As we indicated last quarter, Welltower is elected to not normalize these COVID-related expenses both normalized FFO and same-store results. Now, turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our Triple-Net portfolios. As a reminder, our Triple-Net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported quarter in arrears. These statistics reflect the trailing 12-months ending 3/31/2020, and therefore, only reflect a partial impact in COVID-19. In the quarter, we collected 98% of cash rents due on these portfolios and as of last night\u2019s release; we\u2019ve collected 97% of cash rents due in July, which is in-line with previous months\u2019 collections at this time. First, our Senior Housing Triple-Net portfolio delivered 1.4% positive year-over-year same-store growth, and the difficult comp combined with an increased bad debt drove growth below original expectations. Occupancy was down 50 basis points sequentially and EBITDAR coverage increased 0.01 turns on a sequential basis in this portfolio. Our Senior Housing Triple-Net operators have experienced similar headwinds as everyday operates during the second quarter and we expect these coverages and occupancy stats reflect that going forward. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generating positive 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth and EBITDAR coverage declined 0.04 times sequentially. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our HCR ManorCare joint venture with ProMedica, a NOI growth at positive 1.375% year-over-year and EBITDAR coverage declined one basis points sequentially to 2.13 times. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical portfolio delivered positive 1.8% same-store growth. As a significant year-over-year decrease in the parking revenue caused by national shelter in place orders during the quarter, along with an increase in bad debt accrual was slightly offset by better than expected tenant retention. New leasing lastly remains uneven as a result of COVID. The second quarter ran behind pre-COVID budget by 104,000 square feet, but the gap began had narrowed June and July with new leasing exceeding budget by 44,000 square feet in July. During the quarter reflecting approximately 87% of cash rents, while approving 12% of rents for two months deferral plan. With the slower than expected reopening of certain regions in our portfolio caused more deferrals in the May-June period and we anticipated when we reported our first quarter numbers, we are encouraged by the momentum in the rebounding tenant openings, they accelerated in the back half of June and July driving cash rent collections to 95% in July. We\u2019ve also had strong deferred rent collection in June and July as our two-month deferral plans began repayment. We collected 96% of what was due over this period. We\u2019re extremely proud of the Welltower outpatient medical employees, both onsite and working from home, who have kept our platform running smoothly during these extraordinary times. Before viewing this quarter\u2019s senior housing operating portfolio results, I want to briefly summarize the outlook we provided back in May when it certainly was at its peak. At that time, our expectations were that occupancy would be down between 500 basis points to 600 basis points from April 1 through June 30. The RevPAR would be flat on a year-over-year basis that expenses would increase by 5% sequentially driven primarily by labor costs. Before turning to how things actually turned out in the quarter, I\u2019d like to first point out that our same-store pool is now represented a 91% of our total senior housing operating NOI, this will continue to increase in the year-end. In the quarter, occupancy declined in our same-store portfolio by 490 basis points from April 1 to June 30. Our same-store expenses declined 10 basis points sequentially and our same-store RevPAR declined 20 basis points year-over-year. The net result of the second quarter same-store NOI declining 24.5% from the previous year and 23.3% from the previous quarter. These results were collection of widespread admissions bans that were in place to most of the quarter the limited move-ins as well as extraordinary COVID-related expenses, totaling $34.2 million in the same-store portfolio, resulting in significant margin compression in the quarter. As a reminder, we\u2019re not normalizing any of these COVID-related costs for same-store. Looking forward to the third quarter and starting with the July data we\u2019ve already observed, we experienced 70 basis point declines in occupancy in July from start to finish. And we expect to finish third quarter, approximately 125 basis points to 175 basis points lower than we ended the second quarter. We expect overall show expenses remained relatively flat sequentially if continued reductions in COVID-related spend will be offset by increased costs relating to reopening of communities, seasonal utility costs and an increase in insurance costs. Now, in a capital market activity. In June, we issued a $600 million unsecured bond with a ten and a half year tender at 2.75%. And as Tom mentioned the lowest tenure coupon in the company\u2019s history. We\u2019re able to tender for $425 million of our two outstanding 2023 bonds increasing the way to the average years of maturity to 9.2 years were unsecured bond borrowings and further de-risking maturities through 2023. Following these tender activities, which closed in July, we have approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and the full capacity of our undrawn $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, totaling $4.3 billion of near-term liquidity as of July 31. Moving to investment activity. In the second quarter, we invested $124 million, almost entirely in our development pipeline. On the disposition front, we completed $949 million of pro rata dispositions at a 5.7% cap rate. Post quarter-end, we closed the second tranche of the MOB portfolio sale we announced nearly, with proceeds of $173 million at a 5.4% yield. And we expect the third and final tranche closed in the third quarter for $89 million of additional proceeds at a 5.3% yield. Shankh will speak to you later on, we feel very good about liquidity for all property types in our high-quality portfolio and view our private cost of capital, a significantly better price than our public costs at this current time. As of a result of these successful dispositions in the quarter, we ended the quarter 6.36 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, a 43 basis point increase in the last quarter, despite and approximately 13.5% decline sequential EBITDA. COVID is substantially increased variants in our near-term EBITDA, and consequently, we\u2019ve done everything in our control to counter that and maintain a strong cash flow based leverage profile despite our currently depressed property level cash flows. We\u2019ve also been acutely focused on managing what is in our control to maximize retention of cash through this pandemic. This has been focused on three main areas, G&A, CapEx and the dividend. On G&A, we expect to finish the year between $125 million and $130 million of corporate G&A, implying a run rate of a little over $30 million a quarter for the remainder of the year and representing a $10 million plus decrease what we\u2019d initially guided to for the year. For CapEx, we reduced CapEx spend by $12 million or 18% sequentially with our growing liquidity profile and our buildings opening back up, we expect fund to increase over the next two quarters, but still expect to finish the year approximately 16% below, where 2019 levels work. And as we announced last quarter, our dividend reduction, which has created approximately $110 million of quarterly cash flow savings. Results of these actions along with many others was that we were able to retain a significant cash flow before investment activity, despite the substantial negative impact of COVID-19 had on our second quarter results. While these decisions, particularly, the dividend decisions were difficult, we felt strongly that they gave us greater control as we navigate through the pandemic. retaining cash flow is by design difficult than the reconstruct. So, when analyzing near-term impact of COVID-19 on our cash flows, it was not just analysis of when we might return to breakeven levels of cash flow. There\u2019s a question of how long that deficit would last and the time it would take will retain cash flow to reach a level that allows for the accumulations of that deficit to be repaid i.e. today\u2019s dividends would need to be paid with tomorrow\u2019s cash flows. as a duration of the deficit period increases, its compounding impact on the deficit repayment needed to return the balance sheet to pre-COVID levels. Ultimately, this has a dual impact of not only amplifying business strains caused by the pandemic, but also be stabilized in the balance sheet. disposing of assets or selling equity offset this increased leverage, only increased the payout deficit by either eliminating any cash flow from disposed assets or adding dividend paying shares to our share count. our asset sales this quarter demonstrated by reducing the dividend to a level below current cash flows was made by our management team. As we were able to make a decision to sell assets based solely upon the value received and the stabilizing effect to these retained proceeds have had in our balance sheet. We believe these decisions ever moved dependent on a quick recovery, allowing us to decrease downside risk, they continue to make capital allocation decisions with a long-term focus. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll now provide additional color on the operating performance that Tim discussed and discuss our capital allocation strategy in this challenging yet rapidly evolving times. As we reflect back on the frenzied pace of activity over the last few months, our focus has been and will continue to be the safety of our residents and staffs in our communities. frontline heroes of these communities have done a tremendous job of improving the safety and quality of the life of the residents from the earliest days of this crisis. For example, in our SHO portfolio reported resident COVID cases over a trailing two-week period peaked at 510 cases in the first week of may. And since then, down to 98 cases, we\u2019re presenting 80% decline from the peak. This is despite the fact that our operators tested nearly 100,000 residents and employees so far. while COVID cases of spite across the nation, the prevalence of cases across our portfolio has remained relatively flat so far. COVID-related deaths, which peaked during the last week of April are down 92% since then and have so far remained relatively stable in July despite its spike in nationwide cases. This remarkable improvement though far from being completed, has allowed our operating partners to cautiously open doors to new prospects. In the last week of April, 42% of our communities had official admissions ban. That number today is 5% including 3% partial events. moving down sequentially from pre-COVID February peak to April when you had the first full month of COVID by almost 77%, since then, moving that up 174% from April low to the July. move-outs are peaked in March and sequentially, down 37% in July, relative to March. However, we still have more move-outs than move-ins. As a result of this, occupancy loss in our shop business has narrowed from down 60 basis points during the last week of April and first week of Maya to down 10 basis points each of last three weeks. though this improvement is encouraging, we are cautious about the overall environment as spike in COVID cases in our markets are real and they can impact our communities at any time. We have been seeing a steady increase of leads, inquiries, and deposits due to that need-driven nature of our business. The total number of leads in the system, which declined 55% from February to April trough since bounced back 60% in June, from that trough, it is approaching pre-COVID February numbers in July. However, move-ins are trailing as those leading activities due to the hesitation in the psychology of the consumers as the juggle between the difficulty of taking care of the elderly loved ones and the fear related to national headlines are rising COVID cases. So far, we have been positively surprised by our operating partners\u2019 ability to scale expenses to a rapidly declined in occupancy so far. We saw rates held up slightly better than what we thought in assisted living and memory care segment, which is up 1.7%. the occupancy was hit much more pronounced here down 6.2% year-over-year. While occupancy of our IL segment held up relatively better down 2% year-over-year, rate growth declined 10 basis points year-over-year. Additionally, the entrant of a lower price point senior as apartment portfolio to same-store pool in Q2 impacted the world mix, reducing total report at same-store RevPAR growth by 40 basis points for the quarter. Clearly, given how COVID had spread, the larger coastal markets have been impacted significantly during the quarter more than other markets. Finally, we\u2019re starting to see some differentiations in operator performance that can be explained by operator value-add, not just location, product type or acuity. As I mentioned last quarter, correlation pattern completely broke down in March and April, and we are happy to see it improving through June and July. on capital allocation front, we discussed in last quarter earnings call, two distinct mental models, short-term defense and long-term offense. We are glad to inform you that during the quarter, we have largely completed our efforts on the defensive side and have now shifted our focus on the offense. We\u2019re extraordinarily proud of our execution during the second quarter in both public and private markets. And it is important to remember and understand these two are one interconnected set of decisions and not distinct action. For example, our exceptional execution with Dave and his team at Kayne Anderson in record time with our senior housing and MOB portfolio disposition along with our execution to secure a term loan with our banking partners, both took place during the dark days of March. This gave us confidence to be patient in accessing public bond markets rather than issuing bonds when credit spread, where that peaks. if we were to issue bonds during those days, we would be looking at coupons close to 5%, not 2.75% that we issued later in the quarter that would have come at a cost to shareholders of $130 million over the life of the bond. We believe our execution in private markets peak to the significant demand of stabilized assets, both in senior housing and medical office asset classes. We\u2019re in the middle of other transactions that are premature to discuss at this point. But needless to say, we feel very strongly about the demand of our assets. More to come as we progress for the year. notably, this robust interest and pricing, and nowhere to be found in assets that are not in the middle of the fairway, such as those deals with broken capital structure, suboptimal operators, development and lease-up assets or generation handover of companies and assets to name a few. Fundamentals determined cash flow and asset price is a multiple of that same cash flow. These variables are usually inversely correlated with opportunities to invest at the highest moment of uncertainty. In other words, when fundamentals are great, asset pricing is high, expected returns are low. When fundamentals are bad, asset pricing is low, expected returns are high. We\u2019re seeing that playing out in many parts of senior housing sector today. We\u2019re starting to see signs of distress across the spectrum of the issues I mentioned. these situations not only required capital, but they also required operators, who are otherwise overwhelmed with the demand of their time given what\u2019s happening within their communities, and that where we come in with our toolkit. At Welltower, we think our value proposition in three interrelated groups; capabilities, culture, and capital. we lead with our capability. We execute with our culture of partnerships and we get the ball across the finish lines through our ability to write resolute checks with unmatched speed and structural creativity. When we introduced our ideas through your business model to achieve better alignment with our operators, many of you asked if Welltower will be able to retain its cultural partnership, to which we responded the proof was in the pudding. We are seeing the proof today. We\u2019re working with our operating partners very closely in identifying assets in their backyards through our data analytics platform and tailor-made to their model based on size, acuity, vintage demographics, and psychographic criteria. This algorithmic approach narrows the opportunity set to a manageable number, which is filtered to succeed for our operating partners that dive in and help us underwrite. Our operators and deal teams that connect with the fellow operators and owners to run through our thoughts on pricing, our ability to close and execute on operator transfer agreement on an expedited basis. We are either getting a quick yes, and jumping on the executions, or we\u2019re getting a quick no, and moving up to the next opportunity. For example, one of our partners in Midwest, StoryPoint, we have identified 137 distinct communities in seven states that fit their criteria and we\u2019re going through the list of opportunities with the StoryPoint team one asset at a time. These days have more than 2,800 senior living properties that are humanly impossible to hone in on a practical basis. The job of the algorithm is to bring our partners and our deal teams to focus at the highest probability, last mile effort. We remain fundamental value investors. We\u2019re focused on bottom-up underwriting, basis relative to replacement costs and structural protection. In another example, we have our in-process of executing on three premium opportunities with our partner, Brandywine in extraordinary locations, such as Princeton, New Jersey and summit, New Jersey. In another example, we\u2019re proud to execute an extraordinary opportunity in Fishersville submarket of Brookline on an existing land and structure that used to be a college. the township and the people of Brookline has given us incredible support and zoning approval even during COVID-19 to create an iconic 160-unit senior living project, where underwriting several more transactions with Balfour in the home markets of Colorado, as well as a new home in Boston. I can cite many other examples with other operators, but I will retain those for future calls. but I hope you walk away from this call, understanding that we have never been more excited about the opportunity to invest capital in the senior housing space, because of the pricings that we are seeing. We are buying communities in our core California and New Jersey market for less than $200,000 unit while replacement costs in this location are in excess of $0.5 million a unit. targeting development or development plus returns without the majority of the development risk outside lease-up. We believe in this business long-term, we also understand the near-term is going to be uncertain and challenging. Please note that uniqueness of this very challenge is what\u2019s creating a once-in-a-duration opportunity, right before the market they get upturn in the demand cycle. At the same time, the supply is coming to a screeching halt. Many of you, who follow NIC data have seen stocks are down to Q1 of 2009 level and we\u2019re likely to see this trend continue. construction activity across all real estate asset classes is down significantly, which is creating softness in soft and hard costs. Land prices are starting to show cracks as well. In this environment, we\u2019re standing by our operating partner, shoulder-to-shoulder when tourist capital is fleeing the space. And that is attracting more and more operator and development partners to Welltower, highly taking the proof in the relationship pudding. I am optimistic we\u2019ll be able to create significant value for a long-term shareholder in next 18 months to 24 months by allocating smart capital, leveraging our operating platform. With that, over to you Tom.\nTom DeRosa: Thanks, Shankh. Before we begin the Q&A session, I wanted to call your attention to a press release from last week, announcing the appointment of Diana Reid to our board of directors. Diana is an accomplished and highly-respected executive with 38 years of experience across the financial services and commercial real estate industries. She most recently served as executive Vice President of the PNC Financial Services Group and executive of the bank\u2019s commercial real estate business. She\u2019s also held leadership positions in many prominent organizations, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, Commercial Real Estate Finance Council, the Urban Land Institute and Real Estate Roundtable. All of Welltower\u2019s stakeholders will benefit from Diana\u2019s extensive experience and insights and we are extremely fortunate to have someone of her caliber join our board. I\u2019m also pleased by the fact that with Diana\u2019s appointment, 88% of our independent directors are women and minorities. As I\u2019ve said in the past, the diversity of our employee base, our leadership team and our board continue to be a priority at Welltower. This is not only a key component of good governance, but it is a proven driver of higher returns to shareholders. And with that, I will turn the mic back to Galen to open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning. I guess both Tom and Shankh, you guys spent a fair amount of time talking about the investment opportunities and Tom, it sounds like you alluded to some other potential sales coming down the pike, I guess. How do we sort of think about or way \u2013 the sale of assets that may be stabilized and Shankh, it sounds like you\u2019re looking at buying some broken assets and just sort of the dilution short-term versus kind of the long-term gain and the high growth and maybe, the high IRR potential, is there just \u2013 is there a sort of an amount of short-term dilution you\u2019re willing to take to get long-term growth out of these transactions?\nShankh Mitra: Steve, that\u2019s a very good question. If you think through at least sort of the mental model that we have, we are fundamentally looking to sell at this point assets that we think achieve pre-COVID pricing or pre-COVID IRR if we have sold those days. Our need for liquidity that we had obviously, or what we wanted to achieve in March is all now achieved at this point. So, we are looking for releasing capital from assets that we think is a testament of that long-term value. With that, we\u2019re looking to buy assets or deploy capital, whether that\u2019s assets or any other evitable opportunities such as our stock, unless we think there\u2019s a substantially higher IRR that can be achieved. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. We are long-term value investors and we are not focused on quarter-to-quarter dilution as you might have noted that the sale that we executed in the quarter had $0.02 of dilution in the quarter, but we still think that achieved extraordinary pricing as well as value for the shareholders.\nTom DeRosa: But Steve, I\u2019d add that we\u2019re not sellers underdressed. There are many quality sources of capital, institution investors that see the long-term value of this space and are very interested if there\u2019s an opportunity to buy high-quality assets from us or partner in a joint venture structure with us. So, there are very active dialogues going on and that\u2019s why I mentioned, you should expect more of this as the year progresses, there\u2019s \u2013 I definitely want to say that definitively, but we\u2019re pretty optimistic at this point.\nSteve Sakwa: Thank you.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bilerman: Thanks. It\u2019s in Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Maybe, spend some a little bit time talking about the senior housing operating environment and whether you\u2019re seeing any differences in-between the operators of their pricing strategies, whether some are using concessions versus some are holding rates, just how different operators, just like different healthcare REITs are approaching the market in different ways. I assume your operators are as well. So, if you can go through that. that would be helpful. Thank you.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So, we are obviously, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are seeing different strategies, but sort of \u2013 more I will just describe that as a tweaking of pricing strategies than a wholesale changing pricing. We believe that we provide an exceptional value to customers and for which, we need to attract a certain level of staffing for what you need pricing. So, we\u2019re not interested in compromising on that pricing or rather compromised on occupancy. So, if you look at, as I mentioned, our assisted living and memory care portfolio, RevPAR was up 1.7% even during this quarter. Now, if you think about as you lose occupancy and you were not building occupancy, you lose community fees. That obviously impacts that number in a pretty meaningful way. However, we\u2019re not seeing any decrease of like-to-like pricing in our communities. just the reported number, Michael was impacted by bringing the lower pricing or lower price points in his apartment into the pool. If you exclude that we would have reported a RevPAR increase of 20 basis points \u2013 increase of 20 basis points relative to flat, what Tim described last call.\nTim McHugh: I would just add to that, from Shankh\u2019s, point at this point, who you\u2019re seeing move-in, as you\u2019ve seen move-in to pick up are really going to be your most needs-based resident. So, the value proposition from high-quality care, which \u2013 and then reputation, which is where our operators sit within these markets, has probably never been higher. So, there could be a point when things actually start to pick up and you see the incremental demand come back, where pricing comes into that equation. Just given where \u2013 how suboptimal occupancy is across most markets. But at this point, pricing is in what\u2019s driving incremental occupancy, it\u2019s not driving the marginal customer and it\u2019s truly, really a needs-based client that\u2019s coming in.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, obviously, you\u2019ve got a commitment long term senior housing. I wonder and Shankh to you, I understand you\u2019re not a seller unless you can get obviously, reasonable price pre-COVID value in IRR and all the rest. but how would you characterize the future from an asset allocation perspective for Welltower and in light of a skilled nursing and post-acute assets and medical office, could \u2013 if you had your way, you got the pricing that you wanted, because senior housing, almost is the entire story here, five or 10 years from now, or is it more just growth at senior housing and you\u2019ll continue to maintain some exposure to those other asset classes.\nShankh Mitra: So rich, as we have mentioned in, pretty much every call, our asset allocation is strategy, or really a capital allocation strategy is driven by price. in the scenario that, which you described that every asset class that we play in, remains perfectly over priced for rest of 10 years and senior housing remains perfectly underpriced for next 10 years, then yes, the description that you gave that is possible, that is rarely how things happen, obviously, right? In moments of opportunity in the \u2013 when you see in capital markets, where capital comes in and out of a sector for various reasons, you see these moments of opportunity, and that\u2019s what we believe we\u2019re seeing. So near-term capital allocation, you will \u2013 obviously, you\u2019re going to see a significant increase in senior housing, but we love all of our asset classes. We love, like we love all of our children. There\u2019s no question that we want \u2013 we remain interested in playing all different asset classes. Our incremental capital allocation strategy is a function of price, not function of love for one asset versus other. Right now today, we have never seen a better opportunity to invest in senior housing as an asset class.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. please go ahead.\nJonathan Hughes: Hey, good morning. My question is on the rate outlook and you did touch on it a bit in Michael\u2019s question earlier, but I was hoping you\u2019d share some thoughts on the trajectory or reception of rate increases in a world, where amenities I\u2019ve been taken away from residents. Of course, they\u2019ve been taken away for their safety, but the social interaction aspect is what attracts a lot of residents to these properties and that might not be back to normal for some time. So, how does this removal of this socioeconomic factor and impact the rates your operators are able to achieve today for both new residents and existing resident rate increases? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Jonathan, that is a great question, which is why you are seeing the lower acuity models, where the need of providing healthcare and social determinants of health is lower. You are seeing rates not as pronounced rate increases with \u2013 as we have described to you that we saw a slight decrease of rate. on the other hand, where the social aspect of business is very important, social aspect of the living is very important, but more important is taking care of other health issues; obviously that\u2019s where it\u2019s increased the rate. So, it\u2019s an interplay between all aspects of the services that we provide, where you have more need driven, obviously residents, they will have less impact on rates in this kind of environment, where you have more lifestyle-driven residents, you will see more impact over it, just because of what you just described.\nTom DeRosa: Right. Jonathan, that\u2019s what I said earlier. our portfolio is skewed towards the higher acuity. So, these are truly people that are moving in, in this environment, have really exhausted other options. So, the social part of the senior housing model is not as important to them. They need to make sure that these seniors are getting their daily care. They can\u2019t \u2013 that cannot be done in \u2013 by many families today in the world we\u2019re living in, it becomes impossible, particularly if someone has dementia. So that is the profile generally of who is moving in today. They\u2019re not as concerned about the social aspects of the senior living model, but as things start to come back to normal that once again, will become a more important attribute to the consumer. But today, it\u2019s really all about safety and care.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Yes, thanks. Shankh or Tom, can you talk a little bit about how the second COVID wave or maybe, the continuation of that first COVID wave has impacted your operators? I guess, particularly in California, had they been forced to re-shutdown or delay reopening some of those facilities or what\u2019s the thought process behind that?\nShankh Mitra: That\u2019s a really, really good question. Frankly, I\u2019m extremely encouraged and positively surprised by the example, you just brought it up in your course. I was going to use that. California is probably, the only place, where you can see there\u2019s a true second wave, right. There\u2019s a lot of other states, where you\u2019re seeing sort of the first big wave. I\u2019m happy to tell you, this is why I was so encouraged by the performance of last three weeks. We haven\u2019t seen significant admissions ban or lack of performance in California in last three weeks, that really surprised me. We reported as you can see in our presentation sort of 10 basis points of occupancy decreasing last three weeks, those are obviously rounded numbers, Mike, but if you just followed the real numbers, they were down 14 basis points, down 10 basis points; and last week, it was down 7 basis points. given California \u2013 Southern California is our largest market. Given California is obviously impact to those numbers. You would have seen a much, much worse \u2013 and a worsening impact, not an incrementally better numbers going forward.\nTom DeRosa: Mike, I wanted to add to that. I\u2019m not going to name the operator, but there\u2019s one operator in particular, who was very quick to shut the door during the first wave in California. And what I would tell you is in the second wave, they are taking new residents. So, they are needed to adjust to this COVID environment and they did that by really \u2013 by effectively shutting down. And now, when COVID back there, they are in a position to safely admit new residents. They have the right protocols and procedures in place that are enabling them to again, meet the demand for this quality of care in a residential setting in markets, where the headlines are pretty scary. but I think that\u2019s a good indicator and it helps us explain some of the stats that you see in our deck. Why the number of cases are not spiking in our portfolio like they had back in April and may when one of the operators were blindsided, not just our operators. I mean, we all were blindsided by COVID. And so again, this could change Mike, but it\u2019s an interesting \u2013 California is an interesting data point for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the investment cadence. within the context of what\u2019s going on with cash flows and leverage. Are you guys better to buy or to sell right now? In other words, will sales and purchases be more balanced here going forward and offset one another in terms of volume?\nShankh Mitra: No. Well, I cannot sit here and tell you that I know or have any idea. I will only tell you that depended on one thing and that\u2019s price, and expected return out of those buy and sell. If we find the opportunity to deploy capital that at an extraordinary basis, and return we\u2019ll buy more. And if we think that we\u2019re better off selling, because the market is providing us great value for our assets that sort of seize through these uncertain times, then we\u2019ll sell. on a practical basis, there\u2019s going to be a combination of both, obviously as you think through how assets \u2013 how debt gets re-priced, eventually the stress to debt service coverage, how that stress is obviously, equity. It takes time, but we\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing already seeing today. But I cannot tell sitting here on any given quarter, how those sales forces buy volumes, whether they will sort of cancel each other, one will be higher than each other. I can tell you that. it\u2019s just purely price dependent.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. maybe, both for Tom and shankh, you\u2019ve obviously talked a lot about exciting acquisition opportunities across the spectrum, more so seniors housing. I\u2019m just wondering seniors housing specific, can you talk about those opportunities in context of kind of geographies, meaning the UK and Canada as well, product type, IL, AL and then maybe, even something that you\u2019ve talked about in the past, the affordable product. So, what are you looking at in terms of potentially getting a little bit more aggressive on, in terms of building the portfolio from here?\nTom DeRosa: So Vikram, we\u2019re looking at opportunities across the board, all three countries obviously, just given the population and a number of product, we\u2019re seeing more opportunities in U.S., distress or rather more favorable pricing. So far, we see across the board, not necessarily one product diverse is other, but probably more in high, high acuity and AL memory care. probably, there is more distress, because you saw the occupancy fall the most in that. And that\u2019s pretty much I can tell you, we\u2019re seeing, as I mentioned, we\u2019re seeing across the coast; East Coast, West coast, we\u2019re seeing extraordinary \u2013 we have seen some extraordinary pricing in both coasts. We\u2019re seeing a lot of opportunities in the Midwest. We\u2019re seeing opportunities in Texas. We are in it, our deal team, which is our legal team, our investment teams, and all the teams that support them have never been busier. but whether we will be able to what we execute on will be a function of, as I said, price and needs to be reflective of the environment that we find ourselves today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Mizuho. please go ahead.\nTayo Okusanya: Yes. good morning, everyone. So, I just wanted to focus a little bit on the comments around the improvement in the \u2013 well, improvement in the rate of decline, as it pertains to occupancy in senior housing, again, clear that most of your facilities are open. It sounds like, virtual tours and things are happening, but can you just talk a little bit more about why that slowdown is actually either occurring. The ability of the directors of these buildings to still kind of get move-in traffic despite COVID or whatever have you.\nTom DeRosa: Yes. So, I think we touched on this, Tayo, a little bit. but as we can think about our portfolio, primarily our U.S. and UK portfolio, it\u2019s high acuity, it\u2019s a need-driven portfolio, right. So there is again \u2013 you can only push off this demand so much. So we\u2019re seeing, as I mentioned that just if you think about leading indicators that just take leads. And I mentioned those in my prepared remarks, you saw a rapid decline of lead a pre-COVID first month, last month of pre-COVID is February, a significant decline, 55% decline, sort of to the trough of may and April. And by June, it was up 60%; in July, it\u2019s now actually \u2013 in month of July, it\u2019s approached the pre-COVID numbers of February, but if you kind of peel back the onion and you will see, there are the majority of the people are more need-driven than just lifestyle-driven. And just \u2013 that\u2019s due to the fact that they can only push off the need that much into the future. So that\u2019s why we think we\u2019re seeing it. The other thing I will tell you, we have given you the absolute number, not just a percentage of number of what is going on in a community from the perspective of COVID. I hope you think given how large our portfolio is. how many units available versus the number of people in the COVID, which we mentioned 98 cases, that is a remarkable testament to the quality of care, that\u2019s provided by our operators in those places and that reputation does matter. And that you cannot say the same thing about the industry as a whole. but our operating partners have that reputation that delivering on that reputation and that\u2019s what attracting new residents.\nShankh Mitra: One of the things I\u2019m going to add to that Tayo is the decision has changed today, it\u2019s \u2013 can you \u2013 number one, is their COVID in the building. Can you take my mother or father? Are you able to take them in what \u2013 how are you going to protect them? And can you meet their needs? That is the decision chain today, because so many people have exhausted their ability to care for that relative and have been in many cases; in many markets, they\u2019ve had no options, but just to take care of them at home or in their home and if you think about it, a lot of these residents or incoming residents, their lifestyle is being shut into a room in a house, or they\u2019re living by themselves in an apartment with some limited, either family care or home healthcare. So, in a sense, the lifestyle component doesn\u2019t change too much for that individual, except there\u2019s much more security and consistency around their care program then can be achieved in a conventional hall unless you\u2019re extremely wealthy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kim: Thanks. Good morning. So, your operating diversification is a positive for your company performance, but when you look at some of the larger tenants and the sequential decline, looking at a sunrise or Rivera, they\u2019re pretty significant underperformers within your portfolio. I\u2019m not sure if you can comment on these operators specifically or if not overall, the ability for some of your private pay senior housing operators and their ability to handle this kind of performance in the absence of government assistance.\nTom DeRosa: Before Shankh gives you an answer, this is that the operators just point out, this has been in place in a while, being annualized the quarter. And so sequential changes are just more pronounced. So, you\u2019re taking the entire sequential change and you\u2019re multiplying it by four to get to that in-place NOI number.\nShankh Mitra: But regardless, John, you make a point, there\u2019s no question that some of our higher acuity operators have definitely underperform. And if you add high acuity with coastal locations, that is definitely some \u2013 in some operators, we have some significant performance decline. But that is why you have a diversified portfolio, right, without getting into very specific names. But if you follow through the coastal market and then you add acuity where we saw the most decline, it is not difficult to find out who would have performed relatively better or worse. But as Tim pointed out, that you should not take one quarter when NOI declines staggering 25%, if you multiply by that four, you\u2019re going to get very, very different results.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. So, I just wanted to turn back to the move-in issue. So, I mean, move-ins have improved, but they\u2019re still down 45% in July versus last year. And so I guess, I\u2019m wondering, do you have any data on why customers or delaying move-ins, and particularly if you have any feel for the timeframe of that delay or people telling you, they just want to wait three months, they\u2019re going to wait a year, they\u2019re going to wait until there\u2019s a vaccine. And I guess, I know you talked about leads, but it would be helpful to understand instead if you had any sort of backlog of deposits, you can point to? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: First is, let me answer your second part of your question. Deposit activity is extraordinarily strong. As I pointed out the move-ins activity, which has been obviously improved, pretty meaningfully is not matching the deposit activity as people are spreading out their moving dates. That\u2019s what I think you\u2019re asking about. And I pointed out in my prepared remarks. I think the other part of your question was, is move-ins down from last year? Absolutely it is. If you think about what we are trying to get to at least what most analysts and investors asking, they\u2019re trying to get to a point understand the run rate earnings power of the company. Sequential gives you that year-over-year is a function of what happened yesterday. Sequential gives you what is going to happen tomorrow. And I think that\u2019s what sort of, we are personally with here to figure out the exact same answer anyway. What is our run rate EBITDA? But is move-in down from last year? There\u2019s no question. Of course, you see, we have lost 500 basis points occupancy in one quarter. So, you are not at the same level of activity and it is going to take some time to come back to the same level of activity.\nTom DeRosa: Nick, I want to add something to that, what you see is people are, as Shankh mentioned, the deposit activities is good. The movements are delayed. What\u2019s the way that move-in, I think was your question. In some cases it\u2019s you \u2013 if I can\u2019t visit right now on a regular basis, I can\u2019t visit mom or dad on a regular basis. I\u2019m going to wait till there\u2019s some visitation \u2013 safe visitation model before I moved them in. So, they\u2019ve secured a place, but they\u2019re delaying until perhaps there\u2019s some again, we\u2019ve seen visitation allowed in many States and again, under very strict protocols. In some cases, in some States, it\u2019s the testing. It\u2019s bad. I don\u2019t want my mom to be tested, to be poked and prodded twice a week. So, I\u2019m going to wait until that settles down. So it\u2019s elements like that. These are people that need to come in. They\u2019ve secured a place with a deposit, but they\u2019re waiting to the conditions might meet their needs a bit better if the situation isn\u2019t desperate, like I need today; I need to move my dad today. I cannot take care of him anymore in the situation he\u2019s in. So, it\u2019s individual, it\u2019s specific to the family and the individual, but it\u2019s, things like that that are causing that delay.\nShankh Mitra: And Nick, that\u2019s why we\u2019re not giving you our best guess scenario, our best guess that occupants will be up next quarter, right? Given the amount of activity and demand that we see in the system, you would think that, just from that, we will be indicating that occupancy will be up. We\u2019re not, because we wanted to see that hesitation. So it gets at least for next three months, we want to see how that plays out before we tell you that we feel that the consumers are coming back in-house. We\u2019re not saying that we want to see how that plays out.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Thanks for the question, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m curious on operator expenses going forward. There obviously was a lot of extra COVID costs. What should we kind of look for in 3Q and maybe the ability for labor to flex as occupancy has come down in marketing budgets, that\u2019d be really helpful. Thanks.\nTom DeRosa: Yes. Josh, I think the way I thinking about that is, just with the quarter looking at kind of COVID costs, the biggest piece of it, if you think about COVID costs and roughly call 20% of that kind of PPE and cleaning. And that is likely going to be around until you have a vaccine or the pandemic has come down a lot. In saying that, I\u2019d say the cost of PPE still likely inflated. So, the cost of requiring has come down quite a bit from the certainly March April area, but it\u2019s still in many years, probably two x to three x, or it should be when supply chains can and completely kind of normalized, but just speaking, the kind of current pricing, if PPE cleaning makeup about 20% of that, and there\u2019s a piece of it then that is kind of dietary and that diet therapies pieces from delivering meals to rooms, instead of running, the common or communal dining areas that will start to come down as you see some normalization of internal activities. And then lastly, the labor piece. And labor piece makes up the large majority of the cost here. And the labor piece, actually, it\u2019s probably fair to think about in our \u2013 the deck we put out last night, we\u2019ve got a, our trailing two-week COVID cases. And you see they peak on May 8, and that\u2019s actually probably a very good indicator of when our labor costs are tied to COVID peak. So, April and May both have pretty high COVID related labor costs. It came down considerably into June, that\u2019ll burn off obviously dependent on the pandemic and the prevalence of COVID-19 in our facilities. But as that come down, that labor piece is almost burned off entirely at this point. So, going forward, it gets \u2013 it\u2019s right to think about just that kind of PPE and cleaning costs being a dominant force and then labor will be dependent on the actual prevalence of the virus.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteve Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, Tom and Shankh and Tim.\nTom DeRosa: Good morning.\nSteve Valiquette: A couple of questions here. One, do you, I mean, you touched on this a little bit already, but just that comment on a Slide 17 at the recent rise in COVID cases may result in near term increases as admission bans. And it sounds like your operators are now generally want to be on the offensive on move-ins. I guess, if there are a potential new admission bans, that sounds like they would be more mandated by state government, as opposed to voluntary bans, so I just want to make sure that we\u2019re taking them out that the right way? And then maybe the bigger question overall, Shankh, you kind of touched on this for 3Q, but the way it stands right now is that your expectation that in calendar 2020, that Welltower will cross the threshold and shop where the move-ins will exceed, move-outs. So the occupancy will start to increase at some point this year, or is that still up in the air right now the way it stands, just want to get clarity around the calendar 2020 thoughts around that? Thanks.\nTim McHugh: Thanks, Steve. It\u2019s Tim. I\u2019ll start with your question on move-in bans, and then Shankh can answer your second question. I think I just kind of re categorize your comment on our operators being on any offensive. I think our operators being very smart about the way that they\u2019re admitting residents. And I think you\u2019re correct in what we\u2019ll call it kind of outright admissions bans and Tom kind of made this point about California with one of our operators that kind of voluntarily moved to admissions bans in first wave, the second wave they\u2019re admitting presidents. But certainly the admission protocol is extremely heightened. And that gets a little bit Tom\u2019s point on even some of the hitting of that protocol being part of the reason why you\u2019re not seeing people choose to move-in. But I think part of what we\u2019ve seen so far is, as you\u2019ve seen the cases spiked nationally again, you\u2019ve seen cases within our facilities move-up, but stay very controlled and start to come back down the last two weeks. And I think that\u2019s actually, it\u2019s symbolic of the admissions protocol working very well. So, do I think, the actual admissions bans you\u2019re correct, that will be driven more so by probably state and local municipalities. And then obviously the building itself when there is an actual case of COVID, but the building, the operators themselves, I think, are just being very cautious about admitting. So, that\u2019s playing a role here. But the actual bans will be more driven by governing bodies.\nShankh Mitra: Steve, to your second question, do we \u2013 are we here to sit down and predict when move-in and move-out across the world will absolutely not. You tell us how you think COVID will play out, and we\u2019ll tell you how that will transition to a numbers. We\u2019re only telling you what we have seen until yesterday. We\u2019re not going to sit here and predict what might happen tomorrow given the uncertainty of this environment. We\u2019re encouraged by what we have seen. We\u2019re also obviously telling you that we\u2019re very cautious, that things can change anytime. So, we\u2019ll obviously not going to sit here and predict when those two will across the world. But we haven\u2019t \u2013 we are very, very encouraged that it can very close last week.\nTom DeRosa: Yes. And the one thing we do know, Steve, is that the operators, know what they\u2019re dealing with today. In March, April, May, they were again trying to figure out what was happening and we\u2019re unprepared as we all were. So, I think that the positive today is that they do have the right policies, procedures in place to manage a very difficult situation, but things can change on a dime. So again, reiterating why we\u2019re not being \u2013 looking, try to predict what\u2019s going to happen through the rest of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lukas Hartwich from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.\nLukas Hartwich: Thanks. There\u2019s a lot of focus on the potential for government support for senior housing here in the U.S. I was hoping you could provide some color on that discussion in Canada and the UK?\nTom DeRosa: Well, in the UK, it\u2019s a very different story, Lukas. This \u2013 there is much government support for the senior housing industry in the UK. And unlike in the U.S. it did not become a target of hysteria around COVID, what\u2019s interesting in the UK, the frontline workers in the senior care business are considered heroes like the people who work in hospitals. In the United States that\u2019s not the case. And that\u2019s a shame, because the healthcare workers in the senior living in post-acute care spaces have been subject to the same conditions that as healthcare workers in hospitals they faced a lot of the same challenges, and like our healthcare workers in hospitals they\u2019re doing the best they can to meet the needs of their population. So, I\u2019m hoping that will change in the U.S. But in the UK, it\u2019s a different and there\u2019s certainly more government support for the senior living industry in the UK. In Canada, remember, our business, is really more of an independent living business. The higher acuity models in Canada are government provided. So today, I can\u2019t comment on government support in Canada coming into the independent living model \u2013 into the independent living sector, I really couldn\u2019t comment on that. They\u2019re both, obviously both countries are having very different healthcare system than the United States.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Bernstein: Good morning. Quick question. When we look back at 2009, average entrance change went up, acuity went up, margins went down, length of stay went down. When you\u2019re looking at the opportunities that I sound generational, how are you thinking about the underwriting of the long-term fundamentals of the business? I know that may be very difficult, but are you concerned about maybe the long-term upside of the NOI, the business is a little bit lower going forward then it\u2019s has been in the past? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Dan, I am not only concerned, I\u2019m paranoid about everything that changes investment returns. So that\u2019s why, in this uncertain environment, the price needs to reflect that uncertainty, right? But I do think the industry is coming to a point where you can underwrite different scenarios and then price that in, at the end of the day, we deploy capital to make money for our shareholders. There\u2019s no guaranteed return. If we wanted guaranteed return, we\u2019ll be buying government bonds. But we do think that, today, as opposed to 90 days ago, one sector is reaching a point where you can underwrite, and you can price in uncertainties of the various things that you mentioned. So, we\u2019ll see how it plays out, but we do believe that at the end of the day, if the revenue characteristic, the cash flow characteristics, not just revenue, the cash flow characteristic of an asset comes down. What we\u2019ll do with that will depress returns and obviously that means that will depress future development, if there\u2019s no returns developers will not chase the assets and ultimately demand and supply will balance. That is true for any capital intensive business, so, will not be any different here as well. But you\u2019re raising some very, very good points and we are not only concerned. We\u2019re also paranoid about those things, and we\u2019re trying to do the best we can from top down sort of data analytics approach to bottom up, value investing approach and I sort of described on my prepared remarks, however, bringing those together.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah Tan from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSarah Tan: Hi, this is Sarah on from Mike Muller, one question on my end. How much of your Triple-Net revenues are at risk [indiscernible]? Could you comment on that?\nShankh Mitra: Sarah. Can you say that, how much of the Triple-Net rent? I couldn\u2019t hear the last part.\nSarah Tan: How much of your \u2013 what portion of your Triple-Net revenues are risk for rent reset?\nShankh Mitra: I think, Sarah, you said how much of our rents are at risk of a rent reset?\nSarah Tan: Yes, that\u2019s right. For the Triple-Net revenues.\nTim McHugh: Yes. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, the Triple-Net business and senior housing in two different structures. And so that wins have been felt by every day business, there\u2019s certainly being felt on the Triple-Net side. There\u2019s some differences given the different product mix in location, but what I said, last quarter and more repeat again, is that the economics long-term have to support the rents. And I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked about a lot on calls the last three years. Did we restructured a lot of these rents and got ahead of some of this is that operators see the long-term opportunities asset class, and want to remain in these buildings and in control of the buildings. And so the thought of there being kind of a rent reset based just on current economics, I think is somewhat misplaced. So, and you look at rent collection and it remains very strong in this space as well. So, I think in general there\u2019s no \u2013 we\u2019re not here to say that the economics underlying these properties been challenged and there will be certainly conversations around how the economics and the rent a line and we were prepared to have those. But at this time, I think the best we can do is continue to see where rents go and flush and stay high and we\u2019ll continue to observe that and report to the market.\nShankh Mitra: And Sarah, as you think through, we\u2019re not obviously going to speculate, but as Tim talked about it, that\u2019s how we think about it. As you think through our numbers and try to get to your best guess, just remember our reported numbers still include a very large tenant that we have already restructured and announced to the street, which is Capital Senior. That\u2019s already still in those numbers there will be out the next two quarters, but that has already happened.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Mizuho Capital. Please go ahead.\nTayo Okusanya: Hi, just a quick follow-up on the health systems platform. Can you just help us understand that this point, I\u2019m going, there\u2019s a lot going on in skilled nursing and government funding, but could you just help us understand specifically what you\u2019d expect to kind of happen next from a government funding perspective? What you\u2019re kind of hearing also from the States about Medicaid funding? Just given all their budgets are pretty stretched right now, because of the whole COVID issue?\nShankh Mitra: Yeah. So, Tayo, we\u2019re reading the same things that you\u2019re reading. This is inappropriate for us to speculate on what additional government funding might be or might not be coming to this space. So, we\u2019ll just leave that for future discussions. But we\u2019re encouraged by the support that post-acute industry has seen so far.\nTayo Okusanya: What about on the state that was just given a lot of them are setting the budgets right now? Are you kind of hearing anything of any feedback that you set to next have a good sense of what the Medicaid funding would look like?\nShankh Mitra: Thank you for trying Tayo, I\u2019ll remain the same answer that it is an inappropriate venue for us to speculate on the future state government action as well.\nOperator: Thank you. I show no further questions in the queue at this time. This concludes our Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom DeRosa",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these difficult times. When we last spoke with you in early May, Welltower was in the midst of the most challenging period in the company's history. Many of our senior housing and post-acute care operators had implemented admissions bans to prevent or control the spread of COVID within their communities. Critical personal protective equipment and testing kits were difficult to procure and labor challenges left many of our operators short-staffed. However, I am pleased to report that significant progress has been made on all of these fronts. And that most of our properties have reopened with appropriate staffing levels and requisite PPE and testing kits. This was accomplished through careful planning and precautionary measures taken by our operators. In fact, in just a few months, 95% of our senior housing operating communities are now accepting new residents. And this is significant, because our communities are a critical component to the care continuum. It is imperative that seniors have access to residential settings, in which professional care is offered to meet their everyday needs, including safety, nutrition, hygiene, and medication management. It is important to remember that this is a need-driven asset class. Welltower's traditional assisted living portfolio is skewed towards higher acuity settings, which are built for seniors, who have exhausted the ability to be cared for in a conventional home setting. We continue to owe a debt of gratitude to the frontline workers in all of our properties, who braved extraordinary obstacles to put the care of their residents above all house. While I'm encouraged by our progress, by no means are we signaling the all clear. We are acutely aware of the heightened level of risk, which continues to exist, particularly at the number of COVID cases in the U.S., continues to rise. As Shankh and Tim will describe in greater detail, the toll from COVID on our business has been and will continue to be pronounced. However, the decisions we have made since the beginning of the pandemic and the steps we have taken over the past five years to strengthen our enterprise have put us in a position to weather this storm. These decisions while often difficult are rooted in data and always executed with the long-term interest of our shareholders in mind. This management team has earned a reputation for taking on both opportunities and issues in a proactive manner and COVID-19 has not changed that. One of the strongest examples of this approach relates to our recent efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet. As financial conditions begin to \u2013 began to deteriorate at the outset of the pandemic. Our team did not panic. Instead through a thoughtful and deliberate process, we obtained a $1 billion term loan providing us with ample flexibility in the event of a prolonged market downturn. As conditions improved in subsequent months, our team waited for an opportune time at which to return to the public market. And in June, we issued $600 million of unsecured debt at just 2.75%, a lowest coupon on 10-year notes in Welltower's history. These actions are a reflection of Tim McHugh and his team's responsible stewardship of our balance sheet, and the confidence from investors and our banking partners in the Welltower platform. Another major achievement was the disposition of two large portfolios of seniors housing and outpatient medical assets with a combined total value of $1.3 billion. These sales were executed during a time in which few real estate assets traded and when the ability for senior housing to withstand the impact of COVID was called into question. Most notably, our $1 billion transaction with Kayne Anderson provided significant and immediate liquidity to Welltower in a period of under 45 days and was executed at valuation levels, which were only modestly below pre-COVID pricing. Again, we were not back into a corner to complete these deals. The valuation we achieved demonstrated the appreciation for the long-term growth prospects for healthcare real estate, by astute investors and the strong liquidity, which exists for our asset class. I applaud our investment teams for their perseverance in completing these deals under the most extenuating circumstances. As the year progresses, you should expect to see more of this. Following the completion of our capital markets activity and portfolio dispositions, our near-term liquidity stands at $4.3 billion. The company is extremely well-positioned to address all near-term capital obligations and its ample capacity to execute on accretive opportunities as they arise. Our team will continue to explore all avenues, through which to create value for our shareholders. And regardless of how strong our liquidity position is today; our underwriting discipline will not be compromised. Many questions were made on answered after the duration and ultimate impact of COVID-19. However, what we can say with great certainty is that the long-term drivers of our business remain firmly intact. The population is growing older. The need for value based healthcare is as important as ever and addressing social determinants of health will only grow in relevance. While it's often difficult to see past the next week or next quarter, rest assured that Welltower's long-term value proposition has not changed. There will be challenging times ahead, but we are confident that the company is positioned to navigate through these choppy waters and emerge as the continued leader in delivering the real estate that will enable more efficient and cost-effective healthcare and wellness. With that, I'll turn the mic to Tim. Thanks, Shankh. Before we begin the Q&A session, I wanted to call your attention to a press release from last week, announcing the appointment of Diana Reid to our board of directors. Diana is an accomplished and highly-respected executive with 38 years of experience across the financial services and commercial real estate industries. She most recently served as executive Vice President of the PNC Financial Services Group and executive of the bank's commercial real estate business. She's also held leadership positions in many prominent organizations, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, Commercial Real Estate Finance Council, the Urban Land Institute and Real Estate Roundtable. All of Welltower's stakeholders will benefit from Diana's extensive experience and insights and we are extremely fortunate to have someone of her caliber join our board. I'm also pleased by the fact that with Diana's appointment, 88% of our independent directors are women and minorities. As I've said in the past, the diversity of our employee base, our leadership team and our board continue to be a priority at Welltower. This is not only a key component of good governance, but it is a proven driver of higher returns to shareholders. And with that, I will turn the mic back to Galen to open up the line for your questions. But Steve, I'd add that we're not sellers underdressed. There are many quality sources of capital, institution investors that see the long-term value of this space and are very interested if there's an opportunity to buy high-quality assets from us or partner in a joint venture structure with us. So, there are very active dialogues going on and that's why I mentioned, you should expect more of this as the year progresses, there's \u2013 I definitely want to say that definitively, but we're pretty optimistic at this point. Right. Jonathan, that's what I said earlier. our portfolio is skewed towards the higher acuity. So, these are truly people that are moving in, in this environment, have really exhausted other options. So, the social part of the senior housing model is not as important to them. They need to make sure that these seniors are getting their daily care. They can't \u2013 that cannot be done in \u2013 by many families today in the world we're living in, it becomes impossible, particularly if someone has dementia. So that is the profile generally of who is moving in today. They're not as concerned about the social aspects of the senior living model, but as things start to come back to normal that once again, will become a more important attribute to the consumer. But today, it's really all about safety and care. Mike, I wanted to add to that. I'm not going to name the operator, but there's one operator in particular, who was very quick to shut the door during the first wave in California. And what I would tell you is in the second wave, they are taking new residents. So, they are needed to adjust to this COVID environment and they did that by really \u2013 by effectively shutting down. And now, when COVID back there, they are in a position to safely admit new residents. They have the right protocols and procedures in place that are enabling them to again, meet the demand for this quality of care in a residential setting in markets, where the headlines are pretty scary. but I think that's a good indicator and it helps us explain some of the stats that you see in our deck. Why the number of cases are not spiking in our portfolio like they had back in April and may when one of the operators were blindsided, not just our operators. I mean, we all were blindsided by COVID. And so again, this could change Mike, but it's an interesting \u2013 California is an interesting data point for us. So Vikram, we're looking at opportunities across the board, all three countries obviously, just given the population and a number of product, we're seeing more opportunities in U.S., distress or rather more favorable pricing. So far, we see across the board, not necessarily one product diverse is other, but probably more in high, high acuity and AL memory care. probably, there is more distress, because you saw the occupancy fall the most in that. And that's pretty much I can tell you, we're seeing, as I mentioned, we're seeing across the coast; East Coast, West coast, we're seeing extraordinary \u2013 we have seen some extraordinary pricing in both coasts. We're seeing a lot of opportunities in the Midwest. We're seeing opportunities in Texas. We are in it, our deal team, which is our legal team, our investment teams, and all the teams that support them have never been busier. but whether we will be able to what we execute on will be a function of, as I said, price and needs to be reflective of the environment that we find ourselves today. Yes. So, I think we touched on this, Tayo, a little bit. but as we can think about our portfolio, primarily our U.S. and UK portfolio, it's high acuity, it's a need-driven portfolio, right. So there is again \u2013 you can only push off this demand so much. So we're seeing, as I mentioned that just if you think about leading indicators that just take leads. And I mentioned those in my prepared remarks, you saw a rapid decline of lead a pre-COVID first month, last month of pre-COVID is February, a significant decline, 55% decline, sort of to the trough of may and April. And by June, it was up 60%; in July, it's now actually \u2013 in month of July, it's approached the pre-COVID numbers of February, but if you kind of peel back the onion and you will see, there are the majority of the people are more need-driven than just lifestyle-driven. And just \u2013 that's due to the fact that they can only push off the need that much into the future. So that's why we think we're seeing it. The other thing I will tell you, we have given you the absolute number, not just a percentage of number of what is going on in a community from the perspective of COVID. I hope you think given how large our portfolio is. how many units available versus the number of people in the COVID, which we mentioned 98 cases, that is a remarkable testament to the quality of care, that's provided by our operators in those places and that reputation does matter. And that you cannot say the same thing about the industry as a whole. but our operating partners have that reputation that delivering on that reputation and that's what attracting new residents. Before Shankh gives you an answer, this is that the operators just point out, this has been in place in a while, being annualized the quarter. And so sequential changes are just more pronounced. So, you're taking the entire sequential change and you're multiplying it by four to get to that in-place NOI number. Nick, I want to add something to that, what you see is people are, as Shankh mentioned, the deposit activities is good. The movements are delayed. What's the way that move-in, I think was your question. In some cases it's you \u2013 if I can't visit right now on a regular basis, I can't visit mom or dad on a regular basis. I'm going to wait till there's some visitation \u2013 safe visitation model before I moved them in. So, they've secured a place, but they're delaying until perhaps there's some again, we've seen visitation allowed in many States and again, under very strict protocols. In some cases, in some States, it's the testing. It's bad. I don't want my mom to be tested, to be poked and prodded twice a week. So, I'm going to wait until that settles down. So it's elements like that. These are people that need to come in. They've secured a place with a deposit, but they're waiting to the conditions might meet their needs a bit better if the situation isn't desperate, like I need today; I need to move my dad today. I cannot take care of him anymore in the situation he's in. So, it's individual, it's specific to the family and the individual, but it's, things like that that are causing that delay. Yes. Josh, I think the way I thinking about that is, just with the quarter looking at kind of COVID costs, the biggest piece of it, if you think about COVID costs and roughly call 20% of that kind of PPE and cleaning. And that is likely going to be around until you have a vaccine or the pandemic has come down a lot. In saying that, I'd say the cost of PPE still likely inflated. So, the cost of requiring has come down quite a bit from the certainly March April area, but it's still in many years, probably two x to three x, or it should be when supply chains can and completely kind of normalized, but just speaking, the kind of current pricing, if PPE cleaning makeup about 20% of that, and there's a piece of it then that is kind of dietary and that diet therapies pieces from delivering meals to rooms, instead of running, the common or communal dining areas that will start to come down as you see some normalization of internal activities. And then lastly, the labor piece. And labor piece makes up the large majority of the cost here. And the labor piece, actually, it's probably fair to think about in our \u2013 the deck we put out last night, we've got a, our trailing two-week COVID cases. And you see they peak on May 8, and that's actually probably a very good indicator of when our labor costs are tied to COVID peak. So, April and May both have pretty high COVID related labor costs. It came down considerably into June, that'll burn off obviously dependent on the pandemic and the prevalence of COVID-19 in our facilities. But as that come down, that labor piece is almost burned off entirely at this point. So, going forward, it gets \u2013 it's right to think about just that kind of PPE and cleaning costs being a dominant force and then labor will be dependent on the actual prevalence of the virus. Good morning. Yes. And the one thing we do know, Steve, is that the operators, know what they're dealing with today. In March, April, May, they were again trying to figure out what was happening and we're unprepared as we all were. So, I think that the positive today is that they do have the right policies, procedures in place to manage a very difficult situation, but things can change on a dime. So again, reiterating why we're not being \u2013 looking, try to predict what's going to happen through the rest of the year. Well, in the UK, it's a very different story, Lukas. This \u2013 there is much government support for the senior housing industry in the UK. And unlike in the U.S. it did not become a target of hysteria around COVID, what's interesting in the UK, the frontline workers in the senior care business are considered heroes like the people who work in hospitals. In the United States that's not the case. And that's a shame, because the healthcare workers in the senior living in post-acute care spaces have been subject to the same conditions that as healthcare workers in hospitals they faced a lot of the same challenges, and like our healthcare workers in hospitals they're doing the best they can to meet the needs of their population. So, I'm hoping that will change in the U.S. But in the UK, it's a different and there's certainly more government support for the senior living industry in the UK. In Canada, remember, our business, is really more of an independent living business. The higher acuity models in Canada are government provided. So today, I can't comment on government support in Canada coming into the independent living model \u2013 into the independent living sector, I really couldn't comment on that. They're both, obviously both countries are having very different healthcare system than the United States."

            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'll now provide additional color on the operating performance that Tim discussed and discuss our capital allocation strategy in this challenging yet rapidly evolving times. As we reflect back on the frenzied pace of activity over the last few months, our focus has been and will continue to be the safety of our residents and staffs in our communities. frontline heroes of these communities have done a tremendous job of improving the safety and quality of the life of the residents from the earliest days of this crisis. For example, in our SHO portfolio reported resident COVID cases over a trailing two-week period peaked at 510 cases in the first week of may. And since then, down to 98 cases, we're presenting 80% decline from the peak. This is despite the fact that our operators tested nearly 100,000 residents and employees so far. while COVID cases of spite across the nation, the prevalence of cases across our portfolio has remained relatively flat so far. COVID-related deaths, which peaked during the last week of April are down 92% since then and have so far remained relatively stable in July despite its spike in nationwide cases. This remarkable improvement though far from being completed, has allowed our operating partners to cautiously open doors to new prospects. In the last week of April, 42% of our communities had official admissions ban. That number today is 5% including 3% partial events. moving down sequentially from pre-COVID February peak to April when you had the first full month of COVID by almost 77%, since then, moving that up 174% from April low to the July. move-outs are peaked in March and sequentially, down 37% in July, relative to March. However, we still have more move-outs than move-ins. As a result of this, occupancy loss in our shop business has narrowed from down 60 basis points during the last week of April and first week of Maya to down 10 basis points each of last three weeks. though this improvement is encouraging, we are cautious about the overall environment as spike in COVID cases in our markets are real and they can impact our communities at any time. We have been seeing a steady increase of leads, inquiries, and deposits due to that need-driven nature of our business. The total number of leads in the system, which declined 55% from February to April trough since bounced back 60% in June, from that trough, it is approaching pre-COVID February numbers in July. However, move-ins are trailing as those leading activities due to the hesitation in the psychology of the consumers as the juggle between the difficulty of taking care of the elderly loved ones and the fear related to national headlines are rising COVID cases. So far, we have been positively surprised by our operating partners' ability to scale expenses to a rapidly declined in occupancy so far. We saw rates held up slightly better than what we thought in assisted living and memory care segment, which is up 1.7%. the occupancy was hit much more pronounced here down 6.2% year-over-year. While occupancy of our IL segment held up relatively better down 2% year-over-year, rate growth declined 10 basis points year-over-year. Additionally, the entrant of a lower price point senior as apartment portfolio to same-store pool in Q2 impacted the world mix, reducing total report at same-store RevPAR growth by 40 basis points for the quarter. Clearly, given how COVID had spread, the larger coastal markets have been impacted significantly during the quarter more than other markets. Finally, we're starting to see some differentiations in operator performance that can be explained by operator value-add, not just location, product type or acuity. As I mentioned last quarter, correlation pattern completely broke down in March and April, and we are happy to see it improving through June and July. on capital allocation front, we discussed in last quarter earnings call, two distinct mental models, short-term defense and long-term offense. We are glad to inform you that during the quarter, we have largely completed our efforts on the defensive side and have now shifted our focus on the offense. We're extraordinarily proud of our execution during the second quarter in both public and private markets. And it is important to remember and understand these two are one interconnected set of decisions and not distinct action. For example, our exceptional execution with Dave and his team at Kayne Anderson in record time with our senior housing and MOB portfolio disposition along with our execution to secure a term loan with our banking partners, both took place during the dark days of March. This gave us confidence to be patient in accessing public bond markets rather than issuing bonds when credit spread, where that peaks. if we were to issue bonds during those days, we would be looking at coupons close to 5%, not 2.75% that we issued later in the quarter that would have come at a cost to shareholders of $130 million over the life of the bond. We believe our execution in private markets peak to the significant demand of stabilized assets, both in senior housing and medical office asset classes. We're in the middle of other transactions that are premature to discuss at this point. But needless to say, we feel very strongly about the demand of our assets. More to come as we progress for the year. notably, this robust interest and pricing, and nowhere to be found in assets that are not in the middle of the fairway, such as those deals with broken capital structure, suboptimal operators, development and lease-up assets or generation handover of companies and assets to name a few. Fundamentals determined cash flow and asset price is a multiple of that same cash flow. These variables are usually inversely correlated with opportunities to invest at the highest moment of uncertainty. In other words, when fundamentals are great, asset pricing is high, expected returns are low. When fundamentals are bad, asset pricing is low, expected returns are high. We're seeing that playing out in many parts of senior housing sector today. We're starting to see signs of distress across the spectrum of the issues I mentioned. these situations not only required capital, but they also required operators, who are otherwise overwhelmed with the demand of their time given what's happening within their communities, and that where we come in with our toolkit. At Welltower, we think our value proposition in three interrelated groups; capabilities, culture, and capital. we lead with our capability. We execute with our culture of partnerships and we get the ball across the finish lines through our ability to write resolute checks with unmatched speed and structural creativity. When we introduced our ideas through your business model to achieve better alignment with our operators, many of you asked if Welltower will be able to retain its cultural partnership, to which we responded the proof was in the pudding. We are seeing the proof today. We're working with our operating partners very closely in identifying assets in their backyards through our data analytics platform and tailor-made to their model based on size, acuity, vintage demographics, and psychographic criteria. This algorithmic approach narrows the opportunity set to a manageable number, which is filtered to succeed for our operating partners that dive in and help us underwrite. Our operators and deal teams that connect with the fellow operators and owners to run through our thoughts on pricing, our ability to close and execute on operator transfer agreement on an expedited basis. We are either getting a quick yes, and jumping on the executions, or we're getting a quick no, and moving up to the next opportunity. For example, one of our partners in Midwest, StoryPoint, we have identified 137 distinct communities in seven states that fit their criteria and we're going through the list of opportunities with the StoryPoint team one asset at a time. These days have more than 2,800 senior living properties that are humanly impossible to hone in on a practical basis. The job of the algorithm is to bring our partners and our deal teams to focus at the highest probability, last mile effort. We remain fundamental value investors. We're focused on bottom-up underwriting, basis relative to replacement costs and structural protection. In another example, we have our in-process of executing on three premium opportunities with our partner, Brandywine in extraordinary locations, such as Princeton, New Jersey and summit, New Jersey. In another example, we're proud to execute an extraordinary opportunity in Fishersville submarket of Brookline on an existing land and structure that used to be a college. the township and the people of Brookline has given us incredible support and zoning approval even during COVID-19 to create an iconic 160-unit senior living project, where underwriting several more transactions with Balfour in the home markets of Colorado, as well as a new home in Boston. I can cite many other examples with other operators, but I will retain those for future calls. but I hope you walk away from this call, understanding that we have never been more excited about the opportunity to invest capital in the senior housing space, because of the pricings that we are seeing. We are buying communities in our core California and New Jersey market for less than $200,000 unit while replacement costs in this location are in excess of $0.5 million a unit. targeting development or development plus returns without the majority of the development risk outside lease-up. We believe in this business long-term, we also understand the near-term is going to be uncertain and challenging. Please note that uniqueness of this very challenge is what's creating a once-in-a-duration opportunity, right before the market they get upturn in the demand cycle. At the same time, the supply is coming to a screeching halt. Many of you, who follow NIC data have seen stocks are down to Q1 of 2009 level and we're likely to see this trend continue. construction activity across all real estate asset classes is down significantly, which is creating softness in soft and hard costs. Land prices are starting to show cracks as well. In this environment, we're standing by our operating partner, shoulder-to-shoulder when tourist capital is fleeing the space. And that is attracting more and more operator and development partners to Welltower, highly taking the proof in the relationship pudding. I am optimistic we'll be able to create significant value for a long-term shareholder in next 18 months to 24 months by allocating smart capital, leveraging our operating platform. With that, over to you Tom. Steve, that's a very good question. If you think through at least sort of the mental model that we have, we are fundamentally looking to sell at this point assets that we think achieve pre-COVID pricing or pre-COVID IRR if we have sold those days. Our need for liquidity that we had obviously, or what we wanted to achieve in March is all now achieved at this point. So, we are looking for releasing capital from assets that we think is a testament of that long-term value. With that, we're looking to buy assets or deploy capital, whether that's assets or any other evitable opportunities such as our stock, unless we think there's a substantially higher IRR that can be achieved. So that's how we're thinking about it. We are long-term value investors and we are not focused on quarter-to-quarter dilution as you might have noted that the sale that we executed in the quarter had $0.02 of dilution in the quarter, but we still think that achieved extraordinary pricing as well as value for the shareholders. Yes. So, we are obviously, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are seeing different strategies, but sort of \u2013 more I will just describe that as a tweaking of pricing strategies than a wholesale changing pricing. We believe that we provide an exceptional value to customers and for which, we need to attract a certain level of staffing for what you need pricing. So, we're not interested in compromising on that pricing or rather compromised on occupancy. So, if you look at, as I mentioned, our assisted living and memory care portfolio, RevPAR was up 1.7% even during this quarter. Now, if you think about as you lose occupancy and you were not building occupancy, you lose community fees. That obviously impacts that number in a pretty meaningful way. However, we're not seeing any decrease of like-to-like pricing in our communities. just the reported number, Michael was impacted by bringing the lower pricing or lower price points in his apartment into the pool. If you exclude that we would have reported a RevPAR increase of 20 basis points \u2013 increase of 20 basis points relative to flat, what Tim described last call. So rich, as we have mentioned in, pretty much every call, our asset allocation is strategy, or really a capital allocation strategy is driven by price. in the scenario that, which you described that every asset class that we play in, remains perfectly over priced for rest of 10 years and senior housing remains perfectly underpriced for next 10 years, then yes, the description that you gave that is possible, that is rarely how things happen, obviously, right? In moments of opportunity in the \u2013 when you see in capital markets, where capital comes in and out of a sector for various reasons, you see these moments of opportunity, and that's what we believe we're seeing. So near-term capital allocation, you will \u2013 obviously, you're going to see a significant increase in senior housing, but we love all of our asset classes. We love, like we love all of our children. There's no question that we want \u2013 we remain interested in playing all different asset classes. Our incremental capital allocation strategy is a function of price, not function of love for one asset versus other. Right now today, we have never seen a better opportunity to invest in senior housing as an asset class. Jonathan, that is a great question, which is why you are seeing the lower acuity models, where the need of providing healthcare and social determinants of health is lower. You are seeing rates not as pronounced rate increases with \u2013 as we have described to you that we saw a slight decrease of rate. on the other hand, where the social aspect of business is very important, social aspect of the living is very important, but more important is taking care of other health issues; obviously that's where it's increased the rate. So, it's an interplay between all aspects of the services that we provide, where you have more need driven, obviously residents, they will have less impact on rates in this kind of environment, where you have more lifestyle-driven residents, you will see more impact over it, just because of what you just described. That's a really, really good question. Frankly, I'm extremely encouraged and positively surprised by the example, you just brought it up in your course. I was going to use that. California is probably, the only place, where you can see there's a true second wave, right. There's a lot of other states, where you're seeing sort of the first big wave. I'm happy to tell you, this is why I was so encouraged by the performance of last three weeks. We haven't seen significant admissions ban or lack of performance in California in last three weeks, that really surprised me. We reported as you can see in our presentation sort of 10 basis points of occupancy decreasing last three weeks, those are obviously rounded numbers, Mike, but if you just followed the real numbers, they were down 14 basis points, down 10 basis points; and last week, it was down 7 basis points. given California \u2013 Southern California is our largest market. Given California is obviously impact to those numbers. You would have seen a much, much worse \u2013 and a worsening impact, not an incrementally better numbers going forward. No. Well, I cannot sit here and tell you that I know or have any idea. I will only tell you that depended on one thing and that's price, and expected return out of those buy and sell. If we find the opportunity to deploy capital that at an extraordinary basis, and return we'll buy more. And if we think that we're better off selling, because the market is providing us great value for our assets that sort of seize through these uncertain times, then we'll sell. on a practical basis, there's going to be a combination of both, obviously as you think through how assets \u2013 how debt gets re-priced, eventually the stress to debt service coverage, how that stress is obviously, equity. It takes time, but we're very encouraged by what we're seeing already seeing today. But I cannot tell sitting here on any given quarter, how those sales forces buy volumes, whether they will sort of cancel each other, one will be higher than each other. I can tell you that. it's just purely price dependent. One of the things I'm going to add to that Tayo is the decision has changed today, it's \u2013 can you \u2013 number one, is their COVID in the building. Can you take my mother or father? Are you able to take them in what \u2013 how are you going to protect them? And can you meet their needs? That is the decision chain today, because so many people have exhausted their ability to care for that relative and have been in many cases; in many markets, they've had no options, but just to take care of them at home or in their home and if you think about it, a lot of these residents or incoming residents, their lifestyle is being shut into a room in a house, or they're living by themselves in an apartment with some limited, either family care or home healthcare. So, in a sense, the lifestyle component doesn't change too much for that individual, except there's much more security and consistency around their care program then can be achieved in a conventional hall unless you're extremely wealthy. But regardless, John, you make a point, there's no question that some of our higher acuity operators have definitely underperform. And if you add high acuity with coastal locations, that is definitely some \u2013 in some operators, we have some significant performance decline. But that is why you have a diversified portfolio, right, without getting into very specific names. But if you follow through the coastal market and then you add acuity where we saw the most decline, it is not difficult to find out who would have performed relatively better or worse. But as Tim pointed out, that you should not take one quarter when NOI declines staggering 25%, if you multiply by that four, you're going to get very, very different results. First is, let me answer your second part of your question. Deposit activity is extraordinarily strong. As I pointed out the move-ins activity, which has been obviously improved, pretty meaningfully is not matching the deposit activity as people are spreading out their moving dates. That's what I think you're asking about. And I pointed out in my prepared remarks. I think the other part of your question was, is move-ins down from last year? Absolutely it is. If you think about what we are trying to get to at least what most analysts and investors asking, they're trying to get to a point understand the run rate earnings power of the company. Sequential gives you that year-over-year is a function of what happened yesterday. Sequential gives you what is going to happen tomorrow. And I think that's what sort of, we are personally with here to figure out the exact same answer anyway. What is our run rate EBITDA? But is move-in down from last year? There's no question. Of course, you see, we have lost 500 basis points occupancy in one quarter. So, you are not at the same level of activity and it is going to take some time to come back to the same level of activity. And Nick, that's why we're not giving you our best guess scenario, our best guess that occupants will be up next quarter, right? Given the amount of activity and demand that we see in the system, you would think that, just from that, we will be indicating that occupancy will be up. We're not, because we wanted to see that hesitation. So it gets at least for next three months, we want to see how that plays out before we tell you that we feel that the consumers are coming back in-house. We're not saying that we want to see how that plays out. Steve, to your second question, do we \u2013 are we here to sit down and predict when move-in and move-out across the world will absolutely not. You tell us how you think COVID will play out, and we'll tell you how that will transition to a numbers. We're only telling you what we have seen until yesterday. We're not going to sit here and predict what might happen tomorrow given the uncertainty of this environment. We're encouraged by what we have seen. We're also obviously telling you that we're very cautious, that things can change anytime. So, we'll obviously not going to sit here and predict when those two will across the world. But we haven't \u2013 we are very, very encouraged that it can very close last week. Dan, I am not only concerned, I'm paranoid about everything that changes investment returns. So that's why, in this uncertain environment, the price needs to reflect that uncertainty, right? But I do think the industry is coming to a point where you can underwrite different scenarios and then price that in, at the end of the day, we deploy capital to make money for our shareholders. There's no guaranteed return. If we wanted guaranteed return, we'll be buying government bonds. But we do think that, today, as opposed to 90 days ago, one sector is reaching a point where you can underwrite, and you can price in uncertainties of the various things that you mentioned. So, we'll see how it plays out, but we do believe that at the end of the day, if the revenue characteristic, the cash flow characteristics, not just revenue, the cash flow characteristic of an asset comes down. What we'll do with that will depress returns and obviously that means that will depress future development, if there's no returns developers will not chase the assets and ultimately demand and supply will balance. That is true for any capital intensive business, so, will not be any different here as well. But you're raising some very, very good points and we are not only concerned. We're also paranoid about those things, and we're trying to do the best we can from top down sort of data analytics approach to bottom up, value investing approach and I sort of described on my prepared remarks, however, bringing those together. Sarah. Can you say that, how much of the Triple-Net rent? I couldn't hear the last part. I think, Sarah, you said how much of our rents are at risk of a rent reset? And Sarah, as you think through, we're not obviously going to speculate, but as Tim talked about it, that's how we think about it. As you think through our numbers and try to get to your best guess, just remember our reported numbers still include a very large tenant that we have already restructured and announced to the street, which is Capital Senior. That's already still in those numbers there will be out the next two quarters, but that has already happened. Yeah. So, Tayo, we're reading the same things that you're reading. This is inappropriate for us to speculate on what additional government funding might be or might not be coming to this space. So, we'll just leave that for future discussions. But we're encouraged by the support that post-acute industry has seen so far. Thank you for trying Tayo, I'll remain the same answer that it is an inappropriate venue for us to speculate on the future state government action as well."

            "name": "Tim McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2020 results. The impact of COVID-19 in our business observed this quarter, our capital activity in the quarter, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update. In second quarter, Welltower reported normalized FFO of $0.86 per diluted share. These results include a total of $37 million or approximately $0.09 per share of property level costs in our senior housing operating portfolio associated with COVID-19 pandemic. As we indicated last quarter, Welltower is elected to not normalize these COVID-related expenses both normalized FFO and same-store results. Now, turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our Triple-Net portfolios. As a reminder, our Triple-Net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported quarter in arrears. These statistics reflect the trailing 12-months ending 3/31/2020, and therefore, only reflect a partial impact in COVID-19. In the quarter, we collected 98% of cash rents due on these portfolios and as of last night's release; we've collected 97% of cash rents due in July, which is in-line with previous months' collections at this time. First, our Senior Housing Triple-Net portfolio delivered 1.4% positive year-over-year same-store growth, and the difficult comp combined with an increased bad debt drove growth below original expectations. Occupancy was down 50 basis points sequentially and EBITDAR coverage increased 0.01 turns on a sequential basis in this portfolio. Our Senior Housing Triple-Net operators have experienced similar headwinds as everyday operates during the second quarter and we expect these coverages and occupancy stats reflect that going forward. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generating positive 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth and EBITDAR coverage declined 0.04 times sequentially. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our HCR ManorCare joint venture with ProMedica, a NOI growth at positive 1.375% year-over-year and EBITDAR coverage declined one basis points sequentially to 2.13 times. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical portfolio delivered positive 1.8% same-store growth. As a significant year-over-year decrease in the parking revenue caused by national shelter in place orders during the quarter, along with an increase in bad debt accrual was slightly offset by better than expected tenant retention. New leasing lastly remains uneven as a result of COVID. The second quarter ran behind pre-COVID budget by 104,000 square feet, but the gap began had narrowed June and July with new leasing exceeding budget by 44,000 square feet in July. During the quarter reflecting approximately 87% of cash rents, while approving 12% of rents for two months deferral plan. With the slower than expected reopening of certain regions in our portfolio caused more deferrals in the May-June period and we anticipated when we reported our first quarter numbers, we are encouraged by the momentum in the rebounding tenant openings, they accelerated in the back half of June and July driving cash rent collections to 95% in July. We've also had strong deferred rent collection in June and July as our two-month deferral plans began repayment. We collected 96% of what was due over this period. We're extremely proud of the Welltower outpatient medical employees, both onsite and working from home, who have kept our platform running smoothly during these extraordinary times. Before viewing this quarter's senior housing operating portfolio results, I want to briefly summarize the outlook we provided back in May when it certainly was at its peak. At that time, our expectations were that occupancy would be down between 500 basis points to 600 basis points from April 1 through June 30. The RevPAR would be flat on a year-over-year basis that expenses would increase by 5% sequentially driven primarily by labor costs. Before turning to how things actually turned out in the quarter, I'd like to first point out that our same-store pool is now represented a 91% of our total senior housing operating NOI, this will continue to increase in the year-end. In the quarter, occupancy declined in our same-store portfolio by 490 basis points from April 1 to June 30. Our same-store expenses declined 10 basis points sequentially and our same-store RevPAR declined 20 basis points year-over-year. The net result of the second quarter same-store NOI declining 24.5% from the previous year and 23.3% from the previous quarter. These results were collection of widespread admissions bans that were in place to most of the quarter the limited move-ins as well as extraordinary COVID-related expenses, totaling $34.2 million in the same-store portfolio, resulting in significant margin compression in the quarter. As a reminder, we're not normalizing any of these COVID-related costs for same-store. Looking forward to the third quarter and starting with the July data we've already observed, we experienced 70 basis point declines in occupancy in July from start to finish. And we expect to finish third quarter, approximately 125 basis points to 175 basis points lower than we ended the second quarter. We expect overall show expenses remained relatively flat sequentially if continued reductions in COVID-related spend will be offset by increased costs relating to reopening of communities, seasonal utility costs and an increase in insurance costs. Now, in a capital market activity. In June, we issued a $600 million unsecured bond with a ten and a half year tender at 2.75%. And as Tom mentioned the lowest tenure coupon in the company's history. We're able to tender for $425 million of our two outstanding 2023 bonds increasing the way to the average years of maturity to 9.2 years were unsecured bond borrowings and further de-risking maturities through 2023. Following these tender activities, which closed in July, we have approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and the full capacity of our undrawn $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, totaling $4.3 billion of near-term liquidity as of July 31. Moving to investment activity. In the second quarter, we invested $124 million, almost entirely in our development pipeline. On the disposition front, we completed $949 million of pro rata dispositions at a 5.7% cap rate. Post quarter-end, we closed the second tranche of the MOB portfolio sale we announced nearly, with proceeds of $173 million at a 5.4% yield. And we expect the third and final tranche closed in the third quarter for $89 million of additional proceeds at a 5.3% yield. Shankh will speak to you later on, we feel very good about liquidity for all property types in our high-quality portfolio and view our private cost of capital, a significantly better price than our public costs at this current time. As of a result of these successful dispositions in the quarter, we ended the quarter 6.36 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, a 43 basis point increase in the last quarter, despite and approximately 13.5% decline sequential EBITDA. COVID is substantially increased variants in our near-term EBITDA, and consequently, we've done everything in our control to counter that and maintain a strong cash flow based leverage profile despite our currently depressed property level cash flows. We've also been acutely focused on managing what is in our control to maximize retention of cash through this pandemic. This has been focused on three main areas, G&A, CapEx and the dividend. On G&A, we expect to finish the year between $125 million and $130 million of corporate G&A, implying a run rate of a little over $30 million a quarter for the remainder of the year and representing a $10 million plus decrease what we'd initially guided to for the year. For CapEx, we reduced CapEx spend by $12 million or 18% sequentially with our growing liquidity profile and our buildings opening back up, we expect fund to increase over the next two quarters, but still expect to finish the year approximately 16% below, where 2019 levels work. And as we announced last quarter, our dividend reduction, which has created approximately $110 million of quarterly cash flow savings. Results of these actions along with many others was that we were able to retain a significant cash flow before investment activity, despite the substantial negative impact of COVID-19 had on our second quarter results. While these decisions, particularly, the dividend decisions were difficult, we felt strongly that they gave us greater control as we navigate through the pandemic. retaining cash flow is by design difficult than the reconstruct. So, when analyzing near-term impact of COVID-19 on our cash flows, it was not just analysis of when we might return to breakeven levels of cash flow. There's a question of how long that deficit would last and the time it would take will retain cash flow to reach a level that allows for the accumulations of that deficit to be repaid i.e. today's dividends would need to be paid with tomorrow's cash flows. as a duration of the deficit period increases, its compounding impact on the deficit repayment needed to return the balance sheet to pre-COVID levels. Ultimately, this has a dual impact of not only amplifying business strains caused by the pandemic, but also be stabilized in the balance sheet. disposing of assets or selling equity offset this increased leverage, only increased the payout deficit by either eliminating any cash flow from disposed assets or adding dividend paying shares to our share count. our asset sales this quarter demonstrated by reducing the dividend to a level below current cash flows was made by our management team. As we were able to make a decision to sell assets based solely upon the value received and the stabilizing effect to these retained proceeds have had in our balance sheet. We believe these decisions ever moved dependent on a quick recovery, allowing us to decrease downside risk, they continue to make capital allocation decisions with a long-term focus. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh. I would just add to that, from Shankh's, point at this point, who you're seeing move-in, as you've seen move-in to pick up are really going to be your most needs-based resident. So, the value proposition from high-quality care, which \u2013 and then reputation, which is where our operators sit within these markets, has probably never been higher. So, there could be a point when things actually start to pick up and you see the incremental demand come back, where pricing comes into that equation. Just given where \u2013 how suboptimal occupancy is across most markets. But at this point, pricing is in what's driving incremental occupancy, it's not driving the marginal customer and it's truly, really a needs-based client that's coming in. Thanks, Steve. It's Tim. I'll start with your question on move-in bans, and then Shankh can answer your second question. I think I just kind of re categorize your comment on our operators being on any offensive. I think our operators being very smart about the way that they're admitting residents. And I think you're correct in what we'll call it kind of outright admissions bans and Tom kind of made this point about California with one of our operators that kind of voluntarily moved to admissions bans in first wave, the second wave they're admitting presidents. But certainly the admission protocol is extremely heightened. And that gets a little bit Tom's point on even some of the hitting of that protocol being part of the reason why you're not seeing people choose to move-in. But I think part of what we've seen so far is, as you've seen the cases spiked nationally again, you've seen cases within our facilities move-up, but stay very controlled and start to come back down the last two weeks. And I think that's actually, it's symbolic of the admissions protocol working very well. So, do I think, the actual admissions bans you're correct, that will be driven more so by probably state and local municipalities. And then obviously the building itself when there is an actual case of COVID, but the building, the operators themselves, I think, are just being very cautious about admitting. So, that's playing a role here. But the actual bans will be more driven by governing bodies. Yes. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, the Triple-Net business and senior housing in two different structures. And so that wins have been felt by every day business, there's certainly being felt on the Triple-Net side. There's some differences given the different product mix in location, but what I said, last quarter and more repeat again, is that the economics long-term have to support the rents. And I think that's something we've talked about a lot on calls the last three years. Did we restructured a lot of these rents and got ahead of some of this is that operators see the long-term opportunities asset class, and want to remain in these buildings and in control of the buildings. And so the thought of there being kind of a rent reset based just on current economics, I think is somewhat misplaced. So, and you look at rent collection and it remains very strong in this space as well. So, I think in general there's no \u2013 we're not here to say that the economics underlying these properties been challenged and there will be certainly conversations around how the economics and the rent a line and we were prepared to have those. But at this time, I think the best we can do is continue to see where rents go and flush and stay high and we'll continue to observe that and report to the market."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q1 2020 Welltower Inc. Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on-mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I\u2019d now like to hand the call over to Mr. Matt McQueen, Senior Vice President of General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatt McQueen: Thank you, Andrea and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tom for his remarks. Tom.\nTom DeRosa: Thanks, Matt. Good morning. I'd first like to say that I hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I know many of us have been directly impacted by COVID-19 and all of us have been indirectly impacted in some way which is having an overwhelming effect in shaping everything we are experiencing during this extraordinary period. Seniors with multiple chronic conditions who populate our senior housing property are vulnerable to any virus or infection and particularly affected by COVID-19. Historically our operators have implemented time-tested protocols for flu and inflection control that have proven to mitigate the impact of prior influenza outbreaks. However, we now know that COVID-19 is not an influenza outbreak but has become a global pandemic. Further we have learned our society's ability to slow the spread of COVID-19 rests solely with social distancing measures, given the lack of vaccines or drug therapies. The high level of personal care delivered to senior living residents combined with the fact that COVID-19 can be spread by asymptomatic residents, family members and care staff has resulted in many challenges for our operators. As Shankh and Tim will describe, our business had a strong start to the year but starting in mid-March data began to show that the growing impact of COVID-19 would make this performance not sustainable. In an effort to maintain transparency regarding our business, we have issued regular updates, which have provided context for declines in occupancy we started to see in late March that have continued through April. Given the tremendous uncertainty we face from the business model build to own real estate that enables the health and wellness needs of vulnerable seniors to be met in residential settings, this morning's call will be more focused on steps we are taking to manage this uncertainty. As Tim will discuss, we acted quickly to bolster our liquidity position. We also took numerous steps to help support our senior housing operators, health system, post-acute care and medical office tenants through this unprecedented period. For example, in March, we started to source and distribute much needed personal protective equipment or PPE for many of our operators and tenants who could not access for example, masks, gloves, gowns and testing kits. These efforts have helped our operators and tenants to better protect their staffs and residents. This is not what a REIT typically does. But extraordinary measures are often needed in extraordinary times like these. We told you in March that we would use data to guide all decisions regarding our business. Therefore, occupancy declines within our senior housing operating portfolio, a continual increase in operator expenses due to staffing and the cost of PPE, rent deferment requests from medical office tenants and the impacts of a sharp decline in elective surgeries combined \u2013 contributed to our decision to withdraw our 2020 guidance on April 17. There is much outside of our control, but we are taking steps to manage what is within our control. After a successful program to reduce overall G&A spend over the past three years, we believe we can lower G&A expenses this year by approximately $10 million to $15 million on an annualized basis by reducing compensation and non-compensation expenses. Additionally, at this point, we believe that it would not be prudent to pay 100% of our dividend, until we have more clarity regarding our cash flow for the year. So we've decided to pay 70% of our pre-COVID dividend. This was also a data-driven decision but it was by no means an easy decision. But we believe this is in the best long-term interests of our shareholders. Virtually overnight, COVID-19 has meaningfully impacted our business and changed our near-term objectives. However, we remain committed to our long-term strategy of being an important platform and real estate partner for constituents across the health care continuum to enable them to more effectively achieve the goals of value-based health care. Critical to our strategy is to focus on ensuring that the social determinants of health are met for all populations and especially for vulnerable populations like seniors. Since we began to shelter in place, even the most resilient people have experienced challenges with basic social determinants, such as sourcing groceries, medication and isolation and loneliness. Residential care concepts like senior housing allow these much needed activities of daily living to be delivered in consistent, supportive, efficient, and cost-effective ways. This is why we believe in the long-term viability of this business. When COVID-19 is a bad memory, we will still need to meet the health and wellness needs of a rapidly aging population and to reimagine and develop a more sustainable health care delivery infrastructure. That being said, we believe we are taking the necessary steps to navigate this uncertain environment and withstand the volatility presented by this pandemic so that we can meet this mission. And with that, I will turn this over to Tim McHugh who will take us through the financials. Tim?\nTim McHugh: Thank you, Tom. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2020 results. The early impact of COVID-19 and our tenants observed within the quarter and into April. And finally, a capital activity and balance sheet update. As a reminder to everyone on the call, Welltower removed all components of full year guidance in mid-April, after reviewing our first month of financial results with the impact of COVID-19. We believe the extent of COVID-19's impact on our portfolio will depend on many factors. We cannot accurately predict the future implications this pandemic will have in our business trends at this time. Although, there is no assurance that we are currently experiencing peak impact as it pertains to both our business or the broader economy, we are hopeful that we are moving through the period of peak uncertainty. And as that uncertainty diminishes, we'll be able to provide you more clarity on our outlook. Moving to the quarter, Welltower reported normalized FFO of $1.02 per diluted share for the first quarter. These results included a total of $7 million or approximately $0.02 per diluted share of unanticipated property level costs in our senior housing operating portfolio, associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Welltower is elected to not normalize these COVID-related expenses from both FFO and same-store results. Now turning to our individual portfolio of components. First, our Seniors Housing Triple-Net portfolio delivered 3% year-over-year same-store growth and both occupancy and EBITDAR coverages were flat on a sequential basis. As a reminder, our Triple-Net lease portfolio operating stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2019 and therefore do not reflect any impact in COVID-19. We expect our Seniors Housing Triple-Net operators to experience similar headwinds as everyday operators during the second quarter. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated 2.6% year-over-year same-store growth. And EBITDAR coverage declined by three basis points sequentially. On to health systems which is comprised of our joint venture with ProMedica. As indicated on last quarter's call, EBITDAR growth was strong in the fourth quarter in this portfolio and subsequently rent coverage improved eight basis points sequentially to 2.14 times. Rent collection across our Triple-Net segments including seniors housing, long-term post-acute and health systems was consistent with the historical in the first quarter. In April, we have collected 97% of total rents due. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical portfolio had another consistent quarter delivering 2.1% same-store growth. Our rent collection was in line with historical norms in the first quarter and in April we collected or approved rent deferral on 95% of our rent due. Early on in the pandemic, we are in active discussions with our tenants that were most impacted by the considerable slowdown in the facilities-based revenue streams, most significantly elected procedures. We focused on providing 60-day deferrals spanning April and May and as a result of these discussions, we've approved approximately 8% of our monthly rents for two-month deferral plans with payback periods within calendar year 2020. As of today, we believe approximately 25% of these deferrals, we brought current in the near term as tenants received financial support and see operations begin to open back up. Lastly, our Seniors Housing operating portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI declined 1.6% in the quarter. A stronger-than-expected first two months of the year were more than offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on both March occupancy and expenses with approximately 5.2 million of unanticipated expenses occurring in the property level within our same-store pool. As a reminder, we did not normalize COVID-related expenses out of our same-store metrics. Turning to April and as highlighted in our business update presentation released alongside our earnings last night, we experienced an acceleration in the occupancy pressures that began in March, as total portfolio occupancy fell 240 basis points in the month of April versus a 70 basis point decline in March, driven primarily by a significant decrease in move-ins as outright admission bans became more common across our portfolio at the start of April. We expect these occupancy declines to continue throughout the second quarter with occupancy expected to decrease 500 to 600 basis points by June 30th. We intend to continue our periodic updates throughout the second quarter to help investors and analysts better understand these trends. Before turning to the balance sheet, I wanted to make one final point on same-store. As I alluded to last quarter and as shown in this morning's 10-Q, we have aligned our Q and K disclosures of same-store with our supplemental disclosures, but the only difference is being the normalizations that we detail on page 22 of our supplement consistent with historical disclosure practices. Now on to the balance sheet and capital activity. I want to move through these highlights in two distinct sections. First our balance sheet, focusing on both liquidity and leverage; and then capital spend as it pertains to investments, developments, CapEx, corporate overhead and lastly our dividend. Starting with capital market activity. In early March we obtained commitments for a two-year unsecured term loan of $1 billion bearing interest at LIBOR plus 120 with the right to further upsize the borrowed amount by $200 million. We've closed on this loan on April 1st and the loan will be drawn in the second quarter. During the quarter we issued approximately two million shares via our DRIP and ATM forward programs at a weighted average price of $83.94 per share for estimated proceeds of $171 million. At the end of the quarter, we settled these in all prior forward sale agreements totaling 6.8 million shares and average price of $86.48 per share for $588 million of gross proceeds. The settlement of these forwards this brings Welltower's equity raise via DRIP and ATM since the start of 2019 to $1.7 billion at an average price of $80.64. Following these activities and as of May 4, we have approximately $2.36 billion of capacity under our $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, $1 billion of capacity under our undrawn term loan and cash and cash equivalents of $348 million, totaling just over $3.7 billion of liquidity with no unsecured debt maturities until 2023. Turning to leverage. We ended the quarter at 5.93 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 44 basis point sequential decrease from year-end. Although, we expect EBITDA to experience more bearing in the coming quarters due to the impact of COVID-19, we believe our leverage position entering this challenging period as well as our liquidity position will allow us to endure this period of uncertainty. Moving to capital spend and starting with investments. In the first quarter, we completed $398 million of acquisitions across four separate transactions at a blended yield of 5.6%. We have no further material acquisitions under contract for the remainder of 2020. On the disposition front, we completed $781 million of pro rata dispositions including $64 million related to a disposition of an unconsolidated equity investment during the quarter. We anticipate another $386 million of property sales during the remainder of the year including $121 million of sales and the final two tranches of our Invesco JV, the first of which closed in April for $74 million. Moving to development, we completed the $141 million of development spend in the quarter. We expect development spend of $463 million for the remainder of the year and then only $178 million of spend beyond 2020 to complete our current pipeline. The large majority of our development pipeline in the final stages of construction, we continue to view these developments as excellent uses of capital and as a medium-term source of natural deleveraging as they begin to produce cash flow over the next 24 months. Turning to capital spend on our existing portfolio. We anticipate reducing our CapEx by approximately $90 million from our initial budget for 2020. This will be accomplished from a combination of tighter restrictions and project work during the pandemic, deferred leasing capital on outpatient medical as leasing activity slows during the same period and also some delaying of larger capital projects across all asset types until we have more certainty around our outlook. Now on to corporate overhead. I first want to start by acknowledging the incredible work done across our organization over the past two months. We've spent considerable time over the last four years, focusing on lowering the run rate costs of managing our business on behalf of shareholders. Our core initiative in this pursuit has been the operational efficiencies gained through streamlining reporting systems. And although we certainly did not have this current pandemic in mind when we were designing these processes, it has certainly paid off as our accounting, FP&A, tax and treasury teams amongst many others have done a tremendous job keeping our organization functioning at a very high level while working from home. On the corporate overhead front, we've lowered our expectations for full year G&A to between $125 million to $130 million versus our prior guidance of $140 million. This reduction is being driven by expected reductions in management and incentive compensation, reduction in travel expenses and new hires and a minimization of all discretionary corporate spend. Lastly as announced in last night's earnings release, we have decided to reduce our quarterly dividend to 70% of our pre-COVID quarterly dividend levels, resulting in a $0.61 per share dividend declared last night. Given the uncertainty surrounding the short and long-term impact of COVID-19 in our business and the broader economy as a whole, we felt preserving liquidity by reducing our second quarter dividend to better match our near-term expectations of underlying cash flow was the most prudent way for us to maximize balance sheet stability as we navigate these unprecedented times. We expect to further evaluate our long-term dividend policy as the year progresses. And with that, I will hand the call over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I will comment on our operating environment and follow-up with our thoughts on capital allocation. When we last spoke with you on our Q4 earnings call, we had a bullish outlook for the business with a sharp portfolio gaining strength, our MOB portfolio retooled and executing on leasing and significant relationships with health systems were formed. In January and February, we delivered results that were ahead of this bullish outlook. And then with a flip of a switch our business changed in March due to COVID-19. If you pass through our Q1 sharp results, you will notice that despite the impact of COVID-19 in March, we still delivered a 3.6% same-store RevPAR growth for the quarter. That indicates to you how strong this year could have been if COVID-19 didn't happen. But COVID-19 did happen. And there is no question that our operating earnings will be considerably lower as a result. Densely populated coastal markets have consistently helped us to maintain strong pricing power in our shop business. Unfortunately many of these markets have also become hotspot for the virus. On the positive side, we are starting to see some relative stabilization in the Seattle area where pandemic has started. But on the other hand, we're seeing New York, New Jersey getting hit hard with no sign of stabilization just yet. There are three topics that are top of our minds as far as operations are concerned. Number one, resident safety and employee safety. This is the highest priority for us and our operators. Tom, discussed how swift actions we have taken on PPE side. Two, labor. In the short-term we're experiencing elevated expense levels as Tim described though we are encouraged by the expanded labor pools interest in our business as seniors housing is one of the few industries that is hiring today. And three, leasing velocity and occupancy. We have provided you the details of occupancy decline since COVID-19 breakout along the way through our business update. We lost approximately 70 basis points of occupancy in March, 240 basis points occupancy in April in our total SHO portfolio. Occupancy will continue to drop until our operators lift admissions ban. It is challenging to predict exactly when that will take place. I have discussed with you the details of our SHO portfolio construction and how portfolio's diversity of location, acuity, price point, et cetera results in lack of a correlated growth amongst our different operators. We have tested these models again and again and sensitized for business cycles and even debt supercycles. However, what we are faced with today is a once-in-a-century pandemic, which has led to a perfect storm of an entire economy effectively sheltered in place and a virus that disproportionately affects our frail senior population. The result is a closing of the front door of many of our communities across the portfolio. And with that our diversification benefit has been compromised. But we remain committed to our long-term strategy and portfolio construction. On the asset side, we cannot manage a portfolio for once-in-a-century black swan pandemic event that's why we maintained meaningful financial flexibility on the other side of the balance sheet in terms of liquidity, leverage, debt maturity, meaningful unused capacity of secured debt particularly those available from GSEs and CMHC, should we get asset mix wrong at a given moment in time. And in this context, let's not forget seniors housing is also a form of housing and has broader access to debt capital than most other forms of real estate. As we sit here today, we see a wide range of outcome both with the pandemic and with the economy. The range of outcome has somewhat narrowed on both of these areas as infection curve has started to flatten and the Federal Reserve's forceful intervention in late March has started the flow of credit again. The range of outcome still remains meaningfully wide and we will continue to maintain significant financial flexibility until we have further clarity. As Tom and Tim discussed, distributing out majority of our cash flow in this uncertain environment with a wide range of outcomes is not a prudent capital-allocation decision at this point in time. This retention of cash flow is obviously an extremely positive -- credit positive event in the near term, but we also think it will turn out to be a very positive outcome for our continuing shareholders as it puts us another step closer towards playing offense and helps us avoid dilutive capital raises that we have observed coming out of the last cycle. In the last two months, which feels like a lifetime now all of our capital-allocation activities can be thought in two distinct mental models; short-term defense and long-term offense. Short-term defense, we acted swiftly to arrange term loan to bolster our liquidity settled our forward equity program completed many in-process dispositions and pivoted away from our acquisition outlook. All of these actions were done with a view to respond defensively in a short -- really short period of time. We are working with our operating partners to fine-tune our CapEx spending for rest of the year working through our leases with tenants across all three lines of our businesses and executing our long-term business plan with different operators in certain select assets where it's appropriate. We're also contemplating a number of development -- we're also completing a number of development projects in 2020, which you know is the last year of our significant committed development spend. We're not done with this work stream by any means, but we made significant progress in this area of short-term defense. Long-term offense. This work stream is now under progress, but is by design behind the previous set of actions. We're focused on our portfolio both in terms of refinancing and recapitalization and starting to contemplate what opportunities might emerge for us to deploy capital. Asset values have clearly come down from pre-COVID levels. We just don't know to what extent yet. As we highlighted in our earnings release last night, a large seniors housing transaction that we discussed on our last call after the purchase and sale agreement was executed eventually did not close. The post-COVID world is more uncertain and we understand that people get cold feet. That near-term uncertainty has an impact on asset pricing. That is true for all the assets that we might be a buyer as well. We have always been price-sensitive and will continue to be even more so going forward. We remain excited about the prospects of our industry with a great demographic tailwind, especially in light of near-term supply which should decline substantially. Any incremental capital we deploy will be done after maintaining a sound balance sheet, ample liquidity and a laser-focused attention on price with a margin of safety. I would like to conclude by saying COVID-19 has created a very challenging backdrop for us. While we cannot control what happens to macro environment around us such as the pandemic, we can control how we respond to it. You as our shareholders, employ us as the managers of the business to make capital and resource-allocation decisions to create long-term value per share for continuing shareholders. We described the capital-allocation decisions we have taken so far and there are more to come. I hope our actions to prudently allocate resources to further bolster our cash flow by reducing G&A, a significant portion of which will come out of management compensation is a reflection of our alignment with you. This year has been a painful year for our shareholders and we are stepping in to share that pain with you. We ourselves are shareholders in the business and think of the stock we own as the ownership and partnership interest in the business that you all collectively own. We value this business on long-term occupancy cash flow and margin subject to a floor of replacement cost of the physical real estate not just to move around that gets valued and marked by -- marked every day by whoever wins the contest of exposure popularity or earnings prediction for the next quarter. Uncertain times are unsettling, but they create opportunity to create significant value for our shareholders over the long-term. With that, I'll pass back the mic to Tom. Tom? \nTom DeRosa: Thanks, Shankh. Before we open the line for questions, I just would like to say that I'm very fortunate to work with such a team of talented and dedicated individuals who are coming together during the harshest of circumstances. All of you know it's not easy to be working remotely and having a team that's used to being together and work remotely. Yet, the entire Welltower team has proven their commitment to our company's goals and are playing a critical role in our long-term success and I could not be more appreciative of their efforts. I'm happy to share with you this morning that our Board recently moved to recognize two of our most trusted leaders. As a result Shankh Mitra has been named Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer in addition to his role as Chief Investment Officer; and Tim McHugh has been named an Executive Vice President in addition to serving as Chief Financial Officer. Shank and Tim are being recognized for their intellect experience, broad internal and external leadership and dedication to Welltower. I'm extremely grateful and proud to work shoulder to shoulder albeit virtually now with both of them every day as we navigate Welltower through a period of great uncertainty toward brighter days ahead. So before we open for questions, I'd just like to say that we ask that you please limit your question to one question. And if you have another question to please jump back in the queue because a number of analysts have asked that we -- they may have to jump off the call a bit early because of the number of companies reporting today. So I ask you to please adhere to that. And with that -- and we'll stay on to answer all your questions. So, with that, I'll turn -- Andrea, you can open up the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Once again, for time sake, we are allowing one question and if there is a follow-up question, please reenter the queue. Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and the prepared remarks. When I look at the SHOW portfolio occupancy trends through May 1 and compare that to what you expect by end of June, it seems like things are expected to be less worse in May and June. But then in the slide deck you say, the number of communities that move-in restrictions is expected to rise. Can you just clarify these seemingly conflicting statements and maybe give any commentary on occupancy or expense trajectory beyond June assuming the trends do match what you're projecting for this month and next? Thanks.\nTom DeRosa: Jonathan, I'm going to have Shankh to answer that, but it's going to be -- it's very hard for us to predict anything beyond the second quarter. But, Shankh, why don't you jump in and give your thoughts?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So Jonathan, as you know that we are expecting 500 to 600 basis points of occupancy decline for the second quarter. And that should be seen with -- obviously, coupled with the comment that's right next to it, about our comments on pricing. So, obviously, those two are interrelated and should be seen as together. But, obviously, the fact is right now majority of our communities, almost half of it, is completely shut down from new admissions' perspective and others are, relatively speaking, behaving like they were shut down, at least in the month of April. We're starting to see billings or are at least starting to open up. Communities are starting to accept new residents or we're having conversations with where our operators are telling us that they're optimistic, their buildings will start to open, sometimes in May, sometimes in June. But I want to remind you, this is obviously a decision of our operators and it's taken at the ground level community by community. So we're telling you what we are hearing, but if we knew exactly what will happen, then we would not be taking the decision that we have taken with our dividend and with our guidance. So, understand there is significant uncertainty. And as we know more, we will, as Tim said, we will let you know more. But we're telling you what we are hearing from our operating partners.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. \nSteve Sakwa: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to try to understand a little more the dividend reset and how the $0.61 was maybe arrived. I'm just trying to figure out if that's tied to thinking about taxable net income in a specific way or how the SHOW portfolio may trend and whether there could be, maybe, a true-up dividend at the end of the year to get you to either taxable income or maybe even a further cut. I'm just trying to understand how the 30% was sort of arrived. \nTim McHugh: Yes, Steve. This is Tim here and I'll take that. So you're correct in thinking through this from the dividend, largely following taxable book income, as part of kind of REIT rules. Our view is that -- I mean, not our view, our expectation is that taxable book income will largely follow profitability. So there shouldn't be a large gap between what you see on the operating performance side and what ends up being kind of taxable income for the year. So you should think without getting too much into kind of how those two things might be slightly different within any given period, you should view the dividend cut is just being more a review on our -- on the management team view of where short-term cash flow's gone.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.\nVikram Malhotra: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess there's a lot of uncertainty on the SHOW side and I -- it's tough to predict out more than the quarter. But can you maybe give us some color on how you're viewing the Triple-Net portfolio? How underlying performance is relative to the SHO portfolio recently and the potential need there for restructurings?\nTim McHugh: Yes, Vikram. Tim here, again. I noted in my prepared remarks and what we -- how we're kind of thinking about that is Triple-Net or RIDEA is the same business in a different financial structure, right? And we've spent a lot of time talking about there being differences in our ability to control CapEx, various reasons why -- how our businesses evolve as we've become an owner of RIDEA properties in larger part versus Triple-Net properties. But the underlying businesses are largely the same. And the day-to-day business that goes in those facilities is the same. So we expect the performance of assets within the Triple-Net to be very similar to the RIDEA. Obviously, different according to different types of facilities, different geographies, et cetera. But our expectation is that, the Triple-Net fundamentals very much follow the fundamentals from RIDEA side. And as we kind of think about that in terms of how that impacts financials, I think the most conservative way to think about it is that long-term rents in any Triple-Net are going to follow the economics of the buildings. There's a lot more complexity to forecasting that than there's RIDEA where if we think about fundamentals and how they flow we'll see that go one-for-one into our financials. And I'll just say that we've been -- we mentioned rent collections in Seniors Housing Triple-Net to this point have been strong. And it continued to be even into May. And I think that we have not entered any deferral programs. We'll continue to update the market as we kind of think through that. But there will be I think some difference between kind of how those rent checks come in and underlying EBITDAR for some period of time. And it probably matters on the duration of weakness and the extent of it to how -- if any restructures occur how and when they occur.\nShankh Mitra: Vikram, I'll add a couple of -- two more points to that just to give you some more color. First is, our Triple-Net portfolio geographic obviously very different from obviously our SHO portfolio. And if you think about the biggest impact of where COVID happened is primarily coast to coast, right? So a lot of other markets obviously not similarly hit. But that will be one source of differentiation. The second source of differentiation as you know in the Triple-Net lease very simplistically speaking right your cost is relatively known to the landlord that you write a check and you collect every dollar of cash flow after that. So if you're an operator and you have collected every dollar of cash flow above that, you have intrinsically assumed that you have the risk both up and down. That is what the structure is. Now how we view some of these situations depending obviously on duration of the spending and the effect of the spending et cetera, but how we'll act will depend on what we think of you just as we did with the Triple-Net lease between Welltower and you how -- what is our thought on you as an operator? If you think that you're a good operator in your market and this is a pretty unfortunate event that happened for one time then we'll act one way. If you think that you are not a good operator and have never been a good operator or it's not -- we don't see eye to eye on how the business should go forward, then it will be hard for us to tell you the upside is yours and downside is all our shareholders. That's not how we think. And so, it is going to be a much more nuanced answer that will be based on case by case.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: I don't know if it was Tom or Shankh that you mentioned you don't run your business for 100-year century type event. But I guess with the mindset of what has occurred do you think about portfolio diversification in terms of the level of senior housing assets that you have both within SHO as well as net lease as a percentage of the total especially as -- especially on the IL side and much less need based than your skilled or your higher acuity assets. And whether you'd want to pursue a more broadly diversified health care portfolio that's more equal weighted across the number of different health care verticals and how does going through this experience even though it hasn't happened since the 1918 Spanish Flu. Does it change your perspective of how you want to have your diversification by health care type? \nTom DeRosa: That's a good question, Michael. Let me start off. Look we still believe that because of the aging of the population and because of the needs of a population seniors who are going to be living longer, we are still committed to models that bring those seniors together in settings that can better manage their needs whether they are less acute or more acute. So we -- while we are sitting at a moment in time that that is challenging that model, we think -- we don't think there's a better alternatives longer-term than putting seniors in environments where you hear me talk about this a lot. Their social determinant needs can be met effectively and cost efficiently. At the same time, we're opportunistic we're capital allocators and we look across all sectors of health care. I would say that prior to the last two-plus months you saw us making progress with a number of our health system initiatives, which would have started to bring in more diversification into our portfolio. Remember that the nation's health systems are thinking very differently about where they will provide their services in the future what different settings outside of the hospital. And many of them are aligned with us about settings that where they can better deliver services to seniors. So we're very much still committed to the senior business, because we think it has the biggest impact on the future of health care. Shankh, do you want to add anything to that?\nShankh Mitra: Yeah. Michael a couple of more granular points. First is the Welltower's portfolio is primarily a need based portfolio except \u2013 I mean, when I say U.S. our portfolio. Our U.S. and U.K. portfolio is primarily a need based portfolio. We have a couple of operating partners who are primarily independent living provider in the U.S., which we also think that in right markets with the right operator can be a very good business. But generally speaking our U.K. U.S. business \u2013 our U.S. and U.K. business are need-based business. Our independent living exposure that you're talking about is primarily a Canadian business. And we think that business is a very different business. We think that business is a housing alternative business and that will continue to do well. If you ask me today that where is the biggest opportunity as we see price aside you know that first thing we think about is price and we're a buyer of everything at a price. Price aside all things being equal I think there is no other real estate asset class that I know of that has a better opportunity to create long-term value than senior housing. So price aside if you told me that I have $1 to invest where would I invest on all health care asset classes given what the returns are going to be where total return investors I fundamentally think that will be senior housing. So if anything our exposure we'd like to take it up not down. Now, again that's the price aside comment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Hey, good morning and thanks for the color and commentary, tough times as we all know. My question is perhaps more big picture. I wonder, if you would at least be open to the possibility of a fundamental change in the back end of this particularly senior housing into skilled nursing where social distancing may be here to stay in some form and how that might manifest itself in the business longer term. Shankh your comments about no better asset class and perhaps that will prove to be a very reasonable observation longer term. But will there be an incremental frictional vacancy within the four walls of these asset classes? And are you giving that any thought or is it just too soon to know if there will be some sort of fundamental changes. It's hard to imagine we would go through all this and there's not going to be some fundamental change to how these businesses operate at the back end of all of this.\nTom DeRosa: Yeah. That's a fair question Rich. Look it's hard for us to make predictions right now based on what we've been dealing with in the pandemic. Well, I think that there will be fundamental changes in the service model and the asset positioning? Somewhat, I mean we were headed there particularly with technology companies. And I think there's going to be more new technologies that will enter senior living buildings that will essentially create tremendous efficiencies and mitigate some of the risks that we're seeing today due to an infection or a viral outbreak in buildings. I think it's very early to say if social distancing is going to be the way of a future. I mean that's a \u2013 if that's true if we're going to live in a world where we have to stand six feet apart from each other I think every business is going to be challenged and \u2013 but I'm hopeful that's not the future. I'm hopeful that we will get through this period and come back to the types of models that have been evolving to manage what is still one of the biggest demographic issues we've seen which is the aging of the population. And I also believe a health care system a health care delivery infrastructure that will have been compromised by this pandemic. And we already know that many leaders of health systems are thinking very differently about the setting in which they meet their constituencies. So, Rich it's very early to say. I'm hopeful we don't live in a world where we have to stand six feet apart from each other long term. Shankh you have anything to add.\nShankh Mitra: Yes Tom. Rich, if you think about we're always data dependent and if we're always open to the possibilities if that was your question we always are. If things change we will change. But I can tell you if you read the letters that we receive our operators receive and that they share with us sometimes we receive together about what our customers are saying and what we think is the pent-up demand for this business is we do not believe that's happening. If anything I'm not sure you saw -- or you read about Governor Cuomo's presentation yesterday. Majority of the people at least in New York where this data is published with COVID coming to hospitals are coming from homes. Only 4% of the people who are coming to New York hospitals are actually coming from assisted living. That tells you that our industry is doing something right. Now if things change we will change. But we believe that our operators and all of our people in the frontline are doing an amazing work to keep our residents safe. There's obviously no guarantee. Pandemic is everywhere. That's why it's called pandemic, right? But all seeing -- when that's all done when -- and as Tom said when COVID is a distant memory it might prove out to be the other way too. But we are always open to facts and we're always open to new possibilities.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.\nTodd Stender: Hi. Thanks, guys. I hope everyone is well\u2026\nShankh Mitra: Thanks, Todd\nTodd Stender: in Seattle. Thank you. In Seattle, Shankh you're seeing improvement or stabilization. However you characterized it. Is it occupancy? Is it prospects of move-ins, expense control? Just trying to get a sense of how close or far away you are from seeing any signs of improvement in the New York, New Jersey area. \nShankh Mitra: So Todd in Seattle in the beginning of this -- Seattle fell off the cliff at the beginning of this when we started giving you, obviously, all these updates. Occupancy was going down 90 basis points, 100 basis points a week. Now we are seeing occupancy is going down more like 30 basis points, 40 basis points a week something like that. So it is still going down. But obviously, the second derivative improved significantly. All I was pointing out on the other hand in New York, you have seen the infection curve has flattened and it's coming down. But it's sort of -- it's still pretty peak panic here. And obviously, all the states are not open yet. And when that happens, obviously, we'll see the impact on occupancy. But I was trying to drive, sort of, two distinction. It is purely a function of not only the psyche of the consumer, but also how safe our operators feel. I'll give you an example. One of our worst-performing market today is L.A. Southern California has been years- in years- out one of our best performing markets. And why is L.A. which is not as you think it's probably -- you don't think about L.A. today as sort of the most impacted COVID-impacted market. It is meaningfully impacted, but that's not sort of, what you call the eye of the storm. The reason being all of our operators have buildings admissions banned everywhere in Southern California in L.A. particularly. So it is a function of when our operators feel safe enough to open the buildings for new residents. And when that happens you will see occupancy will come back. It is hard to say when that will happen. I will give you some more color for you to think about. Four weeks ago, when we were seeing occupancies going down so let's call it 60 basis points whatever we said in our business update, all our operators were coming down significantly, right? I mean it's happening across the board. You see the first impact. Whoever moves out was \u2013 moves. And obviously buildings are shut down. Now we're seeing more nuanced approach and difference of performance. We're seeing some of our operators have flattened out literally flat. We are seeing a couple of our operators are starting to gain occupancy as they have started to open some of the communities particularly as of May 1. So they are more nuanced location by location uncorrelated performance that's based on demographic, psychographics and supply of a given location is starting to happen. But it is too early to say when that will completely manifest and we get back to the norm.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. \nMichael Carroll: Yeah, thanks. Shankh in your prepared remarks you kind of commented that there might be some investment opportunities as the result of this. I mean how should we expect that Welltower is going to pursue those types of deals? Do you want to wait until the market stabilizes a bit until you actually have some clarity of what's actually going on? Or you be more opportunistic to find some distressed opportunities? \nShankh Mitra: Thank you for that question, Mike. So clarity often comes with a price right? When you mean clarity, you probably mean that when we have clarity, we have a line of the goalpost of what we know what will happen to the NOI. That is generally true for majority of the businesses. It doesn't have to be true for real estate. You know what it costs to build a building in a given location. So if that's the case you can bake in what is the price per door, price per foot of a specific opportunity and then you can have enough margin of safety that you don't have to know what will be the NOI next three months. We have never bought buildings that way. We have our view of what is the margin occupancy and obviously pricing of a building should be with our operators and specific with us \u2013 one of our specific operators and we will act accordingly. But it has to be priced in so that we can take that near-term uncertainty to create long-term value.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Tom you mentioned hospitals. So the CARES Act has essentially provided the federal backstop to hospitals. And we feel deem them critical infrastructure. Does this change your view at all on the future of hospital investments within the overall health system? And secondly do we still have too many?\nTom DeRosa: I think there are still too many hospitals in the U.S. and I think you're going to continue to see consolidation. I think that it's very interesting. If you look at the hospitals Derek you've got many of them who are operating at 50% capacity because elective surgeries have fallen off the cliff and they've not had as many COVID cases. So it's a very challenging time for the health systems. And I \u2013 again it's very hard to predict the future based on where we sit right now in the middle of this pandemic. But I don't \u2013 I think ultimately we have \u2013 you're going to see broader outpatient strategies by health systems a movement away from the hospital. At least that's what we're seeing from our conversations. And obviously, our health systems are on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government has responded by supporting them through this. Because their beds are filled with people many health systems in the hotspots are filled with people with COVID and they do not have the elective surgeries. And a lot of those are being pushed off. It's a real \u2013 it's created a very challenging environment for our health systems today. But again Derek I wouldn't again make too many predictions based on the COVID-19. I think it's going to badly damage a lot of health care infrastructure. But I think to a large extent it's going to have to be rethought and reimagined. So again hard to make any predictions but I would say that we still from our conversations we think health systems are looking to deliver their services basically outside of the four walls of the traditional acute care hospital.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. \nJordan Sadler: Thanks. Just wanted to touch on sort of green shoots if I could. I know it's way, way too early. But can you maybe just point to sort of the best story in the portfolio? And what you're seeing? I think you did highlight Seattle but anywhere else that's sort of maybe driving what seems to be a little bit of optimism at least in the occupancy forecast for May and June in the SHO portfolio? Just tell us what's happening.\nShankh Mitra: Yes so, John I know you know this. I know we have said this many times I'm going to have to \u2013 I'm going to say it again. It is too early to comment what \u2013 how things are going to play out. If we knew exactly what is going to happen we would not have done what we have done by reducing the dividend, right? I hope you acknowledge that. Having said that, I can tell you, there are two types of stories. One I mentioned, we're seeing, across the board, this is not just a Welltower comment. I think you have to acknowledge how hard people on the frontline are working to keep our residents safe provide all the assistance of daily living it is very, very hard. And we are seeing all these letters that are coming from our operators were sharing with us all these letters where residents and their families are thanking our operating partners how much that means to them and how good they feel that they're taken care of in this kind of when this pandemic goes on. That tells us the product there's a true need for the product. Now, as I told you that we \u2013 the moment, one of our operators opened a handful of buildings on May 1, the moment that building opened occupancy went up on that day 50 basis points, right? I had a conversation a couple of days ago with one of our operators, one of our best operators in the New Jersey, New York market and the CEO told me that if she opens up buildings today, the occupancy can go up by 300 basis points. There is that much pent up demand. I'm not trying to tell you that it's true for every building. I'm not trying to tell you that will happen. The moment all these communities open occupancy is going to go up by 300 basis points. You asked for a positive story. I gave you a positive story of what we are hearing. It is too early to say how things will play out. If we knew exactly how it will play out we will not be doing what we just did.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. I just had a question about some of the normalizing adjustments you guys have for FFO. So you had a straight-line rent receivable write-off that -- in conjunction with an amended lease. Trying to understand what's that related to. And then the provision for loan losses that you booked, I think it was related to your non-real estate loans. Can you just talk about what's going on with the loan book? And just remind us those are corporate loans to operators? And how should we think about what is actually cash income that you're receiving from your broader loan book this year? Thank you.\nTim McHugh : Yeah. Thanks. I\u2019ll take\u2026\nTom DeRosa: Go ahead, Tim.\nTim McHugh : Yes. Okay. On the normalizing. So we -- earlier this quarter Capital Senior announced agreement that came with a couple of other landlords on top of I think when they had come to prior with the third landlord. We're one of those landlords. So, as part of that we restructured our lease with them into essentially runs through year-end, and then the properties will be transitioned. So the write-off there is due to just the straight-line from the remainder of that lease. So that was Capital Senior restructure. And then the provision for loan loss was not a write-off of the actual loan, but it's -- we've impaired the loan under just a change in our view on collectibility. And it's -- you're correct it's a corporate loan it's working capital loan. Part of the loan book that we've continued to shrink meaningfully over time is the non-real estate backed loans partially for this reason. They're obviously a bit riskier than your real estate backed loans. And on kind of cash versus GAAP we give -- in our supplement on the NAV page we break out cash interest rates versus any pick or non-cash interest we're receiving. So that should give you a pretty good idea of kind of the run rate on from both a cash and a GAAP standpoint.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors.\nLukas Hartwich: Thanks. For the SHOP development pipeline and the unstabilized, but recently completed projects. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the change in the trajectory of lease-up there.\nShankh Mitra: Lukas the lease-up definitely, obviously, will be slower than what otherwise would be if COVID didn't happen. We do think they are very strong properties in very strong locations. I can walk through property-by-property and tell you how many deposits we have, et cetera. But the matter of fact is obviously people need to get into the building for obviously that to become a revenue stream. And in this uncertain times that's obviously not happening. Post-COVID they will get back obviously to the leasing velocity, but this is -- there's no question that lease-up what we thought before COVID will be slower. So you can sort of move back everything whatever number of months that you thought it will take. You'll just have to move the number of months you will think that COVID will exist added to that and we will probably get to the similar results. Maybe there will be some pent-up demand, but I think it's safe to assume that it's pushed out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Mizuho. \nTayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning everyone.\nTom DeRosa: Hi, Tayo.\nTayo Okusanya: My question had just to do with capital allocation. Again fully understand today the goal is to kind of preserve as much liquidity as possible, but as things start to look a little bit better whenever that is can you just talk a little bit about how you would prioritize capital allocation decisions? Is it back to acquisitions? Is it the share buyback that maybe become more attractive at that point? Is it reestablish? Is it increasing the dividend? I'm just kind of curious when you kind of think about your liquidity position when the time is right how do you kind of think about deploying that?\nShankh Mitra: Yes, Tayo, that's a really, really good question one of the most important questions that we are focused on today. I laid out on my prepared remarks, how we are thinking about getting on offense. Everything we buy is a matter of obviously price and embedded IRR into it. As we sit here today there is nothing we see on the investment side that is more attractive than the stock. And that might change tomorrow that might -- we might see opportunities that are very different tomorrow, but as we sit here today. And if you -- I know you were asking about obviously liquidity, so I'll give you a more comprehensive answer on how we're thinking about buyback, because that's probably is helpful for everybody to think through. As I mentioned in my script, we believe a stock is a fractional ownership in a business. It's not a ticker. I described to you how we're thinking about allocating new capital and getting on offense. That applies to new opportunities as well as the opportunity we know the best. That is our own company. We think buyback should be number one, price sensitive. It should be only done when we think we can do that below, what the business is intrinsically worth. And which as we discussed, should be pretty simple for a real estate company like us, with a fairly good estimate of replacement cost, on price per door, and price per foot basis. Two, it should be need sensitive, should be done keeping our balance sheet sound and after intelligent growth prospects are met. And number three, it should be to the advantage of continuing shareholders. So as you know that we did not buy back stock when it was fashionable to do so. And lots of S&P 500 companies are doing it at the top of the market cycle. In fact, we sold billions of dollars of stock to grow our company. We're not contemplating buying back stock to financially engineer our earnings so that we can get paid. Just the opposite, we just described to you significant management compensation reduction today. At this current state of uncertain world, we believe that buyback is more intelligent form of capital return method, than distributing all the cash, from the business in form of dividend. But as we said, we'll not leverage up the balance sheet at this point, to take that liquidity and buy back stock. Hence, we need to source other forms of liquidity from our own assets. If we do believe that this management team is capable of executing such transaction during this pandemic, then you should think that we'll buyback stock or deploy that capital for other acquisition opportunities. If you don't and you think that the market is too uncertain and we can't get the liquidity from somewhere else then you should not think that we'll deploy cash buyback or not.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great thanks good morning, Tom and Tim and Shankh. I hope are safe. Regarding the Triple-Net portfolio updates on page 11, in the slide deck, that's definitely helpful. And just regarding the health systems in particular regardless of what's happening operationally in the memory care assets just curious, if you're able to provide a little more color on the financial health of ProMedica overall beyond 1Q 2020. And when thinking about the low twos EBITDAR coverage ratio that you showed is there any color you have from ProMedica whether these federal stimulus payments, that they're receiving in April and May are offsetting, hopefully the majority of the operational softness that they might be seeing in their acute care hospital opportunities, in the second quarter? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: So, I'll take that Steve. It is extremely inappropriate for us to get into the details of ProMedica financials. Given that it's a company with obviously have a lot of bonds outstanding. I will tell you that ProMedica is in a fine shape. Your assessment is generally right in the direction that there will be obviously, as you know, all the elective surgeries stopped. Obviously, the post-acute side of the business and the senior housing side of the business got impacted. On the other hand, they have a very large insurance business which obviously is working in a completely -- performing in a completely different direction. Regardless, your general assessment that any operating weakness should be offset by what any system whether ProMedica or not should be receiving from the CARES Act directionally is right. But it is not appropriate for us to get into more details than that. Our coverage does not include obviously any of that and primarily because it's coverage as Tim said. All our coverage reported are on a one quarter lag. And this is the actual operating performance of what happened in the buildings as of December 31st.\nSteven Valiquette: Well, maybe the simpler question then maybe is just on, the overall list of things that you might be worried about right now in the overall business where do ProMedica and memory care rank right now low or high? I'm guessing it's low but I just want to check the box on that. \nShankh Mitra: We're worried about everything. But on that line it's very, very low. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kim of BMO.\nJohn Kim: Thanks. Good morning. I guess a similar question on, any commentary you could have on financial health of your senior housing partners, whether it's SHOP or Triple-Net whether it's the ability for them to receive any government assistance. And if not, are you contemplating any financial support outside of a rent cut?\nShankh Mitra: I'll take that. John. We think, our obviously an ideal structure, our operating partners do not have. That's not a financial liability. So if you look at, this -- I'm glad you asked this question. If you look at the balance sheet of the large operators this cycle versus the last it's in a meaningfully better position. So that's sort of one general observation, on the second where there is a lease with an operator which is obviously a form of leverage I already had the discussion in response to another colleague of you asked the question how we're thinking about Triple-Net. So, I'm not going to get into that. But generally speaking other than that, right at this moment, we are not contemplating anything else.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. \nDerek Johnston: Hi, everyone. Thanks for letting me again in another one end. It seems so far that Welltower has fared favorably in COVID-19 containment versus other senior housing peers, let's say, with less resources. So how are you planning on marketing your core SHOW competencies really to capture outside or outsized or maybe even pent-up demand once admission bans end and basically go on offense?\nTom DeRosa: So Derek, it's very much at the hands of the operators. We are not -- we don't promote individual operators. That's their business. I do think as they have good data to show that will be very helpful. I think that the industry is gathering together, which is I think an important piece here to promote what good is happening throughout the senior living industry. A lot of the media attention has been focused on negativity, on some tragic situations that have occurred in largely undercapitalized nursing facilities. But I think that there will -- Shankh said this. I think there will be good stories to tell about how they manage the needs of their population during this impossible situation. And you can be sure that they will be aggressively marketing those stories to help people regain confidence in the sector.\nShankh Mitra: And I'll just add Derek. You're asking an extremely good question. We do believe that coming out of this crisis there will be stronger operators. Strong operators will get stronger. Strong operators with more access to technology or other types of health opportunities or outcomes will have -- will get stronger. So there has been a lot of marginal players got into the business because of slip in real estate was very profitable in sort of call it the 2014, 2015, 2016 time frame. And I think that you will see the operators who have been here and time-tested with operating models they will gain market share.\nOperator: And there are no further questions. I would like to hand it over to management for any closing remarks.\nTom DeRosa: Thank you for participating in our call today, and we're always happy to take any additional questions directly. So please reach out to the team, if you have other questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning. I'd first like to say that I hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I know many of us have been directly impacted by COVID-19 and all of us have been indirectly impacted in some way which is having an overwhelming effect in shaping everything we are experiencing during this extraordinary period. Seniors with multiple chronic conditions who populate our senior housing property are vulnerable to any virus or infection and particularly affected by COVID-19. Historically our operators have implemented time-tested protocols for flu and inflection control that have proven to mitigate the impact of prior influenza outbreaks. However, we now know that COVID-19 is not an influenza outbreak but has become a global pandemic. Further we have learned our society's ability to slow the spread of COVID-19 rests solely with social distancing measures, given the lack of vaccines or drug therapies. The high level of personal care delivered to senior living residents combined with the fact that COVID-19 can be spread by asymptomatic residents, family members and care staff has resulted in many challenges for our operators. As Shankh and Tim will describe, our business had a strong start to the year but starting in mid-March data began to show that the growing impact of COVID-19 would make this performance not sustainable. In an effort to maintain transparency regarding our business, we have issued regular updates, which have provided context for declines in occupancy we started to see in late March that have continued through April. Given the tremendous uncertainty we face from the business model build to own real estate that enables the health and wellness needs of vulnerable seniors to be met in residential settings, this morning's call will be more focused on steps we are taking to manage this uncertainty. As Tim will discuss, we acted quickly to bolster our liquidity position. We also took numerous steps to help support our senior housing operators, health system, post-acute care and medical office tenants through this unprecedented period. For example, in March, we started to source and distribute much needed personal protective equipment or PPE for many of our operators and tenants who could not access for example, masks, gloves, gowns and testing kits. These efforts have helped our operators and tenants to better protect their staffs and residents. This is not what a REIT typically does. But extraordinary measures are often needed in extraordinary times like these. We told you in March that we would use data to guide all decisions regarding our business. Therefore, occupancy declines within our senior housing operating portfolio, a continual increase in operator expenses due to staffing and the cost of PPE, rent deferment requests from medical office tenants and the impacts of a sharp decline in elective surgeries combined \u2013 contributed to our decision to withdraw our 2020 guidance on April 17. There is much outside of our control, but we are taking steps to manage what is within our control. After a successful program to reduce overall G&A spend over the past three years, we believe we can lower G&A expenses this year by approximately $10 million to $15 million on an annualized basis by reducing compensation and non-compensation expenses. Additionally, at this point, we believe that it would not be prudent to pay 100% of our dividend, until we have more clarity regarding our cash flow for the year. So we've decided to pay 70% of our pre-COVID dividend. This was also a data-driven decision but it was by no means an easy decision. But we believe this is in the best long-term interests of our shareholders. Virtually overnight, COVID-19 has meaningfully impacted our business and changed our near-term objectives. However, we remain committed to our long-term strategy of being an important platform and real estate partner for constituents across the health care continuum to enable them to more effectively achieve the goals of value-based health care. Critical to our strategy is to focus on ensuring that the social determinants of health are met for all populations and especially for vulnerable populations like seniors. Since we began to shelter in place, even the most resilient people have experienced challenges with basic social determinants, such as sourcing groceries, medication and isolation and loneliness. Residential care concepts like senior housing allow these much needed activities of daily living to be delivered in consistent, supportive, efficient, and cost-effective ways. This is why we believe in the long-term viability of this business. When COVID-19 is a bad memory, we will still need to meet the health and wellness needs of a rapidly aging population and to reimagine and develop a more sustainable health care delivery infrastructure. That being said, we believe we are taking the necessary steps to navigate this uncertain environment and withstand the volatility presented by this pandemic so that we can meet this mission. And with that, I will turn this over to Tim McHugh who will take us through the financials. Tim? Thanks, Shankh. Before we open the line for questions, I just would like to say that I'm very fortunate to work with such a team of talented and dedicated individuals who are coming together during the harshest of circumstances. All of you know it's not easy to be working remotely and having a team that's used to being together and work remotely. Yet, the entire Welltower team has proven their commitment to our company's goals and are playing a critical role in our long-term success and I could not be more appreciative of their efforts. I'm happy to share with you this morning that our Board recently moved to recognize two of our most trusted leaders. As a result Shankh Mitra has been named Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer in addition to his role as Chief Investment Officer; and Tim McHugh has been named an Executive Vice President in addition to serving as Chief Financial Officer. Shank and Tim are being recognized for their intellect experience, broad internal and external leadership and dedication to Welltower. I'm extremely grateful and proud to work shoulder to shoulder albeit virtually now with both of them every day as we navigate Welltower through a period of great uncertainty toward brighter days ahead. So before we open for questions, I'd just like to say that we ask that you please limit your question to one question. And if you have another question to please jump back in the queue because a number of analysts have asked that we -- they may have to jump off the call a bit early because of the number of companies reporting today. So I ask you to please adhere to that. And with that -- and we'll stay on to answer all your questions. So, with that, I'll turn -- Andrea, you can open up the line. Jonathan, I'm going to have Shankh to answer that, but it's going to be -- it's very hard for us to predict anything beyond the second quarter. But, Shankh, why don't you jump in and give your thoughts? That's a good question, Michael. Let me start off. Look we still believe that because of the aging of the population and because of the needs of a population seniors who are going to be living longer, we are still committed to models that bring those seniors together in settings that can better manage their needs whether they are less acute or more acute. So we -- while we are sitting at a moment in time that that is challenging that model, we think -- we don't think there's a better alternatives longer-term than putting seniors in environments where you hear me talk about this a lot. Their social determinant needs can be met effectively and cost efficiently. At the same time, we're opportunistic we're capital allocators and we look across all sectors of health care. I would say that prior to the last two-plus months you saw us making progress with a number of our health system initiatives, which would have started to bring in more diversification into our portfolio. Remember that the nation's health systems are thinking very differently about where they will provide their services in the future what different settings outside of the hospital. And many of them are aligned with us about settings that where they can better deliver services to seniors. So we're very much still committed to the senior business, because we think it has the biggest impact on the future of health care. Shankh, do you want to add anything to that? Yeah. That's a fair question Rich. Look it's hard for us to make predictions right now based on what we've been dealing with in the pandemic. Well, I think that there will be fundamental changes in the service model and the asset positioning? Somewhat, I mean we were headed there particularly with technology companies. And I think there's going to be more new technologies that will enter senior living buildings that will essentially create tremendous efficiencies and mitigate some of the risks that we're seeing today due to an infection or a viral outbreak in buildings. I think it's very early to say if social distancing is going to be the way of a future. I mean that's a \u2013 if that's true if we're going to live in a world where we have to stand six feet apart from each other I think every business is going to be challenged and \u2013 but I'm hopeful that's not the future. I'm hopeful that we will get through this period and come back to the types of models that have been evolving to manage what is still one of the biggest demographic issues we've seen which is the aging of the population. And I also believe a health care system a health care delivery infrastructure that will have been compromised by this pandemic. And we already know that many leaders of health systems are thinking very differently about the setting in which they meet their constituencies. So, Rich it's very early to say. I'm hopeful we don't live in a world where we have to stand six feet apart from each other long term. Shankh you have anything to add. I think there are still too many hospitals in the U.S. and I think you're going to continue to see consolidation. I think that it's very interesting. If you look at the hospitals Derek you've got many of them who are operating at 50% capacity because elective surgeries have fallen off the cliff and they've not had as many COVID cases. So it's a very challenging time for the health systems. And I \u2013 again it's very hard to predict the future based on where we sit right now in the middle of this pandemic. But I don't \u2013 I think ultimately we have \u2013 you're going to see broader outpatient strategies by health systems a movement away from the hospital. At least that's what we're seeing from our conversations. And obviously, our health systems are on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government has responded by supporting them through this. Because their beds are filled with people many health systems in the hotspots are filled with people with COVID and they do not have the elective surgeries. And a lot of those are being pushed off. It's a real \u2013 it's created a very challenging environment for our health systems today. But again Derek I wouldn't again make too many predictions based on the COVID-19. I think it's going to badly damage a lot of health care infrastructure. But I think to a large extent it's going to have to be rethought and reimagined. So again hard to make any predictions but I would say that we still from our conversations we think health systems are looking to deliver their services basically outside of the four walls of the traditional acute care hospital. Go ahead, Tim. Hi, Tayo. So Derek, it's very much at the hands of the operators. We are not -- we don't promote individual operators. That's their business. I do think as they have good data to show that will be very helpful. I think that the industry is gathering together, which is I think an important piece here to promote what good is happening throughout the senior living industry. A lot of the media attention has been focused on negativity, on some tragic situations that have occurred in largely undercapitalized nursing facilities. But I think that there will -- Shankh said this. I think there will be good stories to tell about how they manage the needs of their population during this impossible situation. And you can be sure that they will be aggressively marketing those stories to help people regain confidence in the sector. Thank you for participating in our call today, and we're always happy to take any additional questions directly. So please reach out to the team, if you have other questions. Thank you."

            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I will comment on our operating environment and follow-up with our thoughts on capital allocation. When we last spoke with you on our Q4 earnings call, we had a bullish outlook for the business with a sharp portfolio gaining strength, our MOB portfolio retooled and executing on leasing and significant relationships with health systems were formed. In January and February, we delivered results that were ahead of this bullish outlook. And then with a flip of a switch our business changed in March due to COVID-19. If you pass through our Q1 sharp results, you will notice that despite the impact of COVID-19 in March, we still delivered a 3.6% same-store RevPAR growth for the quarter. That indicates to you how strong this year could have been if COVID-19 didn't happen. But COVID-19 did happen. And there is no question that our operating earnings will be considerably lower as a result. Densely populated coastal markets have consistently helped us to maintain strong pricing power in our shop business. Unfortunately many of these markets have also become hotspot for the virus. On the positive side, we are starting to see some relative stabilization in the Seattle area where pandemic has started. But on the other hand, we're seeing New York, New Jersey getting hit hard with no sign of stabilization just yet. There are three topics that are top of our minds as far as operations are concerned. Number one, resident safety and employee safety. This is the highest priority for us and our operators. Tom, discussed how swift actions we have taken on PPE side. Two, labor. In the short-term we're experiencing elevated expense levels as Tim described though we are encouraged by the expanded labor pools interest in our business as seniors housing is one of the few industries that is hiring today. And three, leasing velocity and occupancy. We have provided you the details of occupancy decline since COVID-19 breakout along the way through our business update. We lost approximately 70 basis points of occupancy in March, 240 basis points occupancy in April in our total SHO portfolio. Occupancy will continue to drop until our operators lift admissions ban. It is challenging to predict exactly when that will take place. I have discussed with you the details of our SHO portfolio construction and how portfolio's diversity of location, acuity, price point, et cetera results in lack of a correlated growth amongst our different operators. We have tested these models again and again and sensitized for business cycles and even debt supercycles. However, what we are faced with today is a once-in-a-century pandemic, which has led to a perfect storm of an entire economy effectively sheltered in place and a virus that disproportionately affects our frail senior population. The result is a closing of the front door of many of our communities across the portfolio. And with that our diversification benefit has been compromised. But we remain committed to our long-term strategy and portfolio construction. On the asset side, we cannot manage a portfolio for once-in-a-century black swan pandemic event that's why we maintained meaningful financial flexibility on the other side of the balance sheet in terms of liquidity, leverage, debt maturity, meaningful unused capacity of secured debt particularly those available from GSEs and CMHC, should we get asset mix wrong at a given moment in time. And in this context, let's not forget seniors housing is also a form of housing and has broader access to debt capital than most other forms of real estate. As we sit here today, we see a wide range of outcome both with the pandemic and with the economy. The range of outcome has somewhat narrowed on both of these areas as infection curve has started to flatten and the Federal Reserve's forceful intervention in late March has started the flow of credit again. The range of outcome still remains meaningfully wide and we will continue to maintain significant financial flexibility until we have further clarity. As Tom and Tim discussed, distributing out majority of our cash flow in this uncertain environment with a wide range of outcomes is not a prudent capital-allocation decision at this point in time. This retention of cash flow is obviously an extremely positive -- credit positive event in the near term, but we also think it will turn out to be a very positive outcome for our continuing shareholders as it puts us another step closer towards playing offense and helps us avoid dilutive capital raises that we have observed coming out of the last cycle. In the last two months, which feels like a lifetime now all of our capital-allocation activities can be thought in two distinct mental models; short-term defense and long-term offense. Short-term defense, we acted swiftly to arrange term loan to bolster our liquidity settled our forward equity program completed many in-process dispositions and pivoted away from our acquisition outlook. All of these actions were done with a view to respond defensively in a short -- really short period of time. We are working with our operating partners to fine-tune our CapEx spending for rest of the year working through our leases with tenants across all three lines of our businesses and executing our long-term business plan with different operators in certain select assets where it's appropriate. We're also contemplating a number of development -- we're also completing a number of development projects in 2020, which you know is the last year of our significant committed development spend. We're not done with this work stream by any means, but we made significant progress in this area of short-term defense. Long-term offense. This work stream is now under progress, but is by design behind the previous set of actions. We're focused on our portfolio both in terms of refinancing and recapitalization and starting to contemplate what opportunities might emerge for us to deploy capital. Asset values have clearly come down from pre-COVID levels. We just don't know to what extent yet. As we highlighted in our earnings release last night, a large seniors housing transaction that we discussed on our last call after the purchase and sale agreement was executed eventually did not close. The post-COVID world is more uncertain and we understand that people get cold feet. That near-term uncertainty has an impact on asset pricing. That is true for all the assets that we might be a buyer as well. We have always been price-sensitive and will continue to be even more so going forward. We remain excited about the prospects of our industry with a great demographic tailwind, especially in light of near-term supply which should decline substantially. Any incremental capital we deploy will be done after maintaining a sound balance sheet, ample liquidity and a laser-focused attention on price with a margin of safety. I would like to conclude by saying COVID-19 has created a very challenging backdrop for us. While we cannot control what happens to macro environment around us such as the pandemic, we can control how we respond to it. You as our shareholders, employ us as the managers of the business to make capital and resource-allocation decisions to create long-term value per share for continuing shareholders. We described the capital-allocation decisions we have taken so far and there are more to come. I hope our actions to prudently allocate resources to further bolster our cash flow by reducing G&A, a significant portion of which will come out of management compensation is a reflection of our alignment with you. This year has been a painful year for our shareholders and we are stepping in to share that pain with you. We ourselves are shareholders in the business and think of the stock we own as the ownership and partnership interest in the business that you all collectively own. We value this business on long-term occupancy cash flow and margin subject to a floor of replacement cost of the physical real estate not just to move around that gets valued and marked by -- marked every day by whoever wins the contest of exposure popularity or earnings prediction for the next quarter. Uncertain times are unsettling, but they create opportunity to create significant value for our shareholders over the long-term. With that, I'll pass back the mic to Tom. Tom? Yes. So Jonathan, as you know that we are expecting 500 to 600 basis points of occupancy decline for the second quarter. And that should be seen with -- obviously, coupled with the comment that's right next to it, about our comments on pricing. So, obviously, those two are interrelated and should be seen as together. But, obviously, the fact is right now majority of our communities, almost half of it, is completely shut down from new admissions' perspective and others are, relatively speaking, behaving like they were shut down, at least in the month of April. We're starting to see billings or are at least starting to open up. Communities are starting to accept new residents or we're having conversations with where our operators are telling us that they're optimistic, their buildings will start to open, sometimes in May, sometimes in June. But I want to remind you, this is obviously a decision of our operators and it's taken at the ground level community by community. So we're telling you what we are hearing, but if we knew exactly what will happen, then we would not be taking the decision that we have taken with our dividend and with our guidance. So, understand there is significant uncertainty. And as we know more, we will, as Tim said, we will let you know more. But we're telling you what we are hearing from our operating partners. Vikram, I'll add a couple of -- two more points to that just to give you some more color. First is, our Triple-Net portfolio geographic obviously very different from obviously our SHO portfolio. And if you think about the biggest impact of where COVID happened is primarily coast to coast, right? So a lot of other markets obviously not similarly hit. But that will be one source of differentiation. The second source of differentiation as you know in the Triple-Net lease very simplistically speaking right your cost is relatively known to the landlord that you write a check and you collect every dollar of cash flow after that. So if you're an operator and you have collected every dollar of cash flow above that, you have intrinsically assumed that you have the risk both up and down. That is what the structure is. Now how we view some of these situations depending obviously on duration of the spending and the effect of the spending et cetera, but how we'll act will depend on what we think of you just as we did with the Triple-Net lease between Welltower and you how -- what is our thought on you as an operator? If you think that you're a good operator in your market and this is a pretty unfortunate event that happened for one time then we'll act one way. If you think that you are not a good operator and have never been a good operator or it's not -- we don't see eye to eye on how the business should go forward, then it will be hard for us to tell you the upside is yours and downside is all our shareholders. That's not how we think. And so, it is going to be a much more nuanced answer that will be based on case by case. Yeah. Michael a couple of more granular points. First is the Welltower's portfolio is primarily a need based portfolio except \u2013 I mean, when I say U.S. our portfolio. Our U.S. and U.K. portfolio is primarily a need based portfolio. We have a couple of operating partners who are primarily independent living provider in the U.S., which we also think that in right markets with the right operator can be a very good business. But generally speaking our U.K. U.S. business \u2013 our U.S. and U.K. business are need-based business. Our independent living exposure that you're talking about is primarily a Canadian business. And we think that business is a very different business. We think that business is a housing alternative business and that will continue to do well. If you ask me today that where is the biggest opportunity as we see price aside you know that first thing we think about is price and we're a buyer of everything at a price. Price aside all things being equal I think there is no other real estate asset class that I know of that has a better opportunity to create long-term value than senior housing. So price aside if you told me that I have $1 to invest where would I invest on all health care asset classes given what the returns are going to be where total return investors I fundamentally think that will be senior housing. So if anything our exposure we'd like to take it up not down. Now, again that's the price aside comment. Yes Tom. Rich, if you think about we're always data dependent and if we're always open to the possibilities if that was your question we always are. If things change we will change. But I can tell you if you read the letters that we receive our operators receive and that they share with us sometimes we receive together about what our customers are saying and what we think is the pent-up demand for this business is we do not believe that's happening. If anything I'm not sure you saw -- or you read about Governor Cuomo's presentation yesterday. Majority of the people at least in New York where this data is published with COVID coming to hospitals are coming from homes. Only 4% of the people who are coming to New York hospitals are actually coming from assisted living. That tells you that our industry is doing something right. Now if things change we will change. But we believe that our operators and all of our people in the frontline are doing an amazing work to keep our residents safe. There's obviously no guarantee. Pandemic is everywhere. That's why it's called pandemic, right? But all seeing -- when that's all done when -- and as Tom said when COVID is a distant memory it might prove out to be the other way too. But we are always open to facts and we're always open to new possibilities. Thanks, Todd So Todd in Seattle in the beginning of this -- Seattle fell off the cliff at the beginning of this when we started giving you, obviously, all these updates. Occupancy was going down 90 basis points, 100 basis points a week. Now we are seeing occupancy is going down more like 30 basis points, 40 basis points a week something like that. So it is still going down. But obviously, the second derivative improved significantly. All I was pointing out on the other hand in New York, you have seen the infection curve has flattened and it's coming down. But it's sort of -- it's still pretty peak panic here. And obviously, all the states are not open yet. And when that happens, obviously, we'll see the impact on occupancy. But I was trying to drive, sort of, two distinction. It is purely a function of not only the psyche of the consumer, but also how safe our operators feel. I'll give you an example. One of our worst-performing market today is L.A. Southern California has been years- in years- out one of our best performing markets. And why is L.A. which is not as you think it's probably -- you don't think about L.A. today as sort of the most impacted COVID-impacted market. It is meaningfully impacted, but that's not sort of, what you call the eye of the storm. The reason being all of our operators have buildings admissions banned everywhere in Southern California in L.A. particularly. So it is a function of when our operators feel safe enough to open the buildings for new residents. And when that happens you will see occupancy will come back. It is hard to say when that will happen. I will give you some more color for you to think about. Four weeks ago, when we were seeing occupancies going down so let's call it 60 basis points whatever we said in our business update, all our operators were coming down significantly, right? I mean it's happening across the board. You see the first impact. Whoever moves out was \u2013 moves. And obviously buildings are shut down. Now we're seeing more nuanced approach and difference of performance. We're seeing some of our operators have flattened out literally flat. We are seeing a couple of our operators are starting to gain occupancy as they have started to open some of the communities particularly as of May 1. So they are more nuanced location by location uncorrelated performance that's based on demographic, psychographics and supply of a given location is starting to happen. But it is too early to say when that will completely manifest and we get back to the norm. Thank you for that question, Mike. So clarity often comes with a price right? When you mean clarity, you probably mean that when we have clarity, we have a line of the goalpost of what we know what will happen to the NOI. That is generally true for majority of the businesses. It doesn't have to be true for real estate. You know what it costs to build a building in a given location. So if that's the case you can bake in what is the price per door, price per foot of a specific opportunity and then you can have enough margin of safety that you don't have to know what will be the NOI next three months. We have never bought buildings that way. We have our view of what is the margin occupancy and obviously pricing of a building should be with our operators and specific with us \u2013 one of our specific operators and we will act accordingly. But it has to be priced in so that we can take that near-term uncertainty to create long-term value. Yes so, John I know you know this. I know we have said this many times I'm going to have to \u2013 I'm going to say it again. It is too early to comment what \u2013 how things are going to play out. If we knew exactly what is going to happen we would not have done what we have done by reducing the dividend, right? I hope you acknowledge that. Having said that, I can tell you, there are two types of stories. One I mentioned, we're seeing, across the board, this is not just a Welltower comment. I think you have to acknowledge how hard people on the frontline are working to keep our residents safe provide all the assistance of daily living it is very, very hard. And we are seeing all these letters that are coming from our operators were sharing with us all these letters where residents and their families are thanking our operating partners how much that means to them and how good they feel that they're taken care of in this kind of when this pandemic goes on. That tells us the product there's a true need for the product. Now, as I told you that we \u2013 the moment, one of our operators opened a handful of buildings on May 1, the moment that building opened occupancy went up on that day 50 basis points, right? I had a conversation a couple of days ago with one of our operators, one of our best operators in the New Jersey, New York market and the CEO told me that if she opens up buildings today, the occupancy can go up by 300 basis points. There is that much pent up demand. I'm not trying to tell you that it's true for every building. I'm not trying to tell you that will happen. The moment all these communities open occupancy is going to go up by 300 basis points. You asked for a positive story. I gave you a positive story of what we are hearing. It is too early to say how things will play out. If we knew exactly how it will play out we will not be doing what we just did. Lukas the lease-up definitely, obviously, will be slower than what otherwise would be if COVID didn't happen. We do think they are very strong properties in very strong locations. I can walk through property-by-property and tell you how many deposits we have, et cetera. But the matter of fact is obviously people need to get into the building for obviously that to become a revenue stream. And in this uncertain times that's obviously not happening. Post-COVID they will get back obviously to the leasing velocity, but this is -- there's no question that lease-up what we thought before COVID will be slower. So you can sort of move back everything whatever number of months that you thought it will take. You'll just have to move the number of months you will think that COVID will exist added to that and we will probably get to the similar results. Maybe there will be some pent-up demand, but I think it's safe to assume that it's pushed out. Yes, Tayo, that's a really, really good question one of the most important questions that we are focused on today. I laid out on my prepared remarks, how we are thinking about getting on offense. Everything we buy is a matter of obviously price and embedded IRR into it. As we sit here today there is nothing we see on the investment side that is more attractive than the stock. And that might change tomorrow that might -- we might see opportunities that are very different tomorrow, but as we sit here today. And if you -- I know you were asking about obviously liquidity, so I'll give you a more comprehensive answer on how we're thinking about buyback, because that's probably is helpful for everybody to think through. As I mentioned in my script, we believe a stock is a fractional ownership in a business. It's not a ticker. I described to you how we're thinking about allocating new capital and getting on offense. That applies to new opportunities as well as the opportunity we know the best. That is our own company. We think buyback should be number one, price sensitive. It should be only done when we think we can do that below, what the business is intrinsically worth. And which as we discussed, should be pretty simple for a real estate company like us, with a fairly good estimate of replacement cost, on price per door, and price per foot basis. Two, it should be need sensitive, should be done keeping our balance sheet sound and after intelligent growth prospects are met. And number three, it should be to the advantage of continuing shareholders. So as you know that we did not buy back stock when it was fashionable to do so. And lots of S&P 500 companies are doing it at the top of the market cycle. In fact, we sold billions of dollars of stock to grow our company. We're not contemplating buying back stock to financially engineer our earnings so that we can get paid. Just the opposite, we just described to you significant management compensation reduction today. At this current state of uncertain world, we believe that buyback is more intelligent form of capital return method, than distributing all the cash, from the business in form of dividend. But as we said, we'll not leverage up the balance sheet at this point, to take that liquidity and buy back stock. Hence, we need to source other forms of liquidity from our own assets. If we do believe that this management team is capable of executing such transaction during this pandemic, then you should think that we'll buyback stock or deploy that capital for other acquisition opportunities. If you don't and you think that the market is too uncertain and we can't get the liquidity from somewhere else then you should not think that we'll deploy cash buyback or not. So, I'll take that Steve. It is extremely inappropriate for us to get into the details of ProMedica financials. Given that it's a company with obviously have a lot of bonds outstanding. I will tell you that ProMedica is in a fine shape. Your assessment is generally right in the direction that there will be obviously, as you know, all the elective surgeries stopped. Obviously, the post-acute side of the business and the senior housing side of the business got impacted. On the other hand, they have a very large insurance business which obviously is working in a completely -- performing in a completely different direction. Regardless, your general assessment that any operating weakness should be offset by what any system whether ProMedica or not should be receiving from the CARES Act directionally is right. But it is not appropriate for us to get into more details than that. Our coverage does not include obviously any of that and primarily because it's coverage as Tim said. All our coverage reported are on a one quarter lag. And this is the actual operating performance of what happened in the buildings as of December 31st. We're worried about everything. But on that line it's very, very low. I'll take that. John. We think, our obviously an ideal structure, our operating partners do not have. That's not a financial liability. So if you look at, this -- I'm glad you asked this question. If you look at the balance sheet of the large operators this cycle versus the last it's in a meaningfully better position. So that's sort of one general observation, on the second where there is a lease with an operator which is obviously a form of leverage I already had the discussion in response to another colleague of you asked the question how we're thinking about Triple-Net. So, I'm not going to get into that. But generally speaking other than that, right at this moment, we are not contemplating anything else. And I'll just add Derek. You're asking an extremely good question. We do believe that coming out of this crisis there will be stronger operators. Strong operators will get stronger. Strong operators with more access to technology or other types of health opportunities or outcomes will have -- will get stronger. So there has been a lot of marginal players got into the business because of slip in real estate was very profitable in sort of call it the 2014, 2015, 2016 time frame. And I think that you will see the operators who have been here and time-tested with operating models they will gain market share."

            "name": "Tim McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2020 results. The early impact of COVID-19 and our tenants observed within the quarter and into April. And finally, a capital activity and balance sheet update. As a reminder to everyone on the call, Welltower removed all components of full year guidance in mid-April, after reviewing our first month of financial results with the impact of COVID-19. We believe the extent of COVID-19's impact on our portfolio will depend on many factors. We cannot accurately predict the future implications this pandemic will have in our business trends at this time. Although, there is no assurance that we are currently experiencing peak impact as it pertains to both our business or the broader economy, we are hopeful that we are moving through the period of peak uncertainty. And as that uncertainty diminishes, we'll be able to provide you more clarity on our outlook. Moving to the quarter, Welltower reported normalized FFO of $1.02 per diluted share for the first quarter. These results included a total of $7 million or approximately $0.02 per diluted share of unanticipated property level costs in our senior housing operating portfolio, associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Welltower is elected to not normalize these COVID-related expenses from both FFO and same-store results. Now turning to our individual portfolio of components. First, our Seniors Housing Triple-Net portfolio delivered 3% year-over-year same-store growth and both occupancy and EBITDAR coverages were flat on a sequential basis. As a reminder, our Triple-Net lease portfolio operating stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2019 and therefore do not reflect any impact in COVID-19. We expect our Seniors Housing Triple-Net operators to experience similar headwinds as everyday operators during the second quarter. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated 2.6% year-over-year same-store growth. And EBITDAR coverage declined by three basis points sequentially. On to health systems which is comprised of our joint venture with ProMedica. As indicated on last quarter's call, EBITDAR growth was strong in the fourth quarter in this portfolio and subsequently rent coverage improved eight basis points sequentially to 2.14 times. Rent collection across our Triple-Net segments including seniors housing, long-term post-acute and health systems was consistent with the historical in the first quarter. In April, we have collected 97% of total rents due. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical portfolio had another consistent quarter delivering 2.1% same-store growth. Our rent collection was in line with historical norms in the first quarter and in April we collected or approved rent deferral on 95% of our rent due. Early on in the pandemic, we are in active discussions with our tenants that were most impacted by the considerable slowdown in the facilities-based revenue streams, most significantly elected procedures. We focused on providing 60-day deferrals spanning April and May and as a result of these discussions, we've approved approximately 8% of our monthly rents for two-month deferral plans with payback periods within calendar year 2020. As of today, we believe approximately 25% of these deferrals, we brought current in the near term as tenants received financial support and see operations begin to open back up. Lastly, our Seniors Housing operating portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI declined 1.6% in the quarter. A stronger-than-expected first two months of the year were more than offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on both March occupancy and expenses with approximately 5.2 million of unanticipated expenses occurring in the property level within our same-store pool. As a reminder, we did not normalize COVID-related expenses out of our same-store metrics. Turning to April and as highlighted in our business update presentation released alongside our earnings last night, we experienced an acceleration in the occupancy pressures that began in March, as total portfolio occupancy fell 240 basis points in the month of April versus a 70 basis point decline in March, driven primarily by a significant decrease in move-ins as outright admission bans became more common across our portfolio at the start of April. We expect these occupancy declines to continue throughout the second quarter with occupancy expected to decrease 500 to 600 basis points by June 30th. We intend to continue our periodic updates throughout the second quarter to help investors and analysts better understand these trends. Before turning to the balance sheet, I wanted to make one final point on same-store. As I alluded to last quarter and as shown in this morning's 10-Q, we have aligned our Q and K disclosures of same-store with our supplemental disclosures, but the only difference is being the normalizations that we detail on page 22 of our supplement consistent with historical disclosure practices. Now on to the balance sheet and capital activity. I want to move through these highlights in two distinct sections. First our balance sheet, focusing on both liquidity and leverage; and then capital spend as it pertains to investments, developments, CapEx, corporate overhead and lastly our dividend. Starting with capital market activity. In early March we obtained commitments for a two-year unsecured term loan of $1 billion bearing interest at LIBOR plus 120 with the right to further upsize the borrowed amount by $200 million. We've closed on this loan on April 1st and the loan will be drawn in the second quarter. During the quarter we issued approximately two million shares via our DRIP and ATM forward programs at a weighted average price of $83.94 per share for estimated proceeds of $171 million. At the end of the quarter, we settled these in all prior forward sale agreements totaling 6.8 million shares and average price of $86.48 per share for $588 million of gross proceeds. The settlement of these forwards this brings Welltower's equity raise via DRIP and ATM since the start of 2019 to $1.7 billion at an average price of $80.64. Following these activities and as of May 4, we have approximately $2.36 billion of capacity under our $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, $1 billion of capacity under our undrawn term loan and cash and cash equivalents of $348 million, totaling just over $3.7 billion of liquidity with no unsecured debt maturities until 2023. Turning to leverage. We ended the quarter at 5.93 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 44 basis point sequential decrease from year-end. Although, we expect EBITDA to experience more bearing in the coming quarters due to the impact of COVID-19, we believe our leverage position entering this challenging period as well as our liquidity position will allow us to endure this period of uncertainty. Moving to capital spend and starting with investments. In the first quarter, we completed $398 million of acquisitions across four separate transactions at a blended yield of 5.6%. We have no further material acquisitions under contract for the remainder of 2020. On the disposition front, we completed $781 million of pro rata dispositions including $64 million related to a disposition of an unconsolidated equity investment during the quarter. We anticipate another $386 million of property sales during the remainder of the year including $121 million of sales and the final two tranches of our Invesco JV, the first of which closed in April for $74 million. Moving to development, we completed the $141 million of development spend in the quarter. We expect development spend of $463 million for the remainder of the year and then only $178 million of spend beyond 2020 to complete our current pipeline. The large majority of our development pipeline in the final stages of construction, we continue to view these developments as excellent uses of capital and as a medium-term source of natural deleveraging as they begin to produce cash flow over the next 24 months. Turning to capital spend on our existing portfolio. We anticipate reducing our CapEx by approximately $90 million from our initial budget for 2020. This will be accomplished from a combination of tighter restrictions and project work during the pandemic, deferred leasing capital on outpatient medical as leasing activity slows during the same period and also some delaying of larger capital projects across all asset types until we have more certainty around our outlook. Now on to corporate overhead. I first want to start by acknowledging the incredible work done across our organization over the past two months. We've spent considerable time over the last four years, focusing on lowering the run rate costs of managing our business on behalf of shareholders. Our core initiative in this pursuit has been the operational efficiencies gained through streamlining reporting systems. And although we certainly did not have this current pandemic in mind when we were designing these processes, it has certainly paid off as our accounting, FP&A, tax and treasury teams amongst many others have done a tremendous job keeping our organization functioning at a very high level while working from home. On the corporate overhead front, we've lowered our expectations for full year G&A to between $125 million to $130 million versus our prior guidance of $140 million. This reduction is being driven by expected reductions in management and incentive compensation, reduction in travel expenses and new hires and a minimization of all discretionary corporate spend. Lastly as announced in last night's earnings release, we have decided to reduce our quarterly dividend to 70% of our pre-COVID quarterly dividend levels, resulting in a $0.61 per share dividend declared last night. Given the uncertainty surrounding the short and long-term impact of COVID-19 in our business and the broader economy as a whole, we felt preserving liquidity by reducing our second quarter dividend to better match our near-term expectations of underlying cash flow was the most prudent way for us to maximize balance sheet stability as we navigate these unprecedented times. We expect to further evaluate our long-term dividend policy as the year progresses. And with that, I will hand the call over to Shankh. Yes, Steve. This is Tim here and I'll take that. So you're correct in thinking through this from the dividend, largely following taxable book income, as part of kind of REIT rules. Our view is that -- I mean, not our view, our expectation is that taxable book income will largely follow profitability. So there shouldn't be a large gap between what you see on the operating performance side and what ends up being kind of taxable income for the year. So you should think without getting too much into kind of how those two things might be slightly different within any given period, you should view the dividend cut is just being more a review on our -- on the management team view of where short-term cash flow's gone. Yes, Vikram. Tim here, again. I noted in my prepared remarks and what we -- how we're kind of thinking about that is Triple-Net or RIDEA is the same business in a different financial structure, right? And we've spent a lot of time talking about there being differences in our ability to control CapEx, various reasons why -- how our businesses evolve as we've become an owner of RIDEA properties in larger part versus Triple-Net properties. But the underlying businesses are largely the same. And the day-to-day business that goes in those facilities is the same. So we expect the performance of assets within the Triple-Net to be very similar to the RIDEA. Obviously, different according to different types of facilities, different geographies, et cetera. But our expectation is that, the Triple-Net fundamentals very much follow the fundamentals from RIDEA side. And as we kind of think about that in terms of how that impacts financials, I think the most conservative way to think about it is that long-term rents in any Triple-Net are going to follow the economics of the buildings. There's a lot more complexity to forecasting that than there's RIDEA where if we think about fundamentals and how they flow we'll see that go one-for-one into our financials. And I'll just say that we've been -- we mentioned rent collections in Seniors Housing Triple-Net to this point have been strong. And it continued to be even into May. And I think that we have not entered any deferral programs. We'll continue to update the market as we kind of think through that. But there will be I think some difference between kind of how those rent checks come in and underlying EBITDAR for some period of time. And it probably matters on the duration of weakness and the extent of it to how -- if any restructures occur how and when they occur. Yeah. Thanks. I'll take... Yes. Okay. On the normalizing. So we -- earlier this quarter Capital Senior announced agreement that came with a couple of other landlords on top of I think when they had come to prior with the third landlord. We're one of those landlords. So, as part of that we restructured our lease with them into essentially runs through year-end, and then the properties will be transitioned. So the write-off there is due to just the straight-line from the remainder of that lease. So that was Capital Senior restructure. And then the provision for loan loss was not a write-off of the actual loan, but it's -- we've impaired the loan under just a change in our view on collectibility. And it's -- you're correct it's a corporate loan it's working capital loan. Part of the loan book that we've continued to shrink meaningfully over time is the non-real estate backed loans partially for this reason. They're obviously a bit riskier than your real estate backed loans. And on kind of cash versus GAAP we give -- in our supplement on the NAV page we break out cash interest rates versus any pick or non-cash interest we're receiving. So that should give you a pretty good idea of kind of the run rate on from both a cash and a GAAP standpoint."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q4 2021 Welltower Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead.\nMatt McQueen: Thank you and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that I'll hand the call over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt and good morning everyone. I'll review the quarter, reflect back on 2021 on this year-end call, walk you through high-level business trends, and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the operational environment for show and MOB portfolios and Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights, and first quarter guidance. 2021 was a year marked by high conviction capital deployment, partner and talent acquisition, and a powerful inflection in our senior housing business. Our belief in the long-term demand thesis for the senior housing proved out as we witnessed significant occupancy growth starting in the spring of last year which continued through the historically seasonally weak winter season. Just as importantly, in the second half of 2021, we began to see a significant shift in the pricing power. Interestingly, we found these pricing power during a period of relatively low occupancy levels. After all what industry or asset class do you know of that is able to achieve pricing power with occupancy levels in the low 70% range. Low behold that pricing power continued to strengthen in Q4 and in the first quarter of this year despite the impact of Delta and Omicron. Same-store RevPAR grew 3.4% in Q4 falling year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 4.8% one of the strongest quarter in the company's history. And even more encouraging is the revenue growth in US exceeded 6% with the momentum accelerating through fourth quarter. John will walk you through the details in a moment. Though I am not happy with our soft par bottom-line results due to increased expenses mainly from the Omicron induced labor crisis, I continue to believe we will see significant improvement throughout the year given the continued net hiring trends we're seeing from our operating partners. This assumes we don't experience a highly infectious variant. We can offset the higher cost of full-time employees just as we have done during the years prior to COVID, it is a significant presence of contract labor at search pricing level that is a source of the issue. From a demand standpoint, we saw record interest in our product in Q4 that continued through January with inquiries up significantly from December. However, a meaningful number of tours got canceled or postponed as either the prospective resident or their family got COVID or a community that did not have enough employees to conduct the tour as there was a COVID crisis in the communities. However, the tours have picked up meaningfully in recent weeks and we are starting to see strong sales activity, which should translate into higher net move-ins in next three to four weeks. If we are right about this, you may see occupancy growth exceed seasonal trends, while occurring in an environment of strong rate growth. We project this will put us into the double-digit NOI growth range in Q1 only to accelerate further throughout the year. As disappointed as I am about the diminished bottom line flow-through in Q4, due to $30 million of agency costs compared to only $5 million in Q1 of last year, I continue to believe that our 2022 exit run rate and 2023 earnings power of this platform is unchanged. Moving to capital allocation. In 2021, we deployed $5.7 billion across great real estate, with fantastic operator and at even a better price. The most incredible aspect of this story was the granular nature of execution with a median transaction size of $26 million. We're not believers in elephant hunting, as larger transactions usually result in value accruing to the seller. As you know, we manage this company for our long-term shareholders to increase our share value. Q4 was no exception to this consistent trend. We have deployed $1.4 billion of capital in Q4 across 20 separate transactions with a median size of $24 million. I won't bore you with the details of every transaction, but I would be remiss not to mention a couple of them, which I'm particularly proud of, including a handful of trophy buildings in Boston and Florida at a very attractive basis. But perhaps the most exciting investment of the quarter was the formation of our partnership with Andy and Glynn at Quality Senior Living, or QSL. It is hard to overstate how strong of a team, Andy and Glynn have built from conceptualization of the product, to development execution and ultimately their operational excellence. For example, despite all the labor challenges that I've highlighted, QSL have used virtually no agency labor and their buildings are well occupied. Andy who is one of the biggest users of our data analytics platform is embarking on a multi-year effort to expand the Blake brand with the full support of our platform behind him. I hope you are seeing a pattern here with how our data and predictive analytics platform attracts some of the best people in the business, as we offer so much more than capital. This network effect of platform execution across multi-year partnership that were formed over the last few years will fuel our growth for years to come. As Delta and Omicron induce challenges, we had that ugly head in Q4, capital deployment opportunity set only expanded and that continued in Q1, which is seasonally the weakest quarter from a deal activity. With -- after a strong close of 2021, we have already closed an approximately $600 million of the investment over the last six weeks. And I'm pleased to report that our pipeline remains robust, highly visible and actionable. While the capital market backdrops remain volatile of late driven primarily by the Fed headlines, we're well positioned to fund our pipeline with well over $1 billion of equity and availability of liquidity in excess of $4 billion. We're proud of our capital allocation track record both deployment and sourcing. But if capital markets volatility continues, we will access different tools from our toolbox, as we have done before. Lastly, I'm very proud to announce our new partnership with Reuben Brothers, which is buying Avery Healthcare, one of our largest operating partner. Rubin Brothers founded by David and Simon Rubin is one of the largest family offices in the world and is the owner of prime real estate and infrastructure both in UK and globally. There are also a pioneer of investing in alternative real estate and infrastructure as an early investor and owner of Global Switch. Rubin Brothers share our optimism for the exceptional growth trajectory for health care and wellness infrastructure as society ages. We're particularly excited about the prospect of expanding the platform together as Rubin Brothers owns some of the most prime land and real estate in the UK. Tim and I have said on this call many times that temporary degradation of cash flow doesn't necessarily mean the extraction of value, Avery, which constitutes 16% of our same-store triple net NOI will be significantly delevered through this equity infusion from Rubin Brothers. Partnering with highly sophisticated global investors like Rubin Brothers validates our view of the long-term value of this business despite Wall Street's obsession with point-to-time coverage. In conclusion, I'm very proud to -- of our execution in 2021 across operations, capital allocation and partnership. The stage is set for multiyear earnings growth as we find ourselves at the bottom of both secular and cyclical cycles with unparalleled platform built with advanced data analytics 20 or so growth vehicles with different partners and talent to execute on it. The pandemic has been devastating for our entire ecosystem, but we have doubled down during this massive disruption given our high conviction investment thesis. You as our shareholders can rest assured that we'll not be resting on our laurels and that will continue to dig deeper and wider moat. With that, I'll pass it over to John. John?\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on the performance of our management operating segments in the quarter. Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our outpatient medical segment delivered 2.4% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, despite a 20 basis point decline in occupancy. We continue to see strong retention rates at 86% in the fourth quarter and with increasing construction costs and rising market rates, we will continue to push renewal rates in exchange and accept the reasonable level of increased turnover and related frictional vacancy as we maximize the value of the portfolio. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. The strong demand-based recovery in the senior housing business continues to strengthen. The show portfolio same-store revenue increased 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing the first full period of year-over-year same-store revenue growth since the beginning of the pandemic. Occupancy grew 90 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Again, the first year-over-year increase in occupancy since the beginning of the pandemic and the largest year-over-year gain for any quarter since 2016. Sequentially, the show portfolio spot occupancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the fourth quarter to 77.7%. Compounding these strong occupancy trends is a notable shift in pricing power. Over the second half of the year, operators have successfully raised and are again able to charge community raised rates and are again able to charge community fees, both of which were reflected in a 3.4% year-over-year increase in RevPAR during the quarter. And following, an outsized increases on January and February renewals with little to no pushback we expect further acceleration in RevPAR growth over the course of the year. Geographically, each of our markets Canada, the UK, and the US are showing improvement in same-store top line metrics through the quarter. Our Canadian portfolio, which has lagged the recovery, posted a year-over-year revenue decline of 3% in Q4 2021. However, the revenue decline improved intra-quarter moving from a decline of 4.2% in October 2021, to a decline of 1.4% in December 2021, compared to the prior year's respective months. Sequentially, the Canadian same-store portfolio grew at a revenue rate of 1.8% in the fourth quarter. In the UK, our same-store revenue increased 7.8% during the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, accelerating from 7.1% growth in October of 2021 to 9% in December of 2021, compared to the prior year's respective months. Finally, in the US, where the majority of our portfolio is located, year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 6.3%. The acceleration in revenue growth was particularly pronounced in the US, accelerating from 3.8% in October 2021, versus the prior year's month to 9.1% in December. Despite these encouraging top line trends, expenses increased 8.8% year-over-year driven largely by excessive agency cost. The combination of holiday time off and Omicron disruption led to an increase in agency costs in the quarter, almost 4.5 times agency expense versus the prior year's quarter. Excluding agency costs, expenses increased 5.3%. Stress and Systems highlights opportunities and issues and the extreme stress in the health care system brought on by COVID has identified some opportunities to improve the value proposition for our hard-working health care workers. The agencies have been a temporary crush, which will provide a short-term option for both operators and the health care workers. That said, the excessive use of agencies is truly short term in nature, and the exceptional premiums that they charge as much as six times, the base rate during the recent holiday period do not pass through to the agency employees, who typically do not receive benefits either. The quality of life and their work experience is substantially less desirable than that of a permanent employee. Agency employees lack the connection to their coworkers, and customers that they desire as they travel from site to site, city to city, and state to state on a daily basis, often away from their families. Additionally, agency employees are less efficient, as they do not know the systems nor the processes of the operator or the site, nor the specific customer requirement. Our operators have many workflows underway at this time to improve the value proposition for permanent employees, which were bearing fruit prior to the Omicron. Nonetheless, the results of these outsized expenses was a decline in same-store NOI of 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, but still marked an improvement from Q3 2021, with over 50% of operators delivering positive NOI growth for the period. The recovery continues to strengthen despite recent Omicron disruption and we remain confident in our ability to drive significant NOI growth in 2022. Through January, agency labor expense has declined as staff cases have fallen. Agency labor expense is expected to moderate further through the first half of 2022 and declined substantially in the second half of 2022. The other disruption caused by Omicron was a record cancellation of tourists, which Sean described. However, at this point, weekly staff cases are down 81% from their peak including an 89% drop in the US and we are seeing operations normalize. The disruption of tours and sales caused occupancy to fall about 20 basis points in January. However with the high level of traffic, we expect that the continued occupancy gains will return and that we will regain lost occupancy by the end of the quarter. Here are some quotes from our operators about the strength of traffic and deposits. \u201cDigital inquiries were up 36% over 2019 in the fourth quarter and continued strong in January\u201d. And \u201cour four-week averages for inquiries tours and deposits are the highest they've been since August of 2021, we are seeing week-over-week growth in deposits of 10%, the last four weeks running\u201d. We are experiencing the strongest January for inquiries in several years. And finally \u201cour inquiries from the last week alone have been the highest numbers we've ever experienced\u201d. In closing, I have shifted from full immersion in the business to planning in action. I'm even more excited about the future opportunities across the Welltower platform. We are leveraging our proprietary data analytics platform and operationalizing the data to drive results. This process is occurring right now as we have several workflows underway, which we expect to bear fruit in the immediate future as well as many more workflows that we expect to drive our outperformance in the quarters and years to come. I continue to be appreciative of the warm welcome and excitement expressed by our operators as we leverage our combined real estate operating company and care experience to improve the customer and employee experience and drive financial results. Each operator has a unique expertise and opportunities. We have been working very well together and offering support where needed from implementing best practices to applying data analytics to improve their business. In one case, we identified a software tool over 25 years old. As they say, the '90s called and they want their deeper back. I'm confident there is a substantial opportunity to implement operational excellence across the board and bringing the basic back office and sales operations up to match the high quality of care the operators are delivering, which will drive significant margin growth in the years to come. I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\nTim McHugh: Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2021 results. Performance of our triple-net investment segment in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet and liquidity update and finally our outlook for the first quarter. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of a $0.13 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per diluted share, relative to the guidance of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. Our results included approximately $18 million or $0.04 per diluted share of HHS funds and other out-of-period government grants that were not previously budgeted. Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months at 9/30/2021. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 4.2% year-over-year, driven by improvements in rent collections, on leases currently on cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI. We expect the impact of both these trends to accelerate in 2022. As rent collections improve given that 20% of our leases are subject to API-based escalators. Trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.8x. Looking forward we expect coverages to inflect positively in the first half of 2022 as year-over-year improvement in fundamentals followed the positive trends expected in our senior housing operating portfolio. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 0.8% year-over-year same-store NOI growth. However similar to our senior housing triple net portfolio we expect NOI growth to improve in 2022 through greater rent collections on leases currently in cash recognition as well as CPI-based rent escalators. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.29x. Over the course of 2021 we completed $458 million of long-term post-acute dispositions at a blended cap rate of 8.7%. With an additional $108 million under contract for sale at year-end. As a result, our long-term post-acute portfolio represented just 5.2% of total in-place NOI at year-end versus 10.1% at the end of 2020. A 490 basis point decline driven largely by the exit of our Genesis relationship. And lastly health systems which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System. Had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.39x. The sequential improvement in coverage was driven by the previously announced agreement to sell 25 assets that have been contributing negative EBITDA. As of year-end we completed the sale of 2021 of those assets with the remaining four held for sale. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to capitalize our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, we've sold 11.3 million shares via forward sale agreements at an initial weighted average price $85.06 per share for expected gross proceeds of $961 million. We currently have approximately 11.1 million shares remaining unsettled which are expected to generate future proceeds of $949 million. This is in addition to $220 million of expected property disposition and loan payoff proceeds. During the quarter we also issued $500 million of 10-year unsecured debt maturing in 2032 with a coupon of 2.75%. Following similar discipline in their equity funding strategy this is our third unsecured issuance in 2021, bringing full year issuance to $1.75 billion with an average ratio of 9.5 years and a coupon of 2.6%. At year-end when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. When combined with the previously mentioned $1.2 billion of combined unsettled ATM proceeds and expected disposition proceeds we are in a very strong liquidity position heading into 2022. We ended the fourth quarter with 6.95x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA down slightly from last quarter. Leverage is impacted by the timing of $1.5 billion of net investment activity completed later in the quarter. If we run rate the impact of net investment activity completed in the quarter pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA decreased to 6.75x. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of our top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio with portfolio spot occupancy ending the quarter at 77.7%, 70 basis points higher than the end of the prior quarter, but still 950 basis points below pre-COVID levels. The portfolio also sits 1300 basis points below peak occupancy levels. Setting the stage for a powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside and strong rate growth is coupled with significant margin expansion of a very depressed base. Lastly, moving to our first quarter outlook. Last night we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.17 to $0.22 per share and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.79 to $0.84, or $0.815 at the midpoint. This guidance takes into consideration approximately $6 million or $0.015 per share of HHS funds expected to be received in the first quarter. Excluding the HHS funds, the $0.80 per share midpoint of our first quarter guidance represents a $0.015 sequential increase from an as adjusted $0.785 per share number for 4Q, which excludes $18 million of previously recognized HHS and out-of-period U.K. and Canadian subsidies recognized in the quarter. This $0.015 increase is composed of $0.025 from a sequential increase in senior housing operating portfolio NOI and fourth quarter investment activity and an offset of $0.01 increase of sequential G&A and income taxes. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated first quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth of 7%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 1% to 2% growth; long-term post-acute, 1% to 2%; health systems, 2.75%; senior housing triple-net, 5% to 6%; and finally senior housing operating growth of approximately 15%, driven by revenue growth of 10%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 420 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. \nShankh Mitra: Thanks, Tim. I wanted to conclude this call by addressing something that you -- we usually don't talk about and that is our comprehensive team. We have completed -- completely overhauled and upgraded our team and this was a multi-year effort building out new areas such as predictive analytics to create a truly scalable platform. With extremely low volunteer turnover, we continue to hire the best and the brightest to further deepen our capital allocation expertise. Historically, the majority of the alpha we created have been through astute raising or deployment of capital. Over the last 15 months, though, we have also built out an industry-leading and, frankly, a very significant development team under the leadership of Mike Ferry and Ayesha Menon. The last piece of this puzzle is building out our operational excellence and asset management capabilities. This started with the hiring of John in 2021. John is building out a world-class team that will accelerate value creation for our shareholders for years to come. We have added a net 51 people last year and we're likely to add another 80 new colleagues in 2022. Many of you who follow our company closely understand that our asset platform is like a coil spring today. We spent heavily during the pandemic, but most of these assets are sitting with low occupancy and thus cash flow, which is about to be released and surge forward to realize its full value. Similarly the people side of our business platform is also a coil spring today. You are only seeing them in G&A line, but their full contribution to the revenue line will be seen in 2023 and beyond. With that, operator, please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Hughes: Hey good morning. I wanted to ask about the quality of the operator relationships in the pipeline or maybe generally out there in the seniors housing industry. I'm just wondering what the landscape looks like after a couple of years of pandemic-related headwinds. I know you have a few in progress and you've had success with several over the past few years. But how many high-quality operators remain as an opportunity that you don't already have a relationship with? And what's the size of those individual opportunities? Are they smaller or larger in terms of investment volume than the relationships established over the past few years? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Fantastic question Jonathan. As I said right now I can think of two operators that in US particularly -- this is a US-specific comment and they'll probably be the same for UK and Canada, that I can think of two specific operators that we don't have relationship today that I want to have a relationship. One of them we already have had shaken our hands this quarter and likely probably we're going to talk about it next quarter's call. So, what you are likely to see that means is we generally have the operator base the platform that we wanted to build. You would recall that before pandemic we talked about with you that we have a map, right? And in that map we have different ideas of where the different types of acuities of assets should be and what kind of operator should be running those, right? We kind of generally feel out that map. Now, what you're going to see we're going to go deep. Instead of going broad which you have seen over the last, call it 18 to 24 months, you're going to see us go very deep. And that sort of talks about -- we have a slide on our presentation you can see that we talked about give or take this 25 to 30 relationships across all asset classes not just senior housing, senior housing, medical office, and wireless housing. All three platforms that we are growing pretty significantly that we think creates a very significant opportunity of external and growth that we estimate could be an upwards of $2.5 billion, $3 billion a year for a decade to come. But that's sort of how we're thinking about it. It's going deep instead of going broad but we'll talk about hopefully another exceptional operator relationship next quarter.\nJonathan Hughes: Thank you.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. John you talked about the challenges with the staffing agency model. As you think about coming out of COVID, do you expect the business model or expense load to change to rely less on agency staffing, or is this more of a perfect storm where it's hard to actually change going forward to limit the use in times of crisis?\nJohn Burkart: Yes. No. Thank you, Nick. No, my expectation is that the business will at least get back to historical standards where agency was a small part of the whole picture just was an assistance piece. But frankly, with the workflows going on I think it's a very strong chance that agency diminishes even further because what has changed is the world has gone from a situation where there's an abundance of employees to a scarcity of employees. And so the employers now the good one to have recognized that fundamentally changed how they look at things. Recruiting has become a sales machine with KPIs for the recruiters, et cetera. The value proposition has changed dramatically. People are looking at what the employee experience is words that would never set employee experience you don't hear that. They're looking at that and they're trying to figure out how to optimize. So some changes that are going on are people are realizing like, hey, we should change your hours slightly for some employees, because they have to drop their children off at school. They can't work here, because of when we start not a big deal for us, move it an hour and it works perfectly for them. A lot of things like that are changing. So I think from my perspective, it's great for the hardworking health care employees. It will be great for the operators. And will further diminish the agencies. But it will take time for this to tail off, as I mentioned in my comments, so it won't happen overnight. But I think long run, run rate will be great.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks so much for taking the questions. So just a question on rent growth or RevPAR and margins, and just two parts to it. Just one in the strong pricing part, you're seeing can you talk about the mix between the in-place bumps and just the releasing, or the spreads you're seeing today and what your expectations are? And then on margins in your bridge it's \u2013 maybe this is not the right way to look at it, but in your bridge, it seems like you're embedding maybe a 60% to 70% incremental margin, it seems like it's reasonable. But how are you thinking about the incremental in the context of pricing power?\nJohn Burkart: Yeah. So I'm going to \u2013 on the \u2013 you managed to get two questions there and that was good. On the \u2013 on the re-leasing versus the market, clearly, net effective markets are up significantly. They were concessions and community fees that \u2013 well concessions that were given community fees that were waived that's all reversed itself. And so certainly, at one point if you go back in the industry, market rents were below in place that's now changing. And from an in-place perspective and overall the rents are moving up pretty significantly. Very consistent with the comments that Sean made previously, with the expectations of mid-5%s to 10% in that zone. What we're seeing is a lot of strength in the marketplace and a recognition that cost gap come up and it takes a certain amount of money to provide great care and that's what people want.\nShankh Mitra: Vikram, to answer your second question, we are getting you back to the pre-COVID margin on that slide. I think you're referring to slide 17. There is no question that, if you have pricing power that will improve. But remember, you also have higher labor cost. So to the extent that, you have higher pricing power in excess of higher labor costs, you will see upside to that margin. But it is getting you back to margin Q4 of 2019 margin for the portfolio that was there in Q4 of 2019.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everyone. Good morning. So in 2021, you had $5.7 billion in gross investments. So off to a solid start here in 2022, so do you believe 2021 number is the high watermark? Is that level of acquisitions repeatable or even beatable this year? And has anything changed in your terms of your ability to source opportunities or even competition for deals since our last call?\nShankh Mitra: Has anything changed? The answer is, yes. So if you think about, what we have been saying that, we are mostly focused on what we have been buying \u2013 as you can see the average age of those assets would indicate, they are the children of supply over cycle of 15 to 19, right? What you had is disruption from the revenue side because of all these variants. Then you had a disruption from the cost side because of our employee situation that we talk about. Something changed there, yes something has in the last call it 45 days. And that is what you didn't have is the pressure from financing cost. All construction loans are made on LIBOR, right? Pretty much all construction loans, a variable LIBOR-based loan. And obviously, if you look at the \u2013 how the outlook for Fed has changed over the last call it 45 to 60 days, you can imagine that third pressure is just about to come which is higher financing cost. So something has changed. And now going back is this a level of acquisition possible or beatable. The answer to that question is very simple. We're not a volume-driven investor. We're a value-driven investor. If the volume is there to create part share value we will do it. If not, we will not do it. That's just a simple how to allocate capital. The success of a team is not measured at least our team in our opinion is not the growth of the enterprise but part share value creation for existing shareholders. So as long as that opportunity is there we'll absolutely do it.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. I guess I just wanted to circle back a little bit on the guidance just to make sure Tim I understood. In the 10%, I think revenue growth that you talked about for show. Again, what was occupancy and what was rent? And then what is included in the expense side from the elevated levels that you saw in Q4? Are you sort of assuming the same level in Q1 as Q4, or did you assume some moderation?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. Thanks, Steve. So on the revenue side we're assuming 420 basis points of occupancy increase on a year-over-year basis driving that 10% revenue growth. So the remainder of that revenue growth is being driven by rate. And on the expense side, I think the best way to look at it is sequentially, we're talking a lot about agency labor. We are assuming a sequential reduction in agency labor about 10% from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in that pool. And that's supported by early trends we've seen in the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRich Hill: Hi, good morning, guys. I recognize you're not giving a full year guide but I think back to 3Q 2021, there were some bread crumbs given on where renewals and maybe street rates are trending. Based upon my notes one of your competitors have talked about 8% renewals. And I think you had talked about 1.5 times to two times faster as the renewals for street rate. Wondering if you could just provide any updates on that as we think through what full year 2022 might look like?\nShankh Mitra: Hey, Rich. John just talked about that. The street rate comments I made is a net effective rent. And you are seeing because obviously, the concessions that were given, the lack of community fees that you had, the effective net street rate is moving up because of that. Not necessarily, the pace is moving but the net effective rent is moving, we continue to see. In fact we have seen some \u2013 a couple of our operators have now moved street rate at Well [ph] In-Place rent, a couple of our very large operators have gotten much closer. So it's a pretty encouraging sort of it as we look in the future. Tim just walked you through at our 10% guidance, means, from a rate and occupancy perspective. And that sort of gives you the second answer to that question, right? So we are a shop. We're focused on ultimately optimization of revenue, not necessarily one component of the revenue. And on top of that you have to think about, one component of the revenue comes with higher cost, which is labor, right, if you just occupancy, which obviously rate doesn't. So we're trying to optimize all of those things together and that sort of blends to what we talked about which is a 10-ish percent revenue growth in Q1, 15% NOI growth in Q1, and that NOI growth should continue to accelerate as we get to the year for two reasons, right? One is, as you build occupancy, you will get obviously your marginal margin will expand obviously, right? So that's one point. Second, you will get a continuation of sort of burn-off of the agency labor that you got. So that's sort of two of these things together, you will get an acceleration of NOI growth as we get to the second half of the year. \nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Recognizing again you're not giving full year guidance to one of the larger operators in the space talked about 500 to 600 basis points of occupancy growth for the year as their target. So curious how you feel excluding any new COVID wave, how that feels to you particularly given seasonality is still apparent in the business. And typically you don't necessarily gain occupancy outside of the third quarter. So, just curious about your general commentary and targets for occupancy growth for the year.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So, first, you said the magic word, excluding any more new variants, right? So that's a very important what you mentioned there. And despite that I'm not going to venture a guess of what it will look like. I will tell you there are a couple of things to think about. Last year you got a massive disruption in Q1. You've got a significant occupancy loss, you started at a big hole and you had to climb up that hole to get to a point where on an average basis you can build out documents. So you don't have that problem this year, right? John talked about January, our occupancy from point to point is down 20 basis points, which is probably will make this January the best January we ever had seasonality perspective. So, you don't have a hole to climb out. Second, you have better demographics this year. You can see the demographics is building. So we have more demand there and that's sort of playing out for all the leads and other data that John disclosed on his script card, you have a significantly lower number of deliveries this year, right? So -- and then if you -- under your assumption if we don't get hit by four waves like we did last year, and hopefully, that will translate into better occupancy growth. I'm not going to comment on any specific operator or try to sort of venture a guess of what entire year is going to look like. However, the table is set. If all of these things we just discussed lay out, we'll see a better year. But we're long-term investors. We're not focused on how occupancy plays out this quarter versus that quarter, but we're pretty optimistic because of what the underlying trends we see in the marketplace.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMike Mueller: Yeah, hi. Just curious on the Watermark transaction, what was the pricing difference between I guess the entry fee assets versus the rental, just in terms of like a rough cap rate difference?\nShankh Mitra: Mike, we're not going to get into a specific deal, let alone things within the specific deals, right? Obviously as you know how these things play out is that you sign a confidentiality agreement with the seller. We're not going to get into it. We have talked about I believe in the last call that what we like about that transaction is A, the price per unit was very attractive to us; B, some of the underlying land ultimately as you were thinking about real estate investment you have to think about the dart, exceptional dart; and three, we think there is value to be created because of what these assets are and the lands that come with it and what you can do with this only. With all of those three combined we're very excited about the portfolio we got, but we're not going to get into economics of a specific deal, let alone different parts of that deal. That just will put us in a significant violation of a confidential agreement that we have signed.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky from Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nConnor Siversky: Good morning out there. Thanks for having me on the call. I just want to keep this simple, focusing on senior housing in particular in consideration of the value-based investment approach. So in this positive environment for pricing, I mean, do you expect to see some cap rate compression this year on increased competition? And then just how does this change the opportunity set for you? Does that mean more granular transactions or perhaps a restriction in activity on your end or expectations on your end?\nShankh Mitra: Yeah. Connor, I answered this question earlier. I'm just going to repeat what I said. What changed is there's a hard stress that's coming. And that's because majority of construction loans are done on a floating rate basis if not all of them are done on a floating rate basis. And you have a very significant potential increase of LIBOR that's coming to the pipe that will put even more stress in the system. And the second point is we're not cap rate buyers. It is hard to cap rate is a stabilized concept. Senior housing is anywhere but stabilized at this point. I do not expect cap rates even if you're talking about in the context of stabilized cap rate, I do not believe there is going to be a significant compression. In fact, I think a lot of institutional investors are looking at all asset classes including many we own and that we talked about historically that underlying growth rate versus inflation at sudden CapEx makes no sense, right? I've talked about for example for quarters after quarters that given the outlook of what the forward curve was telling you inflation breakeven and others. It made no sense to me for what people who are paying for MOBs with 2% growth rate. Finally, it seems like there is a obviously a understanding on the institutional investor side, people are waking up to say what did I buy for this and how do I make return? So I think there has to be a reconciliation of when you look at your IRR, you have to think about what is the real growth versus the nominal growth. And that's going to show up. That's going to show up at your exit. And we're long-term IRR buyers. We think through these things and that's why we refuse to chase the market. You have seen that for years and years we have done and there was not going to be any difference in that discipline going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: Thanks and good morning. Shankh you have said in the past that you are not likely to be an elephant hunter that you get noise in the system when you go too big and I can appreciate that. But that is a different mentality versus your predecessor. So if you're not willing to be a buyer as an elephant hunter is there anything that you could see from the sales perspective that could be -- I mean if you're a $26 million average deal price on the buy side, what do you think your average deal price would be on the sell side given that mentality towards\u2026\nShankh Mitra: Very good question. It's extremely astute observation. Look at 2020 and look at how many billions we sold. And if you looked at the disposition you will see sales were done on a multiple of the buys, right? I don't know exactly what the number is, but it is likely to be multiple of that $24 million $26 million that we mentioned. We want to buy retail and sell -- buy wholesale and sell retail. That's what we do right?  Fundamentally no matter what investment class you are it's something very simple how you make money is buy low, sell high. Right? That ultimately is how you allocate capital to make money. So portfolio when there's a lot of hunger in the market to buy a certain asset class portfolio premiums that we are. So you go sell portfolios but you buy smaller assets I think we mentioned that $5.7 billion we bought median size of the transaction not median-sized of the building median size of the transaction was $26 million. That's how we create real value. \nOperator: Thank you. So our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski from Green Street. Please go ahead. \nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for the time. John as you picked through the SHOP portfolio either by property type LIL memory care or geography -- are there any signs within the portfolio of structurally higher vacancy rates where maybe move in percentage or just not improving in recent months or occupancy is actually sliding here? \nShankh Mitra: No. Each area is improving across the board. The starting point that we're at right now is of course pretty low. So, the bar is low to build from as we get to an optimal level which would be substantially higher your question is a good question and there may be some things that become more apparent. But at this point in time everything is working across the Board.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nMichael Carroll: Thanks. I wanted to transition to the triple-net portfolio for a second. Tim can you quantify how many triple-net tenants are on a cash basis today? And what's the difference between the current cash that's being paid and recognized compared contractual rents on those leases? \nTim McHugh: So in the first quarter -- or sorry the fourth quarter it's about 15% to 20%. It's kind of stayed within that range for most of the last few quarters. So that's the quantum of kind of how much of that in-place rent is being recognized on a cash basis. And I don't have the gap to contractual right now. \nShankh Mitra: But Mike remember, all of our triple-net senior housing portfolio is in US and UK, right? And Syou can see how much that cash flow is sort of inflected or expected to be inflected this year, because they're obviously on cash, the underlying NOI is what we eat and that underlying NOI is going up significantly, which is translating into that same-store triple-net growth expectation that Tim just gave you. In other words, we took the hit by putting it obviously on cash recognition Tim talked about that, on many calls. Now, we're on the other side of that.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So with all your commentary on the labor expense that was definitely helpful. I guess, I'm curious for the $30 million of the agency labor expense absorbed in the fourth quarter. Is there any further color on whether that was fairly evenly spread geographically across the SHOP portfolio, or did you find it as geographically concentrated maybe in a few markets? And also, since well has more of an urban footprint in SHOP overall. Just any generalization from your view whether labor shortage issues are more or less prevalent in rule versus urban markets just in general? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Sure. That's a great question, and we've done an awful lot of studies on that particular issue leveraging our data analytics team. The interesting thing that, we found is it gets back to my comment on stress identifies opportunities and issues. And when looking at it closely, clearly, some markets can have a level of stress specific to that market. But then when you dig deeper in you find out that, tremendous amount of assets have zero labor and selected assets have a lot of agency \u2013 selective assets have a lot of agency. The cause of that is a combination of in some cases Omicron came in and had a material impact on a great amount of staff, which is no surprise. In other cases, my belief frankly is a leadership. And that's partly, what gives me great optimism in moving forward and solving this, because the leadership issues are solvable. And the leadership issues, this is one indication, but they also tie to other issues occupancy et cetera. So this frankly helps us identify some situations that will \u2013 as we make adjustments, we'll improve things going forward dramatically. So hopefully, that's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, guys. Good morning.\nShankh Mitra: Good morning.\nJordan Sadler: Good morning. I wanted to \u2013 this is sort of a little bit of a two-parter. One I wanted to clarify, the contract labor assumption embedded in 1Q. I think you said down 10%. So $30 million of expense becomes $27 million. Is that the way to think about it? And then separately, just kind of thinking about the cadence of your guidance for the SHOP portfolio in particular, right? Last time, you gave sequential guidance for 4Q, right? We ended up with a surprise variant late in the quarter that ended up providing pretty significant headwinds, especially on the labor front and pressured numbers lower relative to what original expectations were. I'm curious, how much that experience in the fourth quarter impacted sort of your decision surrounding guidance for the first quarter? In other words, this appears kind of conservative relative to the moderation in expenses? And what seems to be a flat occupancy assumption for the first quarter overall, despite the fact that you only lost 20 basis points in January. So I know that's -- I've asked a lot there, but I'm basically asking about the cadence on giving guidance.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So, Jordan, why don't I start and Tim will finish. First is, I understand Q1 is seasonally a weak period from an occupancy standpoint. So as John talked about, we're down in January about 20 basis points. And we're kind of thinking obviously, the sales activity picked up pretty significantly, tours have picked up. And we're thinking as sales picked up you get some lag, right, call it 20 to 30 days lag from sales to occupancy. So that kind of puts you at sort of towards the end of the quarter. So you don't have a lot of time to pick up that occupancy, right? So that sort of -- I wouldn't call that a conservative, right? I would call that what we think was going to happen. The up and downs and who cares. But just sort of generally speaking, I want you to understand what we're thinking about. You are right, I mean, that will on average, quarter average, Q1, occupancy goes down about 70, 80 basis points. So you get sequentially flat, which will probably put an average of flat significant year-over-year growth. That's a pretty good outcome, because you have to think about what that means for the rest of the year, right? It's not about just Q1 days. The second point is, look, I mean, I am pretty disappointed about the bottom line results in Q4. There's no two ways about it. We did not expect that Omicron will hit us like the way it did. And frankly speaking, there's 45 more days to go in the quarter. And as we have seen, it's highly infectious where it comes and how that can impact you quarter-to-quarter, Jordan, who knows, right? I mean we're focused on what's the real run rate earnings power of the platform. And what we see is pretty exciting, at least, what we see today. But it's hard to get into specifics or when things happen. You have an operating business, right, which is driving the marginal differences, try to get very, very sort of prescriptive about how exactly things are going to play out. It's hard to comment.\nTim McHugh: I would just add to the labor piece of that agency piece, Jordan. So your math is correct on the expectation, kind of the step down. And I don't think what happened in the fourth quarter necessarily changes, certainly, very carefully is anywhere, like, conservative in the way that we're forecasting. But the variance in what we've seen happen over the wave is that, the labor disruption has been much greater than the demand disruption, particularly over the last two waves and Omicron was a significant labor disruption. So, certainly, changes the way you forecast from the inputs and confidence levels around it. So that being conservative, it's more of a -- there's a lot of uncertainty in the short term. It's the labor piece and how it's impacting labor market, it being -- the different variants is probably the biggest reason why we have to make a longer-term forecast right now. So, I think, as I said earlier, I think the early trends we're seeing in January are very supportive of our view on the step down in agency. And we thought that was going to be a little bit more back half of the quarter weighted. But, I think, in general, it still stands a pretty good assumption.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Yulico: Hi. Thanks. I just want to follow up here on this agency question. So, it sounds like it's going to be about $27 million for those costs in the first quarter. If you go back to the third quarter, I think, it was $20 million. So still up versus then? And just trying to hear a little bit more about your assumption for why at some point that expense which is about 3% of your expenses goes away and why you're confident that it's a COVID issue and not a tight labor market issue that's driving the use of that agency cost. \nShankh Mitra: Well, it's both. No doubt about it, it's both. And when you look at the fourth quarter some more color on that is you've got some health care workers all of the health care workers who have worked unbelievably, they tirelessly worked and did not take PTO for a long, long period of time. So, you had increased PTOs that occurred around the holiday season and then you add in Omicron and you get the result of agency. So, agency is usually two to three times the rate and it got as high as 6x. It's surge pricing kind of like Uber. So, as that backs away that will lower the expense regardless of the hours. But again going back to my comments the reality is each of the operators have workflows in play to increase hiring and they're all working. So, it was just a unique situation. The combination of the PTO and Omicron that came. So, I am confident that it won't be a long-term item in the industry. But exactly how it abates is it will be over time.\nNick Yulico: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nTayo Okusanya: Yes, hi everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the Rubin Brothers transaction. I'm intrigued by it to kind of given again the high-quality assets that they tend to own over here in the UK. Curious how big that JV could become over time all the idea is you're going to be building stuff like the Sunrise assets at 56th and 2nd right in Central London? Is that the idea there?\nShankh Mitra: The idea is to expand the JV to reflect the fact that UK society is aging just like US society is aging and there is a lack of high-quality product. If you think about Rubin own a lot of extraordinary prime lands and billings obviously around the United Kingdom. And we're looking at a lot of opportunities to grow the platform and that could include trophy assets just like you mentioned that Sunrise at East 56th Street, which by the way opened this quarter and is doing pretty well. If you are in New York, you want to visit the asset let us know. Finally, through all the noise of the COVID and we're seeing some very early demand story there, which is playing out pretty well. But it can be, but doesn't have to be just trophy assets.\nTayo Okusanya: Got you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our last question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Bernstein: Good morning. I have to ask a question here last second. So you talked about ramping up their development team. And when I was looking at your slide in your supplemental, it pretty noticeable that you only have three MOB properties under development almost everything else is seniors housing. So I was hoping you might be able to talk about on the MOB side, whether the lack of development there is more lack of opportunity versus the lack of value and certainly on the acquisition side, you talked about an inflationary environment you don't want to buy four or five cap assets with 2% growth. But on the development side is there a different story there?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So, a couple of things. First, is our MOB pipeline is actually pretty meaningful. I don't know then what's in the south versus what's been reported and not reported. I can tell you that the MOB pipeline is very, very significant. It's 1 million plus square feet that's fully leased. So it's probably not been reported yet. What you see is reported as a senior housing is because we don't separate out what senior housing for while it was housing business, it's all reported as one bucket. But a very substantial portion of our development activity is all the wellness side of the house, rather than on the senior side of the house. On the senior side of the house, they're very targeted, but they're very large buildings, right? So think about -- I'll give you an example. I mean, is 56 Street, which is delivered that's a $300 million asset. You think about 1001 Van Ness that's roughly a $300 million asset. Hudson Yards is a $400-plus million asset. Brooklyn is $150 million assets, right? We talked about Kisco, it's $170 million assets talking about too. So, you have very few assets there that is substantial, that does make a difference to the number. But from a number of properties perspective, they're actually not that high. And the reason being, frankly speaking, other than very special situations, right? Think about where 1001 Van Ness, it's going to be the most trophy building in San Francisco period and full stop. I think about Brooklyn, now the fact that we got something entitled in Brooklyn in Middle a Fisher Hill, right next to the Brooklyn Country Club that should have taken probably 15 years to do, right? So just -- so it's a special opportunity. And that's why we're executing. But other than that, senior housing development today in my opinion doesn't make a lot of sense. And the reason, it doesn't make a lot of sense is you don't know where the ultimate labor cost adjusted rent will land. You just don't know that. And there is no reason to go and guess that. And just obviously if you're doing for your own capital if you're a for-fee developer or a fee-only operator, which is mostly the people who are I'm seeing starting that help in these days because they have no money on the line, right? If it works out, it's great. I have a promote if it doesn't, somebody else lost money. So I just don't see how that works particularly in the context of very high cost and higher financing costs, right? So it just goes back to my point that I made earlier on LIBOR based and floating rate base construction loan industry. So we are thinking about giving you additional disclosure sometime this year about what's the wellness side of the house versus the senior side of the house and we'll get to that. But majority of our new activity is on the wellness side of the house where we're a lot more confident on where the margin lands and frankly speaking their cap rates are much, much, much tighter to create value on the acquisition side, so our focus on the development. And you're going to see as I said the pipeline is very strong on the development side and that's just coming through. I said -- I'll finish it by saying what you have said on that question a very important one, I still -- no one has explained me how someone makes money in a significant inflationary environment on a real basis, not on a nominal basis with an asset class that grows 2% with a 40% cap rate when your inflation is much higher. So somebody's yet to explain me that. And unless I believe that will not be active on the acquisition side. You saw we bought a small MOB portfolio, which was a high-quality portfolio in Arbor we bought. We bought it at a 5.5 cap, which I have said for multiple years, it gives you the right level of IRR.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's Q&A session and today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on the performance of our management operating segments in the quarter. Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our outpatient medical segment delivered 2.4% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, despite a 20 basis point decline in occupancy. We continue to see strong retention rates at 86% in the fourth quarter and with increasing construction costs and rising market rates, we will continue to push renewal rates in exchange and accept the reasonable level of increased turnover and related frictional vacancy as we maximize the value of the portfolio. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. The strong demand-based recovery in the senior housing business continues to strengthen. The show portfolio same-store revenue increased 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing the first full period of year-over-year same-store revenue growth since the beginning of the pandemic. Occupancy grew 90 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Again, the first year-over-year increase in occupancy since the beginning of the pandemic and the largest year-over-year gain for any quarter since 2016. Sequentially, the show portfolio spot occupancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the fourth quarter to 77.7%. Compounding these strong occupancy trends is a notable shift in pricing power. Over the second half of the year, operators have successfully raised and are again able to charge community raised rates and are again able to charge community fees, both of which were reflected in a 3.4% year-over-year increase in RevPAR during the quarter. And following, an outsized increases on January and February renewals with little to no pushback we expect further acceleration in RevPAR growth over the course of the year. Geographically, each of our markets Canada, the UK, and the US are showing improvement in same-store top line metrics through the quarter. Our Canadian portfolio, which has lagged the recovery, posted a year-over-year revenue decline of 3% in Q4 2021. However, the revenue decline improved intra-quarter moving from a decline of 4.2% in October 2021, to a decline of 1.4% in December 2021, compared to the prior year's respective months. Sequentially, the Canadian same-store portfolio grew at a revenue rate of 1.8% in the fourth quarter. In the UK, our same-store revenue increased 7.8% during the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, accelerating from 7.1% growth in October of 2021 to 9% in December of 2021, compared to the prior year's respective months. Finally, in the US, where the majority of our portfolio is located, year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 6.3%. The acceleration in revenue growth was particularly pronounced in the US, accelerating from 3.8% in October 2021, versus the prior year's month to 9.1% in December. Despite these encouraging top line trends, expenses increased 8.8% year-over-year driven largely by excessive agency cost. The combination of holiday time off and Omicron disruption led to an increase in agency costs in the quarter, almost 4.5 times agency expense versus the prior year's quarter. Excluding agency costs, expenses increased 5.3%. Stress and Systems highlights opportunities and issues and the extreme stress in the health care system brought on by COVID has identified some opportunities to improve the value proposition for our hard-working health care workers. The agencies have been a temporary crush, which will provide a short-term option for both operators and the health care workers. That said, the excessive use of agencies is truly short term in nature, and the exceptional premiums that they charge as much as six times, the base rate during the recent holiday period do not pass through to the agency employees, who typically do not receive benefits either. The quality of life and their work experience is substantially less desirable than that of a permanent employee. Agency employees lack the connection to their coworkers, and customers that they desire as they travel from site to site, city to city, and state to state on a daily basis, often away from their families. Additionally, agency employees are less efficient, as they do not know the systems nor the processes of the operator or the site, nor the specific customer requirement. Our operators have many workflows underway at this time to improve the value proposition for permanent employees, which were bearing fruit prior to the Omicron. Nonetheless, the results of these outsized expenses was a decline in same-store NOI of 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, but still marked an improvement from Q3 2021, with over 50% of operators delivering positive NOI growth for the period. The recovery continues to strengthen despite recent Omicron disruption and we remain confident in our ability to drive significant NOI growth in 2022. Through January, agency labor expense has declined as staff cases have fallen. Agency labor expense is expected to moderate further through the first half of 2022 and declined substantially in the second half of 2022. The other disruption caused by Omicron was a record cancellation of tourists, which Sean described. However, at this point, weekly staff cases are down 81% from their peak including an 89% drop in the US and we are seeing operations normalize. The disruption of tours and sales caused occupancy to fall about 20 basis points in January. However with the high level of traffic, we expect that the continued occupancy gains will return and that we will regain lost occupancy by the end of the quarter. Here are some quotes from our operators about the strength of traffic and deposits. \u201cDigital inquiries were up 36% over 2019 in the fourth quarter and continued strong in January\u201d. And \u201cour four-week averages for inquiries tours and deposits are the highest they've been since August of 2021, we are seeing week-over-week growth in deposits of 10%, the last four weeks running\u201d. We are experiencing the strongest January for inquiries in several years. And finally \u201cour inquiries from the last week alone have been the highest numbers we've ever experienced\u201d. In closing, I have shifted from full immersion in the business to planning in action. I'm even more excited about the future opportunities across the Welltower platform. We are leveraging our proprietary data analytics platform and operationalizing the data to drive results. This process is occurring right now as we have several workflows underway, which we expect to bear fruit in the immediate future as well as many more workflows that we expect to drive our outperformance in the quarters and years to come. I continue to be appreciative of the warm welcome and excitement expressed by our operators as we leverage our combined real estate operating company and care experience to improve the customer and employee experience and drive financial results. Each operator has a unique expertise and opportunities. We have been working very well together and offering support where needed from implementing best practices to applying data analytics to improve their business. In one case, we identified a software tool over 25 years old. As they say, the '90s called and they want their deeper back. I'm confident there is a substantial opportunity to implement operational excellence across the board and bringing the basic back office and sales operations up to match the high quality of care the operators are delivering, which will drive significant margin growth in the years to come. I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Yes. No. Thank you, Nick. No, my expectation is that the business will at least get back to historical standards where agency was a small part of the whole picture just was an assistance piece. But frankly, with the workflows going on I think it's a very strong chance that agency diminishes even further because what has changed is the world has gone from a situation where there's an abundance of employees to a scarcity of employees. And so the employers now the good one to have recognized that fundamentally changed how they look at things. Recruiting has become a sales machine with KPIs for the recruiters, et cetera. The value proposition has changed dramatically. People are looking at what the employee experience is words that would never set employee experience you don't hear that. They're looking at that and they're trying to figure out how to optimize. So some changes that are going on are people are realizing like, hey, we should change your hours slightly for some employees, because they have to drop their children off at school. They can't work here, because of when we start not a big deal for us, move it an hour and it works perfectly for them. A lot of things like that are changing. So I think from my perspective, it's great for the hardworking health care employees. It will be great for the operators. And will further diminish the agencies. But it will take time for this to tail off, as I mentioned in my comments, so it won't happen overnight. But I think long run, run rate will be great. Yeah. So I'm going to \u2013 on the \u2013 you managed to get two questions there and that was good. On the \u2013 on the re-leasing versus the market, clearly, net effective markets are up significantly. They were concessions and community fees that \u2013 well concessions that were given community fees that were waived that's all reversed itself. And so certainly, at one point if you go back in the industry, market rents were below in place that's now changing. And from an in-place perspective and overall the rents are moving up pretty significantly. Very consistent with the comments that Sean made previously, with the expectations of mid-5%s to 10% in that zone. What we're seeing is a lot of strength in the marketplace and a recognition that cost gap come up and it takes a certain amount of money to provide great care and that's what people want."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt and good morning everyone. I'll review the quarter, reflect back on 2021 on this year-end call, walk you through high-level business trends, and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the operational environment for show and MOB portfolios and Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights, and first quarter guidance. 2021 was a year marked by high conviction capital deployment, partner and talent acquisition, and a powerful inflection in our senior housing business. Our belief in the long-term demand thesis for the senior housing proved out as we witnessed significant occupancy growth starting in the spring of last year which continued through the historically seasonally weak winter season. Just as importantly, in the second half of 2021, we began to see a significant shift in the pricing power. Interestingly, we found these pricing power during a period of relatively low occupancy levels. After all what industry or asset class do you know of that is able to achieve pricing power with occupancy levels in the low 70% range. Low behold that pricing power continued to strengthen in Q4 and in the first quarter of this year despite the impact of Delta and Omicron. Same-store RevPAR grew 3.4% in Q4 falling year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 4.8% one of the strongest quarter in the company's history. And even more encouraging is the revenue growth in US exceeded 6% with the momentum accelerating through fourth quarter. John will walk you through the details in a moment. Though I am not happy with our soft par bottom-line results due to increased expenses mainly from the Omicron induced labor crisis, I continue to believe we will see significant improvement throughout the year given the continued net hiring trends we're seeing from our operating partners. This assumes we don't experience a highly infectious variant. We can offset the higher cost of full-time employees just as we have done during the years prior to COVID, it is a significant presence of contract labor at search pricing level that is a source of the issue. From a demand standpoint, we saw record interest in our product in Q4 that continued through January with inquiries up significantly from December. However, a meaningful number of tours got canceled or postponed as either the prospective resident or their family got COVID or a community that did not have enough employees to conduct the tour as there was a COVID crisis in the communities. However, the tours have picked up meaningfully in recent weeks and we are starting to see strong sales activity, which should translate into higher net move-ins in next three to four weeks. If we are right about this, you may see occupancy growth exceed seasonal trends, while occurring in an environment of strong rate growth. We project this will put us into the double-digit NOI growth range in Q1 only to accelerate further throughout the year. As disappointed as I am about the diminished bottom line flow-through in Q4, due to $30 million of agency costs compared to only $5 million in Q1 of last year, I continue to believe that our 2022 exit run rate and 2023 earnings power of this platform is unchanged. Moving to capital allocation. In 2021, we deployed $5.7 billion across great real estate, with fantastic operator and at even a better price. The most incredible aspect of this story was the granular nature of execution with a median transaction size of $26 million. We're not believers in elephant hunting, as larger transactions usually result in value accruing to the seller. As you know, we manage this company for our long-term shareholders to increase our share value. Q4 was no exception to this consistent trend. We have deployed $1.4 billion of capital in Q4 across 20 separate transactions with a median size of $24 million. I won't bore you with the details of every transaction, but I would be remiss not to mention a couple of them, which I'm particularly proud of, including a handful of trophy buildings in Boston and Florida at a very attractive basis. But perhaps the most exciting investment of the quarter was the formation of our partnership with Andy and Glynn at Quality Senior Living, or QSL. It is hard to overstate how strong of a team, Andy and Glynn have built from conceptualization of the product, to development execution and ultimately their operational excellence. For example, despite all the labor challenges that I've highlighted, QSL have used virtually no agency labor and their buildings are well occupied. Andy who is one of the biggest users of our data analytics platform is embarking on a multi-year effort to expand the Blake brand with the full support of our platform behind him. I hope you are seeing a pattern here with how our data and predictive analytics platform attracts some of the best people in the business, as we offer so much more than capital. This network effect of platform execution across multi-year partnership that were formed over the last few years will fuel our growth for years to come. As Delta and Omicron induce challenges, we had that ugly head in Q4, capital deployment opportunity set only expanded and that continued in Q1, which is seasonally the weakest quarter from a deal activity. With -- after a strong close of 2021, we have already closed an approximately $600 million of the investment over the last six weeks. And I'm pleased to report that our pipeline remains robust, highly visible and actionable. While the capital market backdrops remain volatile of late driven primarily by the Fed headlines, we're well positioned to fund our pipeline with well over $1 billion of equity and availability of liquidity in excess of $4 billion. We're proud of our capital allocation track record both deployment and sourcing. But if capital markets volatility continues, we will access different tools from our toolbox, as we have done before. Lastly, I'm very proud to announce our new partnership with Reuben Brothers, which is buying Avery Healthcare, one of our largest operating partner. Rubin Brothers founded by David and Simon Rubin is one of the largest family offices in the world and is the owner of prime real estate and infrastructure both in UK and globally. There are also a pioneer of investing in alternative real estate and infrastructure as an early investor and owner of Global Switch. Rubin Brothers share our optimism for the exceptional growth trajectory for health care and wellness infrastructure as society ages. We're particularly excited about the prospect of expanding the platform together as Rubin Brothers owns some of the most prime land and real estate in the UK. Tim and I have said on this call many times that temporary degradation of cash flow doesn't necessarily mean the extraction of value, Avery, which constitutes 16% of our same-store triple net NOI will be significantly delevered through this equity infusion from Rubin Brothers. Partnering with highly sophisticated global investors like Rubin Brothers validates our view of the long-term value of this business despite Wall Street's obsession with point-to-time coverage. In conclusion, I'm very proud to -- of our execution in 2021 across operations, capital allocation and partnership. The stage is set for multiyear earnings growth as we find ourselves at the bottom of both secular and cyclical cycles with unparalleled platform built with advanced data analytics 20 or so growth vehicles with different partners and talent to execute on it. The pandemic has been devastating for our entire ecosystem, but we have doubled down during this massive disruption given our high conviction investment thesis. You as our shareholders can rest assured that we'll not be resting on our laurels and that will continue to dig deeper and wider moat. With that, I'll pass it over to John. John? Thanks, Tim. I wanted to conclude this call by addressing something that you -- we usually don't talk about and that is our comprehensive team. We have completed -- completely overhauled and upgraded our team and this was a multi-year effort building out new areas such as predictive analytics to create a truly scalable platform. With extremely low volunteer turnover, we continue to hire the best and the brightest to further deepen our capital allocation expertise. Historically, the majority of the alpha we created have been through astute raising or deployment of capital. Over the last 15 months, though, we have also built out an industry-leading and, frankly, a very significant development team under the leadership of Mike Ferry and Ayesha Menon. The last piece of this puzzle is building out our operational excellence and asset management capabilities. This started with the hiring of John in 2021. John is building out a world-class team that will accelerate value creation for our shareholders for years to come. We have added a net 51 people last year and we're likely to add another 80 new colleagues in 2022. Many of you who follow our company closely understand that our asset platform is like a coil spring today. We spent heavily during the pandemic, but most of these assets are sitting with low occupancy and thus cash flow, which is about to be released and surge forward to realize its full value. Similarly the people side of our business platform is also a coil spring today. You are only seeing them in G&A line, but their full contribution to the revenue line will be seen in 2023 and beyond. With that, operator, please open up the call for questions. Fantastic question Jonathan. As I said right now I can think of two operators that in US particularly -- this is a US-specific comment and they'll probably be the same for UK and Canada, that I can think of two specific operators that we don't have relationship today that I want to have a relationship. One of them we already have had shaken our hands this quarter and likely probably we're going to talk about it next quarter's call. So, what you are likely to see that means is we generally have the operator base the platform that we wanted to build. You would recall that before pandemic we talked about with you that we have a map, right? And in that map we have different ideas of where the different types of acuities of assets should be and what kind of operator should be running those, right? We kind of generally feel out that map. Now, what you're going to see we're going to go deep. Instead of going broad which you have seen over the last, call it 18 to 24 months, you're going to see us go very deep. And that sort of talks about -- we have a slide on our presentation you can see that we talked about give or take this 25 to 30 relationships across all asset classes not just senior housing, senior housing, medical office, and wireless housing. All three platforms that we are growing pretty significantly that we think creates a very significant opportunity of external and growth that we estimate could be an upwards of $2.5 billion, $3 billion a year for a decade to come. But that's sort of how we're thinking about it. It's going deep instead of going broad but we'll talk about hopefully another exceptional operator relationship next quarter. Vikram, to answer your second question, we are getting you back to the pre-COVID margin on that slide. I think you're referring to slide 17. There is no question that, if you have pricing power that will improve. But remember, you also have higher labor cost. So to the extent that, you have higher pricing power in excess of higher labor costs, you will see upside to that margin. But it is getting you back to margin Q4 of 2019 margin for the portfolio that was there in Q4 of 2019. Has anything changed? The answer is, yes. So if you think about, what we have been saying that, we are mostly focused on what we have been buying \u2013 as you can see the average age of those assets would indicate, they are the children of supply over cycle of 15 to 19, right? What you had is disruption from the revenue side because of all these variants. Then you had a disruption from the cost side because of our employee situation that we talk about. Something changed there, yes something has in the last call it 45 days. And that is what you didn't have is the pressure from financing cost. All construction loans are made on LIBOR, right? Pretty much all construction loans, a variable LIBOR-based loan. And obviously, if you look at the \u2013 how the outlook for Fed has changed over the last call it 45 to 60 days, you can imagine that third pressure is just about to come which is higher financing cost. So something has changed. And now going back is this a level of acquisition possible or beatable. The answer to that question is very simple. We're not a volume-driven investor. We're a value-driven investor. If the volume is there to create part share value we will do it. If not, we will not do it. That's just a simple how to allocate capital. The success of a team is not measured at least our team in our opinion is not the growth of the enterprise but part share value creation for existing shareholders. So as long as that opportunity is there we'll absolutely do it. Yes. Thanks, Steve. So on the revenue side we're assuming 420 basis points of occupancy increase on a year-over-year basis driving that 10% revenue growth. So the remainder of that revenue growth is being driven by rate. And on the expense side, I think the best way to look at it is sequentially, we're talking a lot about agency labor. We are assuming a sequential reduction in agency labor about 10% from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in that pool. And that's supported by early trends we've seen in the quarter. Hey, Rich. John just talked about that. The street rate comments I made is a net effective rent. And you are seeing because obviously, the concessions that were given, the lack of community fees that you had, the effective net street rate is moving up because of that. Not necessarily, the pace is moving but the net effective rent is moving, we continue to see. In fact we have seen some \u2013 a couple of our operators have now moved street rate at Well [ph] In-Place rent, a couple of our very large operators have gotten much closer. So it's a pretty encouraging sort of it as we look in the future. Tim just walked you through at our 10% guidance, means, from a rate and occupancy perspective. And that sort of gives you the second answer to that question, right? So we are a shop. We're focused on ultimately optimization of revenue, not necessarily one component of the revenue. And on top of that you have to think about, one component of the revenue comes with higher cost, which is labor, right, if you just occupancy, which obviously rate doesn't. So we're trying to optimize all of those things together and that sort of blends to what we talked about which is a 10-ish percent revenue growth in Q1, 15% NOI growth in Q1, and that NOI growth should continue to accelerate as we get to the year for two reasons, right? One is, as you build occupancy, you will get obviously your marginal margin will expand obviously, right? So that's one point. Second, you will get a continuation of sort of burn-off of the agency labor that you got. So that's sort of two of these things together, you will get an acceleration of NOI growth as we get to the second half of the year. Yes. So, first, you said the magic word, excluding any more new variants, right? So that's a very important what you mentioned there. And despite that I'm not going to venture a guess of what it will look like. I will tell you there are a couple of things to think about. Last year you got a massive disruption in Q1. You've got a significant occupancy loss, you started at a big hole and you had to climb up that hole to get to a point where on an average basis you can build out documents. So you don't have that problem this year, right? John talked about January, our occupancy from point to point is down 20 basis points, which is probably will make this January the best January we ever had seasonality perspective. So, you don't have a hole to climb out. Second, you have better demographics this year. You can see the demographics is building. So we have more demand there and that's sort of playing out for all the leads and other data that John disclosed on his script card, you have a significantly lower number of deliveries this year, right? So -- and then if you -- under your assumption if we don't get hit by four waves like we did last year, and hopefully, that will translate into better occupancy growth. I'm not going to comment on any specific operator or try to sort of venture a guess of what entire year is going to look like. However, the table is set. If all of these things we just discussed lay out, we'll see a better year. But we're long-term investors. We're not focused on how occupancy plays out this quarter versus that quarter, but we're pretty optimistic because of what the underlying trends we see in the marketplace. Mike, we're not going to get into a specific deal, let alone things within the specific deals, right? Obviously as you know how these things play out is that you sign a confidentiality agreement with the seller. We're not going to get into it. We have talked about I believe in the last call that what we like about that transaction is A, the price per unit was very attractive to us; B, some of the underlying land ultimately as you were thinking about real estate investment you have to think about the dart, exceptional dart; and three, we think there is value to be created because of what these assets are and the lands that come with it and what you can do with this only. With all of those three combined we're very excited about the portfolio we got, but we're not going to get into economics of a specific deal, let alone different parts of that deal. That just will put us in a significant violation of a confidential agreement that we have signed. Yeah. Connor, I answered this question earlier. I'm just going to repeat what I said. What changed is there's a hard stress that's coming. And that's because majority of construction loans are done on a floating rate basis if not all of them are done on a floating rate basis. And you have a very significant potential increase of LIBOR that's coming to the pipe that will put even more stress in the system. And the second point is we're not cap rate buyers. It is hard to cap rate is a stabilized concept. Senior housing is anywhere but stabilized at this point. I do not expect cap rates even if you're talking about in the context of stabilized cap rate, I do not believe there is going to be a significant compression. In fact, I think a lot of institutional investors are looking at all asset classes including many we own and that we talked about historically that underlying growth rate versus inflation at sudden CapEx makes no sense, right? I've talked about for example for quarters after quarters that given the outlook of what the forward curve was telling you inflation breakeven and others. It made no sense to me for what people who are paying for MOBs with 2% growth rate. Finally, it seems like there is a obviously a understanding on the institutional investor side, people are waking up to say what did I buy for this and how do I make return? So I think there has to be a reconciliation of when you look at your IRR, you have to think about what is the real growth versus the nominal growth. And that's going to show up. That's going to show up at your exit. And we're long-term IRR buyers. We think through these things and that's why we refuse to chase the market. You have seen that for years and years we have done and there was not going to be any difference in that discipline going forward. Very good question. It's extremely astute observation. Look at 2020 and look at how many billions we sold. And if you looked at the disposition you will see sales were done on a multiple of the buys, right? I don't know exactly what the number is, but it is likely to be multiple of that $24 million $26 million that we mentioned. We want to buy retail and sell -- buy wholesale and sell retail. That's what we do right?  Fundamentally no matter what investment class you are it's something very simple how you make money is buy low, sell high. Right? That ultimately is how you allocate capital to make money. So portfolio when there's a lot of hunger in the market to buy a certain asset class portfolio premiums that we are. So you go sell portfolios but you buy smaller assets I think we mentioned that $5.7 billion we bought median size of the transaction not median-sized of the building median size of the transaction was $26 million. That's how we create real value. No. Each area is improving across the board. The starting point that we're at right now is of course pretty low. So, the bar is low to build from as we get to an optimal level which would be substantially higher your question is a good question and there may be some things that become more apparent. But at this point in time everything is working across the Board. But Mike remember, all of our triple-net senior housing portfolio is in US and UK, right? And Syou can see how much that cash flow is sort of inflected or expected to be inflected this year, because they're obviously on cash, the underlying NOI is what we eat and that underlying NOI is going up significantly, which is translating into that same-store triple-net growth expectation that Tim just gave you. In other words, we took the hit by putting it obviously on cash recognition Tim talked about that, on many calls. Now, we're on the other side of that. Sure. That's a great question, and we've done an awful lot of studies on that particular issue leveraging our data analytics team. The interesting thing that, we found is it gets back to my comment on stress identifies opportunities and issues. And when looking at it closely, clearly, some markets can have a level of stress specific to that market. But then when you dig deeper in you find out that, tremendous amount of assets have zero labor and selected assets have a lot of agency \u2013 selective assets have a lot of agency. The cause of that is a combination of in some cases Omicron came in and had a material impact on a great amount of staff, which is no surprise. In other cases, my belief frankly is a leadership. And that's partly, what gives me great optimism in moving forward and solving this, because the leadership issues are solvable. And the leadership issues, this is one indication, but they also tie to other issues occupancy et cetera. So this frankly helps us identify some situations that will \u2013 as we make adjustments, we'll improve things going forward dramatically. So hopefully, that's helpful. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. So, Jordan, why don't I start and Tim will finish. First is, I understand Q1 is seasonally a weak period from an occupancy standpoint. So as John talked about, we're down in January about 20 basis points. And we're kind of thinking obviously, the sales activity picked up pretty significantly, tours have picked up. And we're thinking as sales picked up you get some lag, right, call it 20 to 30 days lag from sales to occupancy. So that kind of puts you at sort of towards the end of the quarter. So you don't have a lot of time to pick up that occupancy, right? So that sort of -- I wouldn't call that a conservative, right? I would call that what we think was going to happen. The up and downs and who cares. But just sort of generally speaking, I want you to understand what we're thinking about. You are right, I mean, that will on average, quarter average, Q1, occupancy goes down about 70, 80 basis points. So you get sequentially flat, which will probably put an average of flat significant year-over-year growth. That's a pretty good outcome, because you have to think about what that means for the rest of the year, right? It's not about just Q1 days. The second point is, look, I mean, I am pretty disappointed about the bottom line results in Q4. There's no two ways about it. We did not expect that Omicron will hit us like the way it did. And frankly speaking, there's 45 more days to go in the quarter. And as we have seen, it's highly infectious where it comes and how that can impact you quarter-to-quarter, Jordan, who knows, right? I mean we're focused on what's the real run rate earnings power of the platform. And what we see is pretty exciting, at least, what we see today. But it's hard to get into specifics or when things happen. You have an operating business, right, which is driving the marginal differences, try to get very, very sort of prescriptive about how exactly things are going to play out. It's hard to comment. Well, it's both. No doubt about it, it's both. And when you look at the fourth quarter some more color on that is you've got some health care workers all of the health care workers who have worked unbelievably, they tirelessly worked and did not take PTO for a long, long period of time. So, you had increased PTOs that occurred around the holiday season and then you add in Omicron and you get the result of agency. So, agency is usually two to three times the rate and it got as high as 6x. It's surge pricing kind of like Uber. So, as that backs away that will lower the expense regardless of the hours. But again going back to my comments the reality is each of the operators have workflows in play to increase hiring and they're all working. So, it was just a unique situation. The combination of the PTO and Omicron that came. So, I am confident that it won't be a long-term item in the industry. But exactly how it abates is it will be over time. The idea is to expand the JV to reflect the fact that UK society is aging just like US society is aging and there is a lack of high-quality product. If you think about Rubin own a lot of extraordinary prime lands and billings obviously around the United Kingdom. And we're looking at a lot of opportunities to grow the platform and that could include trophy assets just like you mentioned that Sunrise at East 56th Street, which by the way opened this quarter and is doing pretty well. If you are in New York, you want to visit the asset let us know. Finally, through all the noise of the COVID and we're seeing some very early demand story there, which is playing out pretty well. But it can be, but doesn't have to be just trophy assets. Yes. So, a couple of things. First, is our MOB pipeline is actually pretty meaningful. I don't know then what's in the south versus what's been reported and not reported. I can tell you that the MOB pipeline is very, very significant. It's 1 million plus square feet that's fully leased. So it's probably not been reported yet. What you see is reported as a senior housing is because we don't separate out what senior housing for while it was housing business, it's all reported as one bucket. But a very substantial portion of our development activity is all the wellness side of the house, rather than on the senior side of the house. On the senior side of the house, they're very targeted, but they're very large buildings, right? So think about -- I'll give you an example. I mean, is 56 Street, which is delivered that's a $300 million asset. You think about 1001 Van Ness that's roughly a $300 million asset. Hudson Yards is a $400-plus million asset. Brooklyn is $150 million assets, right? We talked about Kisco, it's $170 million assets talking about too. So, you have very few assets there that is substantial, that does make a difference to the number. But from a number of properties perspective, they're actually not that high. And the reason being, frankly speaking, other than very special situations, right? Think about where 1001 Van Ness, it's going to be the most trophy building in San Francisco period and full stop. I think about Brooklyn, now the fact that we got something entitled in Brooklyn in Middle a Fisher Hill, right next to the Brooklyn Country Club that should have taken probably 15 years to do, right? So just -- so it's a special opportunity. And that's why we're executing. But other than that, senior housing development today in my opinion doesn't make a lot of sense. And the reason, it doesn't make a lot of sense is you don't know where the ultimate labor cost adjusted rent will land. You just don't know that. And there is no reason to go and guess that. And just obviously if you're doing for your own capital if you're a for-fee developer or a fee-only operator, which is mostly the people who are I'm seeing starting that help in these days because they have no money on the line, right? If it works out, it's great. I have a promote if it doesn't, somebody else lost money. So I just don't see how that works particularly in the context of very high cost and higher financing costs, right? So it just goes back to my point that I made earlier on LIBOR based and floating rate base construction loan industry. So we are thinking about giving you additional disclosure sometime this year about what's the wellness side of the house versus the senior side of the house and we'll get to that. But majority of our new activity is on the wellness side of the house where we're a lot more confident on where the margin lands and frankly speaking their cap rates are much, much, much tighter to create value on the acquisition side, so our focus on the development. And you're going to see as I said the pipeline is very strong on the development side and that's just coming through. I said -- I'll finish it by saying what you have said on that question a very important one, I still -- no one has explained me how someone makes money in a significant inflationary environment on a real basis, not on a nominal basis with an asset class that grows 2% with a 40% cap rate when your inflation is much higher. So somebody's yet to explain me that. And unless I believe that will not be active on the acquisition side. You saw we bought a small MOB portfolio, which was a high-quality portfolio in Arbor we bought. We bought it at a 5.5 cap, which I have said for multiple years, it gives you the right level of IRR."

            "name": "Tim McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2021 results. Performance of our triple-net investment segment in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet and liquidity update and finally our outlook for the first quarter. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of a $0.13 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per diluted share, relative to the guidance of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. Our results included approximately $18 million or $0.04 per diluted share of HHS funds and other out-of-period government grants that were not previously budgeted. Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months at 9/30/2021. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 4.2% year-over-year, driven by improvements in rent collections, on leases currently on cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI. We expect the impact of both these trends to accelerate in 2022. As rent collections improve given that 20% of our leases are subject to API-based escalators. Trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.8x. Looking forward we expect coverages to inflect positively in the first half of 2022 as year-over-year improvement in fundamentals followed the positive trends expected in our senior housing operating portfolio. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 0.8% year-over-year same-store NOI growth. However similar to our senior housing triple net portfolio we expect NOI growth to improve in 2022 through greater rent collections on leases currently in cash recognition as well as CPI-based rent escalators. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.29x. Over the course of 2021 we completed $458 million of long-term post-acute dispositions at a blended cap rate of 8.7%. With an additional $108 million under contract for sale at year-end. As a result, our long-term post-acute portfolio represented just 5.2% of total in-place NOI at year-end versus 10.1% at the end of 2020. A 490 basis point decline driven largely by the exit of our Genesis relationship. And lastly health systems which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System. Had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.39x. The sequential improvement in coverage was driven by the previously announced agreement to sell 25 assets that have been contributing negative EBITDA. As of year-end we completed the sale of 2021 of those assets with the remaining four held for sale. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to capitalize our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, we've sold 11.3 million shares via forward sale agreements at an initial weighted average price $85.06 per share for expected gross proceeds of $961 million. We currently have approximately 11.1 million shares remaining unsettled which are expected to generate future proceeds of $949 million. This is in addition to $220 million of expected property disposition and loan payoff proceeds. During the quarter we also issued $500 million of 10-year unsecured debt maturing in 2032 with a coupon of 2.75%. Following similar discipline in their equity funding strategy this is our third unsecured issuance in 2021, bringing full year issuance to $1.75 billion with an average ratio of 9.5 years and a coupon of 2.6%. At year-end when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. When combined with the previously mentioned $1.2 billion of combined unsettled ATM proceeds and expected disposition proceeds we are in a very strong liquidity position heading into 2022. We ended the fourth quarter with 6.95x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA down slightly from last quarter. Leverage is impacted by the timing of $1.5 billion of net investment activity completed later in the quarter. If we run rate the impact of net investment activity completed in the quarter pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA decreased to 6.75x. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of our top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio with portfolio spot occupancy ending the quarter at 77.7%, 70 basis points higher than the end of the prior quarter, but still 950 basis points below pre-COVID levels. The portfolio also sits 1300 basis points below peak occupancy levels. Setting the stage for a powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside and strong rate growth is coupled with significant margin expansion of a very depressed base. Lastly, moving to our first quarter outlook. Last night we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.17 to $0.22 per share and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.79 to $0.84, or $0.815 at the midpoint. This guidance takes into consideration approximately $6 million or $0.015 per share of HHS funds expected to be received in the first quarter. Excluding the HHS funds, the $0.80 per share midpoint of our first quarter guidance represents a $0.015 sequential increase from an as adjusted $0.785 per share number for 4Q, which excludes $18 million of previously recognized HHS and out-of-period U.K. and Canadian subsidies recognized in the quarter. This $0.015 increase is composed of $0.025 from a sequential increase in senior housing operating portfolio NOI and fourth quarter investment activity and an offset of $0.01 increase of sequential G&A and income taxes. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated first quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth of 7%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 1% to 2% growth; long-term post-acute, 1% to 2%; health systems, 2.75%; senior housing triple-net, 5% to 6%; and finally senior housing operating growth of approximately 15%, driven by revenue growth of 10%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 420 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. So in the first quarter -- or sorry the fourth quarter it's about 15% to 20%. It's kind of stayed within that range for most of the last few quarters. So that's the quantum of kind of how much of that in-place rent is being recognized on a cash basis. And I don't have the gap to contractual right now. I would just add to the labor piece of that agency piece, Jordan. So your math is correct on the expectation, kind of the step down. And I don't think what happened in the fourth quarter necessarily changes, certainly, very carefully is anywhere, like, conservative in the way that we're forecasting. But the variance in what we've seen happen over the wave is that, the labor disruption has been much greater than the demand disruption, particularly over the last two waves and Omicron was a significant labor disruption. So, certainly, changes the way you forecast from the inputs and confidence levels around it. So that being conservative, it's more of a -- there's a lot of uncertainty in the short term. It's the labor piece and how it's impacting labor market, it being -- the different variants is probably the biggest reason why we have to make a longer-term forecast right now. So, I think, as I said earlier, I think the early trends we're seeing in January are very supportive of our view on the step down in agency. And we thought that was going to be a little bit more back half of the quarter weighted. But, I think, in general, it still stands a pretty good assumption."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.

I'll walk you through our high-level business trends and capital allocation priorities. John Burkart, our COO, will walk you through the details, operating environment in SHO and MOB. Tim will walk you through the triple-net businesses, earnings guidance and capitalization. This is Jon's first call as he's beginning to dig into the business. So please go easy on him. Despite mediocre bottom-line results, we cannot be happier with the overall results of the quarter. Just 6 months ago, many industry participants and observers were cautioning if the COVID pandemic would result in apartment impairment of demand for senior housing.  And even most people who believe that the demand would come back were worried that with every surge of the virus, the business would take a significant step back. As it has been our experience that these surges drive revenue down, cost up, resulting in a significant hit to the bottom line. For the first time since the beginning of pandemic, we [Indiscernible] this trend. And despite witnessing a significant surge of the Delta variant after we spoke 3 months ago, we still posted the strongest sequential revenue growth in the Company's history.  Occupancy went up 210 basis points in the quarter relative to our guidance of 190 basis points pre-Delta, and rate growth accelerated resulting in a 3.5% sequential increase in topline revenue across our same-store shop portfolio. Importantly, year-over-year revenue growth inflected positively in the U.S. and UK portfolio for the first time since the beginning of pandemic. This trend accelerated into September when we absorbed a year-over-year revenue increase for the entire portfolio led by U.S. and UK, which reported a year-over-year revenue growth over 2%.  This is particularly impressive in context of a massive Delta surge. Let's reflect on why that might be the case. With nearly all resident vaccinated and stuff vaccination rates approaching 90%, which is substantially higher than general population, prospective residents and their families recognized that our communities are much safer environment than alternative settings. You can see that in our data. In the U.S., despite a tenfold increase in the daily case counts across U.S. in July and August, the number of cases within our short portfolio was just 10% of peak levels observed during the prior surges.  It's similar trend was experienced across our Canadian and UK portfolio for the -- over the same time. This helped us build significant topline momentum in our business as we received the dual benefit of occupancy and rate growth, which we believe will continue into next year. In fact, I believe this trend will meaningfully accelerate into next year as we feel significant momentum in the rate environment. Despite this great top-line performance, our bottom-line performance was mediocre and impacted by a perfect storm across the expense stack.  We had a confluence of extraordinary costs, including agency labor as COVID surged, heightened R&M, insurance costs, utility costs, and other sundry costs, all hitting at the same time. There's also an extra day in the quarter which resulted in a mismatch of revenue and expenses as majority of our operators charge rent on a monthly basis. Additionally, we saw meaningful rise in paid time off as many of the employees took advantage of the easing travel restriction during the summer. The rise of COVID also resulted additional call-off from our team members at the last minute, which drove a significant spike in the use of agency lever, which costs 2X to 3X. This situation was further complicated by the vaccination mandate which the system is currently working through.  The only good deals on the expense overall is that we began to see the situation normalized in October. While it is too early to comment on exactly how long it will take for the situation to fully normalize, we need to unpack what logically will stay with us in the medium to long term and what will dissipate. In our opinion, based way to increases are sticky and they will likely to be here as unit cost of labor. We firmly believe Welltower operating partners will be able to overcome this hurdle through rent increases as they offer a premium product within a premium micro-market. The alternative of one-on-one care just got significantly more expensive.  We are beginning to see the green shoot emerge as operating partners have been -- have seen expansion of labor pool with supplemental unemployment benefits rolling off and children having gone back to school. John will provide more details on this topic. But we believe the usage of agency lever will dissipate going forward. Our guidance for Q4 will suggest that we do not expect this situation to completely reverse primarily because of 3 factors. 1. We have a mismatch of revenue growth and expense growth, as a significant portion of our annual increases happen on [Indiscernible] 1. 2. After you hire people, it takes an extended period of time to go through pre -employment and training process before new employees can hit the floor.  And 3. Delta wave, which peaked in late September, is still with us even in November. However, none of these has changed my view that Welltower stabilized shop margin post-COVID will be higher than that of pre -COVID margin. Even on a near-term basis, I do not believe the earnings power of this portfolio, 2022 exit run rate or 2023 run rate, has changed. I want to repeat that one more time. Even on near-term basis, I don't believe the earnings power of this portfolio's 2022 exit run rate or 2023 run rate has changed. The best operators will rise from these difficult times stronger with significant higher market share while many others will find this business too hard to figure out.  We're engaged in, frankly, starkly different conversation with the management team of operators in this industry more broadly. While everyone is fatigued from the events of the past 18 months, many of our partners are watching with John to rethink how technology, operational excellence, revenue optimization, and data analytics can fundamentally change this business. Think of some very basic question, unit labor is going up, but how many units do we need? Price needs to go up, but how do you differentiate price on units with a view of Central Park versus a brick wall. Many operators within the industry are hoping things will get better on their own. Unfortunately, hope is not a great strategy.  Our intense operational focus translates directly into our capital allocation strategy. Let me restate what that is. We want to own the right assets in the right micro market with the right operator focused on right equity and price point. And we want to own that asset at the right basis. Either we'll buy at a discount to replacement cost, or we'll build at extremely targeted way at replacement costs. While bidding [Indiscernible] are pretty thin, primarily with few first-time or relatively new capital, we remain extraordinarily active in off-market, privately negotiated transactions while we bring unmatched [Indiscernible] to close with operator and cash capital.  As most of this situation are debt maturity driven, nothing is more important to the seller than the certainty of close with a firm handshake. And as you know, our reputation is we don't negotiate, and we don't re-trade after we have a firm handshake. This approach has resulted in one of the most active quarter in the history of our Company. We closed $2 billion of investments at a significant discount to replacement costs with expected IRS in the high single-digit to low double-digit.  We continued our momentum subsequent to the end of third quarter with another $1.3 billion transaction that we have signed the purchase and sale agreement, and that we have described in our press release. While they're all very important transaction, let me highlights the different flavors of the deal. We are excited about a $580 million transaction to buy 8 rental and 6 entrance fee communities in great micro markets. We would recall that we bought a handful of Sunrise CCRC from SNH in 2018. This transaction is very similar in asset quality and location standpoint but at a materially better price.  And the previous owner has spent significant amount of capital over $50 million in the last 5 years. We should be able to achieve a high single-digit on levered IRR as our operating partner Watermark leases of the communities. However, we think we can post this return into double-digit on level IRR category as we execute a higher and better use strategy similar to what we have when we're embarking on our 85 Atria portfolio -- 85 property Atria portfolio. For example, there is an extraordinary piece of land in a highly desirable residential Corridor of Bellevue, Washington that is entitled for high density residential as of right.  We can build a great vertical campus of senior or wellness living there, or sell it to a multi-family developer. For many of these communities that access land, while we intend to build additional cottage size units which are already sold out in this location, you get the flavor. In a separate transaction, we bought five classes senior housing communities in Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic region with an extraordinary partner with an extraordinary operator and development group for a $172 million. The average age of these communities is 3 years. And we expect to generate a high single-digit on levered IRR. We also negotiated a long-term exclusive development contract with this team.  I cannot wait to disclose the details of this group and our growth plan with them on the next call. But here is a teaser. This team has executed flawlessly even during this challenging Q3 without any agency lever. That gives you a sense of their operating prowess. In a similar vein to new building, we bought 3 brand new communities in the Midwest from a multi-family developer with new perspective, our existing operator. On average, these building are 2 years old. We feel our future pipeline is robust as we are on a 2-year line with several other granular transactions.  We are also building significant momentum around redevelopment and real estate value ad as John Burkart has executed strategy and ethic for over 2 decades. My team historically has focused on [Indiscernible] oriented value ad as we frankly didn't have the right experience after somewhat underwhelming experience from our Vintage transaction many years ago. Now with John and Mike Ferry, our Global Head of Development in one team, re-development and real estate value-add will be another avenue for growth going forward. Stay tune for more.  On the relationships side, I cannot be more pleased to announce that we started 2 new development projects with Kisco, the second phase of Cardinal and [Indiscernible]. Kisco is one of our best operators in our portfolio. Occupancy, incredibly bouncing already back to high nineties. I cannot be more proud to be partnering with Andy Kohlberg and his team to find a few more A-plus plus micro-markets while a Cardinal model will be fantastically successful.  We signed a long-term exclusive development contract with Kisco and look forward to grow this partnership over next decade. From the success of these wonderful new addition to the exclusive pipeline agreements quarter-after-quarter, I hope that you, as our Investor, now share the same belief that we truly have built a deep and wide moat around a real estate business through predictive analytics platform that is unique and unprecedented in the real estate industry. With that, I will pass it on to John for a deep dive in operational trends. John.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on the performance of our outpatient medical and seniors housing operating portfolio, starting with our outpatient medical. During the third quarter, our outpatient medical segment delivered 3.1% same-store revenue growth over the prior year's quarter, leading to same-store NOI growth of 3.4%. The increases were driven by increased property level expense recovery and a reduction in bad debt. Occupancy in our same-store portfolio ended the quarter at 94.7%, a 30-basis point reduction from the prior year's quarter. We continue to see record retention rates with the third quarter exceeding 90%.  And with increasing construction costs in rising market rates, we will continue to push renewal rates and accept a reasonable level of increased turnover and related frictional vacancy as we strive to optimize top and bottom-line performance and maximize the value of the portfolio. Now, turning to our Senior Housing Operating portfolio. I'm pleased to report that year-over-year revenue growth in our SHO portfolio turned positive in September, marking the first monthly increase since the onset of COVID-19.  The strong demand-based recovery in seniors housing was led by our U.S. portfolio, which year-over-year revenue turned positive in August, and our UK portfolio, which turned positive in September. The occupancy recovery, an improvement in REVPOR, which began in Q1 reflect a needs-based nature of senior housing and a recognition that these communities are active, safe, and social, 3-key elements to quality senior living. The U.S. continues to lead the recovery, growing occupancy 600 basis points from the trough in mid-March through September 30th, followed by the UK at 540 basis points.  Our Canadian portfolio remains behind the U.S. and UK in the recovery, but posted an occupancy gain of basis points in the third quarter compared to a decline Q2. While the Delta variant has impacted staffing and related costs, it is clearly not slowed the demand driven recovery in occupancy and our operators ability to drive rate growth. Year-over-year, same store NOI for the show portfolio decreased 14.9% as compared to Q3, 2020, driven by 200 basis point decrease in the average occupancy and increased expenses, in part due to the Delta spike and related impact on staffing.  While still down versus last year, same store [Indiscernible] has improved markedly from the decline of 44% in the first quarter, a trend which should continue going forward. The increased labor cost during the quarter were driven by a host of macro factors, which led to temporary labor shortages affecting virtually all industries. The result was increased compensation in the form of wages, overtime, bonuses, and the use of agency labor as our operators have been squarely focused on both meeting the increased demand for their active safe and social communities, and a refusal to compromise on the quality of care. The use of agency labor, which can be 2 to 3 times more expensive than permanent employees was particularly impactful during the quarter as employees who had COVID, were exposed to COVID, or even had a cold had to call in sick, leaving agency staffing as the only option.  As Shankh alluded to, these extraordinary labor expenses are starting to abate. Although I expect we will still see some continued pressure for several months. I'm hearing green shoots as our operators are making comments such as, the peak labor challenge has passed, or we've seen a substantial pickup in applications, our new hires outnumber the employees leaving 2.5 to one, and even we're currently fully staffed at almost all of our communities. Going forward, obviously, I don't know how COVID will impact the economy. But we do know that the operators are increasing their rates substantially to cover the increased labor costs.  Similar to the multi-family business there can be timing issues or delay between expenses hitting the bottom line when the revenue flows through to the bottom line. We're seeing that right now with elevated maintenance expense, which in part relates to preparing units for occupancy due to increasing demand. Additionally, rental rates and care service reimbursements are typically adjusted annually and require 60 to 90 days\u2019 notice, similar to multi-family. Therefore, we continue to move forward -- therefore as we continue to move forward in this demand driven recovery, we expect to see the impact from these rate increases in 2022.  Additionally, despite similar occupancy improvement across all states which grew early from the additionally, despite a similar occupancy improvement across all states, we've seen a divergence in the impact of agency expense between states which would view early from the federal unemployment programs versus those which maintained supplemental benefits through the early September. More specifically, states opting out of these programs early saw roughly 2/3 of the incremental sequential increase in agency expense as compared to those states which maintained supplemental benefits.  Finally, during the last 90 days, I've been fully immersed in the various aspects of Welltower senior housing business, including volunteering at sites, meeting with the leadership of various operators and, of course, [Indiscernible] numerous properties. My experience has been consistent with my expectations in that I have found that, the operators deliver a very high level of care to our residents and provide a top-quality living experience. While the focus on care has been and continues to be very high, I believe that similar to the multifamily industry 20 to 30 years ago, there was an opportunity to modernize our Seniors Housing business and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations.  These efforts will further improve the resident experience, employee engagement, and the financial performance of these communities, including the potential for significant margin expansion. Without giving away my entire playbook, renovating and [Indiscernible] certain communities, implementing revenue management across the portfolio, and engaging in a digital transformation are just a few examples of what I'm thinking about. Being at the beginning of this coming demographic demand wave and seeing a ray of growth and optimization opportunities across all our businesses make this a very exciting time to be at Welltower. Now I will turn the call over to Tim.\nTim Mchugh: Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2021 results, the performance of our Triple-net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a Balance Sheet liquidity update in addition to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.42 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share versus guidance of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios.  As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter in arrears. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30/2021. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the third quarter, have reflected 92% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period across our senior housing triple-net and long-term post-acute portfolios. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI declined 80 basis points year-over-year. As a negative year-over-year impact of leases moving the cash recognition began to dissipate. We expect same-store NOI growth to turn positive next quarter. Trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.83 times.  Looking forward, we expect coverages to bottom next quarter near current coverage levels before starting their recovery in Q1. Over the first 7 months of the recovery, we observed occupancy in EBITDA trends within our senior housing triple-net portfolio that are in line with our U.S. and UK operating portfolios. As these recovery trends have strengthened, the solvency risk of our operators has decreased in tandem, and our continued strong cash rent collection along with the value of the collateral that sits behind many of our lease agreements, continues to provide us confidence that Welltower's real estate position remains strong.  Next, our long-term [Indiscernible] portfolio generated -1% year-over-year same-store growth and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage of 1.25 times. In the quarter, we transitioned to 11 more Genesis assets new operators, bringing total year-to-date Genesis transitions to 48 properties. We also completed the disposition of 21 of these transition assets, bringing total year-to-date dispositions to 30 former Genesis assets, including our 9 Power back assets sold in the ProMedica joint venture in the second quarter. With another 14 scheduled for disposition in the coming months. Long-term post-acute in-place NOI concentration is now 5.4% of total portfolio in place NOI.  And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica senior care joint venture with a ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI with a positive 2.8% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.24 times. The drop in splinter coverage was driven largely by the timing of HHS stimulus. As the majority of HHS revenue received ProMedica was received in 2Q20, and this was not repeated in 2Q21. At HHS funds 2Q '21 EBITDA was up relative to 2Q '20. As revenue grew both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.  Our June trailing 12-month coverage also includes results of the previously announced sale of 25-assets held by the joint venture, 21 of which have already been sold to date with the remaining 4 expected to be completed in the coming months. These assets had contributed more than $30 million in negative EBITDA for the trailing 12-months period, ending 6/30/2021. And that their disposal alone will create considerable coverage accretion on a go-forward basis.  I'd also like to remind everyone that our lease is fully backed by a senior claim and the substantial real estate value held at the joint venture, and also the full corporate guarantee, the ProMedica Health System. Turning to capital market activity, we continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the Company to efficiently capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions.  Since the beginning of the third quarter, we sold 11.5 million shares via forward sale agreement, an initial weighted average price of approximately $84.36 per share for expected gross proceeds of $966 million. Since the beginning of the year, we have sold a total of 29.5 million shares of common stock via forward sale agreements, which are expected to generate total proceeds of $2.4 billion of which 12.7 million shares were settled during the third quarter, resulting in $1 billion of gross proceeds. At the end of the third -- of the quarter, we had approximately 11.8 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $1 billion.  When in the second quarter at 6.97 times net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, up slightly from an HHS adjusted 6.88 times at the end of the last quarter. The uptick in leverage was apprised of $1.7 billion of net investment activity completed the quarter. If we run rate the impact of the investment activity completed in the quarter, pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA decreased to 6.82 times. As a reminder, we ended the quarter of approximately $1 million once sell equity raised on a forward basis, along with $f309 million expected disposition proceeds in loan payoffs.  Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity profile, coupled with a recovery underway in our senior housing sector, have been recognized by S&P and Moody's with both rating agencies recently rating our credit outlook to stable. The upgrades validate the prudent measures Welltower's taken to mitigate risk through the pandemic and to appropriately capitalize our recent investment activity. On a forward-looking basis, as both Shankh and John noted, we continue to be pleased with the momentum of the recovery of the senior housing operating portfolio.  With portfolio occupancy ending the quarter at 76.7%, 210 basis points higher than at the end of the prior quarter, but still over 1,000 basis points below pre -COVID levels. The portfolio also sets 1,400 basis points below peak occupancy levels achieved prior to last decade supply wave, setting stage for a powerful EBITDA recovery. As occupancy upside and strong rate growth is coupled with significant margin expansion of a very depressed base.  Lastly, moving to our fourth quarter outlook. Last night, we provide d an outlook for the fourth quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.20 to $0.25, and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. This guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS or similar government programs in the UK and Canada. So, in comparing it sequentially to our third quarter normalized FFO per share, it be better to use an as-adjusted $0.79 per share for 3Q, which excludes $5 million in out-of-period [Indiscernible] and benefits that we received in the quarter.  On this comparison, the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, C/8.5 represents a C/1.5 sequential increase from 3Q. This C/1.5 increase is composed of C/3.5 over accretion from strong investment activity in the third quarter and a sequential increase in Seniors Housing Operating Portfolio, NOI, driven by an expected 140 basis points increase in sequential average occupancy. Offset by $0.02 of dilution from increase sequential G&A, an increased share count from share settled in the third quarter. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. I want to make 3 quick points before Q&A. First, despite our historic amount at capital deployment over the last few months, I'm very optimistic about the momentum into the year-end and next year. A recent prominent trend that we're starting to see that deals are bouncing back to us as buyers from buyers who need property-level financing as debt market has become very skittish after recent disruption from Delta and labor challenges while working on C3 such transaction right now. Second, with a significant rise of labor and other costs, operators are left with two choices if they were to survive as a business. Either to cut services at our corners or to increase prices.  We believe families understand from looking at prices of virtually all goods and services, from fast food to apartment rents, that there is an unprecedented upward pressure in cost. After speaking with vast majority of our operators, I can assure you that Welltower operating partners do not plan to diminish the level of services and care provided to our residents. So, for the industry in general, recent increase in expense, it would be difficult to continue to provide quality services without an appropriate balance in revenue. As such, rent levels will need to be increased.  The industry should not cut corners, and it should never lose focus on the quality of their services. Please remember the simple mantra that there is no mission without margin. Third, our frenzied pace of new hiring continues through the summer and fall for both early career as well as experienced professionals. In fact, we have added 125 new colleagues since the beginning of COVID, representing a 25% increase in our overall headcount. We're rounding up on our campus recruitment programs as we speak and are delighted that this year class will be the biggest in the history of the Company. With that operator, please open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And as a reminder, to answer questions, you will need to press [Operator Instructions]. To withdraw a question, please press [Operator Instructions] We will be limiting questions to 1 question at a time. You will be muted as soon as you asks your question [Operator Instructions]. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nSteve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. Shankh, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the occupancy trend that you're expecting into the fourth quarter. I realize that things are maybe seasonally slowing down as we move into the holidays, but I'm just wondering if the trends you've seen in October, into early part of November, what are sort of the risks that you see to hitting the guidance that you've put out there?\nShankh Mitra : Steve, that's a really good question. Let's talk about -- if you look at the history, you will see sequentially from Q3 to Q4, we usually have 20 to 40 basis points of average occupancy growth. We guided 440. So, if occupancy is obviously up meaningfully from that number, we gave you, what we are trying to give you is get away from this monthly, weekly numbers. We've got to run a long-term Company. But we can tell you, if the occupancy stays flat from here to the end of the quarter, we'll still hit our number.  Now let's talk about the fundamentals, not about guidance. We have -- we are seeing unprecedented level of demand and sales environment that we have never seen even this late into the year. If you look at how our October sales trends have ended and then how November has started, this is truly unprecedented. Now are we -- how are we going to protect that through the holiday season. We're just not in the business of doing that. We're running a long-term business, but I can tell you the momentum that we feel in the sales trend, which obviously translate into -- October sales trends translate into November and December occupancy. We have never seen this kind of momentum. That's all I'm willing to say.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer of Baird. Your line is open.\nAmanda Sweitzer : Thanks. Good morning. Can you help frame up how you're thinking about the potential magnitude of sharp price increases next year a bit more, either in terms of current implied loss to lease in the portfolio, or the pricing pre -owned that you expect the portfolio to achieve relative to the industry?\nShankh Mitra : Amanda, we created a new slide in our slide deck. If you look at it, the inflation versus what we think our historic rate growth has been. Now remember that senior housing is not an income -driven sector, it's an asset -driven sector. Housing is obviously the primary 1, but the other things others too. That should frame what is possible from you. I will also tell you, just if you go back and read my prepared remarks, we talked about how there needs to be a price increase to offset labor increase. And you saw that that will also give you some bookends of what is possible.  Clearly, we know what the numbers are, because obviously you got to send letters 45, 60 days before, so we know what is being sent out. and the early feedback from some of our operators who have sustained obviously this entirely. And remember, we also have roles going through. Well, not the entire portfolio is [Indiscernible], so we have some early indications of as we have seen the spike of expenses and we have -- our operating partners have adjusted their pricing, how is that update, that what is behind my comment that I am very optimistic about pricing next year. But it is too early to comment. We'll talk about it in the February call. But I cannot emphasize it enough that we are very optimistic about the pricing increases. And frankly, the industry as a whole we need to do that if we need to make more revenue than expenses in this business.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of John Pelusi of Green Street. Your line is open.\nJohn Pelusi : Thanks. Maybe just one follow-up to that conversation there. Could you share what rent increases you're currently sending out today?\nShankh Mitra : John, you're putting me in a pretty tough spot. I don't want to put a number out there, but I'm trying to avoid that. But if you look at the inflation versus rent chart that we provided, we intentionally provided that. If I were you, I would look at that. And then I would look at what that pricing power comes from, which is the housing and other asset rates and how people fund this expense. And you will get to a number, but I will tell you the industry overall, I just came back from the [Indiscernible] Conference. Industry is talking about substantial rate increases, not mediocre rating business.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph of Citi. Your line is open.\nNick Joseph : Best operators will rise, just on expense, labor pressures. Are you saying that it across all of the operators? Is it across all geographies or are there any differences that you're seeing either from strategy or from location or any other factor?\nShankh Mitra : We have seen it across the board, but of different magnitude. As I mentioned the new operator that we brought in in Q3, the $172 million transaction to use zero agency [Indiscernible] And we have seen some operators where contract labor costs has gone up 10x in 6 months. I want to repeat Nick, 10x in 6 months, right? So obviously, you have seen a very different experience depending on who the operator is, but I will tell you also, all these management teams are very focused on bringing that number down significantly.  Our guidance, as Tim suggested, does not contemplate that you will see a step down in Q4, but we are already starting to hear -- as Jon said, we're already starting to hear that step down is taking place even in October going through November of the year. But we don't know what is going to happen in the holiday season. So, we're not going to sit here and speculate, right? Our goal is not to speculate on what's going to be a one-quarter number but go back to my comment, what I said, that stabilized margin of this portfolio -- I can talk about the industry. It is my firm belief that our margin will be higher than the pre-COVID margin on a stabilized basis.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nMike Mueller : Yeah. Hi. I was just curious, what's fourth-quarter guidance assumed for show labor cost trends? Any improvement whatsoever or just kind of a continuation of increased but on a full-quarter impact?\nShankh Mitra : Mike, as I mentioned in the previous caution that Tim assumed that it will not improve. That's what's in the numbers of that we provided you. However, as I mentioned, that we are already starting to see improvement. The wild card here is how things play out in during the holiday season. We just don't know.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria : Good morning. Just hoping you could talk to pricing for new customers in the market today. I recognize the intention is for the industry and for Welltower operators to push come [Indiscernible] 1 or on the 12-month anniversary. But curious how pricing trends are faring for new customers across the industry or across your portfolio.\nShankh Mitra : Juan, exceptionally good question. It's actually my favorite topic. I like this topic more than even the rent increases. It is -- it's just I'm not going to mention any specific numbers. I will say -- let's just say that we're talking about X percent increase on average for the whole portfolio. From my operating partners, I'm hearing, the street level increase in the rate is between 1.5x to 2x. The Street is moving up faster than the renewal.  That's what I'm hearing from my operating partners. But we'll see how that plays out. This is a very interesting cycle that we're seeing. There has never been more focused on quality and safety. In previous cycles, if you have competed on, whether you are a new shiny penny on the corner or not, the cycle customers are focused on -- they've always focused on debt, but this cycle they're primarily focused on quality of services, quality of care, and the reputation of operators. They are not competing on price.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDerek Johnston : Hi, good morning. The $5.6 billion of investments over the past year really stands out, how much of this would you consider opportunistic driven by the pandemic, versus perhaps in a normal Welltower growth that would have happened anyway? And is this level of investment repeatable going forward? How much more capacity do you have to get through the investment process and take advantage of this market?\nShankh Mitra : So, Derek, I do not give guidance on how much transaction one to do. We're not a volume-driven investor, we're value-driven investor, that's the first point. The $5.6 billion significantly understate what that investment volume is. Just to give you a simple example, that -- what the transaction that we have closed represent the $5.6 billion that you mentioned, 25,000 units. Let's just think about it what that means. 25,000 units we have done had a $172,000 value unit pricing. In a normal environment, that would have been $10, $11, $12 billion of transaction. That's -- we got to put that into perspective.  Second, the industry remains very fragmented, and there is a lot of churn going on in ownership as people are finding it either this is -- if you are in 3 different businesses and you don't want to be in this business anymore, we're seeing as data from a lot of families. The labor pressured, obviously COVID was hard enough. Now the labor pressure challenge rising from this. And last few months, we have seen those repeat transaction that we had conversation a month ago. You recall I mentioned that when we are not getting to the finish line on a transaction, that's not because that's going to somewhere else. It really means that they're not selling.  At that price, they're not selling. And now we're seeing a lot of people are giving -- really giving up. Now remember, they can give up because we bring an operator to the table. You will not sell your real estate and continue to run it. The reason you are selling real estate that you don't want to run it. So, putting all this together, as I said in my prepared remarks, despite a significant acquisition volume, I remain very optimistic that this trend of acquisition at these kind of prices will continue finally -- frankly longer than I thought.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nTayo Okusanya : Good morning, everyone. In your recent business update, as an interesting slide here, that shows your shop portfolio on the power of diversity. I'm just kind of curious. Shankh earlier on mentioned ultimately you expect the winners and losers and the senior housing space over the next few years. So that suggest that we start to see a little bit more concentration going forward across Acuity geography on operating model based on who you believe winners will be? Or should we still expect to see real diversification across Acuity and monthly rents with the idea being you just pick the best players at each point on this graph?\nShankh Mitra : Thank you. Tayo, welcome back.\nTayo Okusanya : Thank you.\nShankh Mitra : First, you pick ed the right slide to talk about. We do believe that diversification will continue, but there is going to be significant consolidation in the industry. Let me give you an example. A pretty good example to talk about. One of our best operating partner is operating partner in Midwest, named StoryPoint. You've heard several times about how highly I think of this team. Before pandemic, we've got an [Indiscernible] offer at an incredible price.  So, we sold the 13 buildings we had with StoryPoint and kept 2 new developments that recently -- at that point, opened. So, a big partner we went from 13 to 2. That was 2 years ago. Today, with all the transactions that we have done and all the transaction that is in pipeline, in that 2 years, frankly, through the pandemic in the last 18 months, we are back to 50-plus communities with StoryPoint. That tells you how the winners and losers are changing in the business. The market share of great operators is changing, right? I'll give you another example. Look at how many assets Oakmont managed.  It\u2019s a great example of a fantastic operator. Look at how many assets Oakmont managed 12 months ago, 18 months ago. And make it note on your calendar to see how Oakmont become -- has become a dominant player in California today, 12 months from now, 24 months from now. Right? This is just an example I'm trying to give you. So, you will see that shift of winners and losers, you have seen some spectacular failure of senior housing operators in the business and I can tell you those are not the only ones that you know of\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRich Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. Hey Shankh, you had a really interesting sliding deck about historical affect the revenue relative to inflation. And as I listen to you talk and listen to you saying that this is a different cycle in past, it does strike me that that maybe the outperformance versus inflation could be even higher this time. Could you maybe talk about that over the medium to long term and how you think about that?\nShankh Mitra : Absolutely. First, welcome to our call. We're glad to hear from you. If you think about inflation, inflation and -- most people thinking about inflation is a matter of how much not just obviously the supply side, but also the demand side and the people's ability to pay. Generally speaking, inflation is an Income concept, which obviously, as we all know, that's for most types of products and services. Senior housing is different. Senior housing is not an income-driven sector. It's an asset -driven sector. Look at that asset inflation of what happened.  Obviously, we tried to put together some slides to give you some sense of what happened to the people who are funding the residences, these expense. And you will see that asset inflation has never been more significant, aka the affordability of the product has never been better. So, I think you are onto something. As I've tried to say without putting a number, putting those 2 slides should give you a context of how much rent increases is possible, not just near-term, but over a long period of time. And frankly speaking, as I said, if you think about, we have a Bargel strategy in our portfolio.  If you go back and look at the Q4 of 19 call, This is the last call before COVID that I talked about in detail of how this barbell strategy work, where you have a high touch, high service product in the coast, our coastal type market, where you can -- where labor costs can be fully recovered and still in margin to be made. On the other hand, other side of the barbell are one that's housing portfolio, there's no labor. We have gone to that, and that diversification, we have been very, very focused and very intentional. So, between the 2, you will see a very significant inflation plus growth that's coming. That will be funded obviously to the asset inflation that already has happened.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Carroll : Yes, thanks. I want to go back to the street rates answer that you provided earlier. I guess what's the reasoning that the seniors housing street rate growth is increasing at a faster clip than the renewal growth? Are street rates slower right now than those existing rates and it's just that gap's closing or is there something different there that I'm not thinking about?\nShankh Mitra : So, Mike, if you have to think about total rate versus real estate rates, because usually a portion comes in at a say, X level of care and then that goes up to say X plus 2 level of care. So, you've got to have to obviously think about when you say street trade versus in-place trend, do you mean just the total rate or the real estate rate? The real estate rate, if you just call it the relative component of the rent is not -- the street rates are lower. It is just that the operators are realizing that they're not competing just on price.  They e have a quality product, and that quality product people know -- I don't hear from my operating partners people are coming that I want to stay down the lane for $500 less my operating partners, so you should go ahead and do that. We're not going to -- there's a cost to provide the services, the first-class services that we provide. That's just not going to happen that you will cut it. You're not going to stay at Wisconsin for Hilton Garden's price. Nothing wrong with any of those models but that's just not the model. Right?  So, the street rate are going up because you have demand. Look at the take, what we are seeing even this kind of late into the year when you should have -- seasonally, we should have come off and we haven't. So as operators gain momentum on the sales side, they're realizing that our special product, there's a cost, obviously, of serving that piece of occupancy. And we have to charge for it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJordan Sadler : Thanks. Good morning. Shankh, I wanted to just talk about some of the new things we saw this quarter, heard on the call and a couple of things that popped out to me, where in the CCRCs that you purchased during the quarter, and then separately when I heard you talking about John, you mentioned the ability to do redevelopment and real estate value-add opportunities. So, could you expand on these 2 pieces? 1. Just the interest level in the -- our increased interest level in the entrance fee communities and the return profile for those types of assets? And then maybe what specifically, or maybe even generically, you're thinking in terms of redevelopment or value add dollars or opportunities.\nShankh Mitra : Very good question, Jordan. And thank you for getting 2 questions through that first time on the line. So, I'll answer both, and I hope I can remember it. Let's just try first. It's not an increased level of interest in the CCRC communities, we are value-driven real-estate investors, we saw a tremendous opportunity because of the [Indiscernible]. So, if I'd give you some details, we bought that portfolio for $195,000 a unit, and in -- with remarkable dark. So, talk about Westchester, New York, Dana Point, California, Bellevue, Washington, Alexandria. That level, that kind of dark. And then we thought what we can do with the dark. Then I mentioned obviously there is an example of the asset came with a piece of parcel that is the last residential zoned piece of land in residentially Bellevue.  When we look at a lot of CCRC, we continue to -- we always have we continue to look at, it's just we never seen this opportunity where we can do more than what we buy, not just leasing up obviously what we've done, but also a lot more what that can be done with the dot -- with the client entitlement. That's why we're interested in. As I mentioned, I will give you details of what I think that it can go from a high-single-digit and unlevered IRR to a low double-digit unlevered IRR as we execute on this. And frankly, we bought it.  That's where most of our returns have been focused on. We continue to get, call it between 9% to 12%, 13% on levered IRR, mostly transaction we have done, and the return life right there. Focused on the real estate value-add, one of the big real estate value-add that this Company tried to do is Vintage. As you are well aware of the fact that hasn't played out well for us. As I went through the experience, I realized that we didn't have the right talent. It's much more difficult to do it than obviously we taught.  And we stopped that whole focus on real estate value ad in a traditional sense of the real estate. As you know, John has done this for billions of dollars of transactions and executed based on that strategy. So, when we're talking to John, going back a few months ago, that's something that came up and now, obviously, John is the marched into that portfolio, and he is obviously one of the most important member of our investment committee.  So those opportunities we're now ready to really expand on and really execute on. It also as to what I mentioned, that we have built an extraordinary development team over the last 18 months under the leadership of Mike Ferry. We brought in Mike over a year ago and he has built a very large team. And so those are all thoughts that are all coming together. But it's a skill set we didn't have, and now, we do have it.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of SMBC. Your line is open.\nRich Anderson : I'm going after John Burkart here. So, John, welcome to the call.\nJohn Burkart : Thank you.\nRich Anderson : The comments you made about some of the things that you want to apply to the business from your experience in multi-family, I just wanted to touch on a couple. I know you're not going to give away the secret sauce now, but revenue management and some of the multi-family tech initiatives that have been the name of the game in that business for a while now. isn't revenue management only as good as it's fully kind of used in the industry.  So, if you're using revenue management and no one else is, it's sort of not useless, but certainly not as effective. So how do you get the word out on using revenue management? How much is it being used in the industry? And then also in the tech initiatives, how much is that out there already -- There, I think you can make a real difference relative to your peers. I just wanted to see if I can get some color from you on those 2 topics. Thanks.\nJohn Burkart : Certainly. And it's Chalk would tell you got two questions is.\nRich Anderson : Of course.\nJohn Burkart : On the revenue management, actually, I don't agree with you. I think it is operator related and it has really nothing to do with what the industry as a whole. It's an individual, how you price the units, but more than that and more than even the software, And this gets into really one of the wonderful things here is leveraging our data analytics platform, because what you have to do is you have to price the units right on the amenity pricing -- the base pricing, which is not just about changing the price over time, it's about pricing the base price correctly, the relationships between 1's and 2's, the values of certain units -- those with views, those without, etc.  And looking at a portfolio, you just can't possibly do that 1 person, 10 people, 20 people, and get it right. But let leveraging the data analytics platform and go back in time and look at how the market has priced it. That's a different, that's a game changer. And that's what we're working on right now is, I'm partnered up with our data analytics platform to go back and look at our units, look, and understand how the market's price.  That I can tell you in one particular case, we looked and saw on a high-rise substantial variations in demand versus pricing. We're talking in some cases, a $1,000 a unit. Really dramatic change in how we're going to price that product based upon what the market has told us. We'll take that and then we'll add on top of that some other software that will ultimately create to price the unit. Super excited about that.  And the second question was -- this technology was your second question, tremendous opportunities. No question about it. I won't go into the details here. I don't want to give that away. But yes, there are tremendous opportunities to really improve the customer experience, but also to reduce the labor. And of course, that's a big component by just applying existing technology into the business that hasn't been used in the past. So very excited about that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico : Thanks. I just wanted to go back to the expense topic and how to think about labor because it was up 4% year-over-year in the third quarter, the occupancy was down a bit. So maybe that's an unusual relationship, but just trying to understand how we should think about labor expenses going forward because it doesn't seem like that is the pressure that's going to abate anytime soon. I mean, you talked about agency labor.  Maybe, I'm a little bit confused why that use of agency labor would be reduced going forward if it's still a challenging time to be hiring people. And maybe you can just go to triangulate how you guys are thinking about labor when you talk about Shankh, your comment that shop margin will be higher than that of pre-COVID. Eventually, you give IRR calculations, which assumed something presumably about margin, labor, expenses. Maybe you can just give us a feel for how you guys are really underwriting labor as an expense going forward.\nShankh Mitra : Fantastic. I would highly recommend you go back and read the script, and you will see that we have detailed that out in our prepared remarks as well as in the other -- answering other questions. But I'll try to summarize it. First, you have to understand the confluence of factors having. Just purely focused on the labor side in the quarter. You people didn't travel for 18 months. And then that's the first time you've got a lot of PTOs being taken and that what caused a very significant demand because our operators provide PTOs, right? So, you've got a significant surge of that.  That's sort of understands our one aspect of what happens, 2), you got one extra day in the quarter. You get paid by obviously daily basis, but you get revenue in most cases on a monthly basis, that's second point. Third, you have to understand that when -- because of the rise of COVID, people are extra cautious. There's a reason there is no COVID in the communities. You've got sniffles and you called in and you should have called in.  But at that last moment look at the spike of the COVID through the quarter, majority of the we got obviously problems in July, but then we got a massive spike as you followed the COVID curve through August and September. We're on the other side of that, right? That's why if you put all of this together then obviously follow the opt-in state versus opt-out state comment that John made.  You'll understand it's not a question of optimism, we're actually seeing it. That we're on the other end of it. But only time will say, obviously how that exactly plays out, how much time that takes. But if you follow all these comments that we made, you can put together that picture pretty clearly. Nice, I would just add, if you look that compensation was Basis points year-over-year. So, to your point, occupancy a bit down still seeing compensation cost up, there is real base wage inflation. But the driver of that 4.1% year-over-year expense growth, the lion's share of it is being driven by agency.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time and that does conclude our conference call. You may now disconnect.\nShankh Mitra : Thank you.",

            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on the performance of our outpatient medical and seniors housing operating portfolio, starting with our outpatient medical. During the third quarter, our outpatient medical segment delivered 3.1% same-store revenue growth over the prior year's quarter, leading to same-store NOI growth of 3.4%. The increases were driven by increased property level expense recovery and a reduction in bad debt. Occupancy in our same-store portfolio ended the quarter at 94.7%, a 30-basis point reduction from the prior year's quarter. We continue to see record retention rates with the third quarter exceeding 90%.  And with increasing construction costs in rising market rates, we will continue to push renewal rates and accept a reasonable level of increased turnover and related frictional vacancy as we strive to optimize top and bottom-line performance and maximize the value of the portfolio. Now, turning to our Senior Housing Operating portfolio. I'm pleased to report that year-over-year revenue growth in our SHO portfolio turned positive in September, marking the first monthly increase since the onset of COVID-19.  The strong demand-based recovery in seniors housing was led by our U.S. portfolio, which year-over-year revenue turned positive in August, and our UK portfolio, which turned positive in September. The occupancy recovery, an improvement in REVPOR, which began in Q1 reflect a needs-based nature of senior housing and a recognition that these communities are active, safe, and social, 3-key elements to quality senior living. The U.S. continues to lead the recovery, growing occupancy 600 basis points from the trough in mid-March through September 30th, followed by the UK at 540 basis points.  Our Canadian portfolio remains behind the U.S. and UK in the recovery, but posted an occupancy gain of basis points in the third quarter compared to a decline Q2. While the Delta variant has impacted staffing and related costs, it is clearly not slowed the demand driven recovery in occupancy and our operators ability to drive rate growth. Year-over-year, same store NOI for the show portfolio decreased 14.9% as compared to Q3, 2020, driven by 200 basis point decrease in the average occupancy and increased expenses, in part due to the Delta spike and related impact on staffing.  While still down versus last year, same store [Indiscernible] has improved markedly from the decline of 44% in the first quarter, a trend which should continue going forward. The increased labor cost during the quarter were driven by a host of macro factors, which led to temporary labor shortages affecting virtually all industries. The result was increased compensation in the form of wages, overtime, bonuses, and the use of agency labor as our operators have been squarely focused on both meeting the increased demand for their active safe and social communities, and a refusal to compromise on the quality of care. The use of agency labor, which can be 2 to 3 times more expensive than permanent employees was particularly impactful during the quarter as employees who had COVID, were exposed to COVID, or even had a cold had to call in sick, leaving agency staffing as the only option.  As Shankh alluded to, these extraordinary labor expenses are starting to abate. Although I expect we will still see some continued pressure for several months. I'm hearing green shoots as our operators are making comments such as, the peak labor challenge has passed, or we've seen a substantial pickup in applications, our new hires outnumber the employees leaving 2.5 to one, and even we're currently fully staffed at almost all of our communities. Going forward, obviously, I don't know how COVID will impact the economy. But we do know that the operators are increasing their rates substantially to cover the increased labor costs.  Similar to the multi-family business there can be timing issues or delay between expenses hitting the bottom line when the revenue flows through to the bottom line. We're seeing that right now with elevated maintenance expense, which in part relates to preparing units for occupancy due to increasing demand. Additionally, rental rates and care service reimbursements are typically adjusted annually and require 60 to 90 days' notice, similar to multi-family. Therefore, we continue to move forward -- therefore as we continue to move forward in this demand driven recovery, we expect to see the impact from these rate increases in 2022.  Additionally, despite similar occupancy improvement across all states which grew early from the additionally, despite a similar occupancy improvement across all states, we've seen a divergence in the impact of agency expense between states which would view early from the federal unemployment programs versus those which maintained supplemental benefits through the early September. More specifically, states opting out of these programs early saw roughly 2/3 of the incremental sequential increase in agency expense as compared to those states which maintained supplemental benefits.  Finally, during the last 90 days, I've been fully immersed in the various aspects of Welltower senior housing business, including volunteering at sites, meeting with the leadership of various operators and, of course, [Indiscernible] numerous properties. My experience has been consistent with my expectations in that I have found that, the operators deliver a very high level of care to our residents and provide a top-quality living experience. While the focus on care has been and continues to be very high, I believe that similar to the multifamily industry 20 to 30 years ago, there was an opportunity to modernize our Seniors Housing business and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations.  These efforts will further improve the resident experience, employee engagement, and the financial performance of these communities, including the potential for significant margin expansion. Without giving away my entire playbook, renovating and [Indiscernible] certain communities, implementing revenue management across the portfolio, and engaging in a digital transformation are just a few examples of what I'm thinking about. Being at the beginning of this coming demographic demand wave and seeing a ray of growth and optimization opportunities across all our businesses make this a very exciting time to be at Welltower. Now I will turn the call over to Tim. Thank you. Certainly. And it's Chalk would tell you got two questions is. On the revenue management, actually, I don't agree with you. I think it is operator related and it has really nothing to do with what the industry as a whole.

            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. I'll walk you through our high-level business trends and capital allocation priorities. John Burkart, our COO, will walk you through the details, operating environment in SHO and MOB. Tim will walk you through the triple-net businesses, earnings guidance and capitalization. This is Jon's first call as he's beginning to dig into the business. So please go easy on him. Despite mediocre bottom-line results, we cannot be happier with the overall results of the quarter. Just 6 months ago, many industry participants and observers were cautioning if the COVID pandemic would result in apartment impairment of demand for senior housing.  And even most people who believe that the demand would come back were worried that with every surge of the virus, the business would take a significant step back. As it has been our experience that these surges drive revenue down, cost up, resulting in a significant hit to the bottom line. For the first time since the beginning of pandemic, we [Indiscernible] this trend. And despite witnessing a significant surge of the Delta variant after we spoke 3 months ago, we still posted the strongest sequential revenue growth in the Company's history.  Occupancy went up 210 basis points in the quarter relative to our guidance of 190 basis points pre-Delta, and rate growth accelerated resulting in a 3.5% sequential increase in topline revenue across our same-store shop portfolio. Importantly, year-over-year revenue growth inflected positively in the U.S. and UK portfolio for the first time since the beginning of pandemic. This trend accelerated into September when we absorbed a year-over-year revenue increase for the entire portfolio led by U.S. and UK, which reported a year-over-year revenue growth over 2%.  This is particularly impressive in context of a massive Delta surge. Let's reflect on why that might be the case. With nearly all resident vaccinated and stuff vaccination rates approaching 90%, which is substantially higher than general population, prospective residents and their families recognized that our communities are much safer environment than alternative settings. You can see that in our data. In the U.S., despite a tenfold increase in the daily case counts across U.S. in July and August, the number of cases within our short portfolio was just 10% of peak levels observed during the prior surges.  It's similar trend was experienced across our Canadian and UK portfolio for the -- over the same time. This helped us build significant topline momentum in our business as we received the dual benefit of occupancy and rate growth, which we believe will continue into next year. In fact, I believe this trend will meaningfully accelerate into next year as we feel significant momentum in the rate environment. Despite this great top-line performance, our bottom-line performance was mediocre and impacted by a perfect storm across the expense stack.  We had a confluence of extraordinary costs, including agency labor as COVID surged, heightened R&M, insurance costs, utility costs, and other sundry costs, all hitting at the same time. There's also an extra day in the quarter which resulted in a mismatch of revenue and expenses as majority of our operators charge rent on a monthly basis. Additionally, we saw meaningful rise in paid time off as many of the employees took advantage of the easing travel restriction during the summer. The rise of COVID also resulted additional call-off from our team members at the last minute, which drove a significant spike in the use of agency lever, which costs 2X to 3X. This situation was further complicated by the vaccination mandate which the system is currently working through.  The only good deals on the expense overall is that we began to see the situation normalized in October. While it is too early to comment on exactly how long it will take for the situation to fully normalize, we need to unpack what logically will stay with us in the medium to long term and what will dissipate. In our opinion, based way to increases are sticky and they will likely to be here as unit cost of labor. We firmly believe Welltower operating partners will be able to overcome this hurdle through rent increases as they offer a premium product within a premium micro-market. The alternative of one-on-one care just got significantly more expensive.  We are beginning to see the green shoot emerge as operating partners have been -- have seen expansion of labor pool with supplemental unemployment benefits rolling off and children having gone back to school. John will provide more details on this topic. But we believe the usage of agency lever will dissipate going forward. Our guidance for Q4 will suggest that we do not expect this situation to completely reverse primarily because of 3 factors. 1. We have a mismatch of revenue growth and expense growth, as a significant portion of our annual increases happen on [Indiscernible] 1. 2. After you hire people, it takes an extended period of time to go through pre -employment and training process before new employees can hit the floor.  And 3. Delta wave, which peaked in late September, is still with us even in November. However, none of these has changed my view that Welltower stabilized shop margin post-COVID will be higher than that of pre -COVID margin. Even on a near-term basis, I do not believe the earnings power of this portfolio, 2022 exit run rate or 2023 run rate, has changed. I want to repeat that one more time. Even on near-term basis, I don't believe the earnings power of this portfolio's 2022 exit run rate or 2023 run rate has changed. The best operators will rise from these difficult times stronger with significant higher market share while many others will find this business too hard to figure out.  We're engaged in, frankly, starkly different conversation with the management team of operators in this industry more broadly. While everyone is fatigued from the events of the past 18 months, many of our partners are watching with John to rethink how technology, operational excellence, revenue optimization, and data analytics can fundamentally change this business. Think of some very basic question, unit labor is going up, but how many units do we need? Price needs to go up, but how do you differentiate price on units with a view of Central Park versus a brick wall. Many operators within the industry are hoping things will get better on their own. Unfortunately, hope is not a great strategy.  Our intense operational focus translates directly into our capital allocation strategy. Let me restate what that is. We want to own the right assets in the right micro market with the right operator focused on right equity and price point. And we want to own that asset at the right basis. Either we'll buy at a discount to replacement cost, or we'll build at extremely targeted way at replacement costs. While bidding [Indiscernible] are pretty thin, primarily with few first-time or relatively new capital, we remain extraordinarily active in off-market, privately negotiated transactions while we bring unmatched [Indiscernible] to close with operator and cash capital.  As most of this situation are debt maturity driven, nothing is more important to the seller than the certainty of close with a firm handshake. And as you know, our reputation is we don't negotiate, and we don't re-trade after we have a firm handshake. This approach has resulted in one of the most active quarter in the history of our Company. We closed $2 billion of investments at a significant discount to replacement costs with expected IRS in the high single-digit to low double-digit.  We continued our momentum subsequent to the end of third quarter with another $1.3 billion transaction that we have signed the purchase and sale agreement, and that we have described in our press release. While they're all very important transaction, let me highlights the different flavors of the deal. We are excited about a $580 million transaction to buy 8 rental and 6 entrance fee communities in great micro markets. We would recall that we bought a handful of Sunrise CCRC from SNH in 2018. This transaction is very similar in asset quality and location standpoint but at a materially better price.  And the previous owner has spent significant amount of capital over $50 million in the last 5 years. We should be able to achieve a high single-digit on levered IRR as our operating partner Watermark leases of the communities. However, we think we can post this return into double-digit on level IRR category as we execute a higher and better use strategy similar to what we have when we're embarking on our 85 Atria portfolio -- 85 property Atria portfolio. For example, there is an extraordinary piece of land in a highly desirable residential Corridor of Bellevue, Washington that is entitled for high density residential as of right.  We can build a great vertical campus of senior or wellness living there, or sell it to a multi-family developer. For many of these communities that access land, while we intend to build additional cottage size units which are already sold out in this location, you get the flavor. In a separate transaction, we bought five classes senior housing communities in Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic region with an extraordinary partner with an extraordinary operator and development group for a $172 million. The average age of these communities is 3 years. And we expect to generate a high single-digit on levered IRR. We also negotiated a long-term exclusive development contract with this team.  I cannot wait to disclose the details of this group and our growth plan with them on the next call. But here is a teaser. This team has executed flawlessly even during this challenging Q3 without any agency lever. That gives you a sense of their operating prowess. In a similar vein to new building, we bought 3 brand new communities in the Midwest from a multi-family developer with new perspective, our existing operator. On average, these building are 2 years old. We feel our future pipeline is robust as we are on a 2-year line with several other granular transactions.  We are also building significant momentum around redevelopment and real estate value ad as John Burkart has executed strategy and ethic for over 2 decades. My team historically has focused on [Indiscernible] oriented value ad as we frankly didn't have the right experience after somewhat underwhelming experience from our Vintage transaction many years ago. Now with John and Mike Ferry, our Global Head of Development in one team, re-development and real estate value-add will be another avenue for growth going forward. Stay tune for more.  On the relationships side, I cannot be more pleased to announce that we started 2 new development projects with Kisco, the second phase of Cardinal and [Indiscernible]. Kisco is one of our best operators in our portfolio. Occupancy, incredibly bouncing already back to high nineties. I cannot be more proud to be partnering with Andy Kohlberg and his team to find a few more A-plus plus micro-markets while a Cardinal model will be fantastically successful.  We signed a long-term exclusive development contract with Kisco and look forward to grow this partnership over next decade. From the success of these wonderful new addition to the exclusive pipeline agreements quarter-after-quarter, I hope that you, as our Investor, now share the same belief that we truly have built a deep and wide moat around a real estate business through predictive analytics platform that is unique and unprecedented in the real estate industry. With that, I will pass it on to John for a deep dive in operational trends. John. Thank you, Tim. I want to make 3 quick points before Q&A. First, despite our historic amount at capital deployment over the last few months, I'm very optimistic about the momentum into the year-end and next year. A recent prominent trend that we're starting to see that deals are bouncing back to us as buyers from buyers who need property-level financing as debt market has become very skittish after recent disruption from Delta and labor challenges while working on C3 such transaction right now. Second, with a significant rise of labor and other costs, operators are left with two choices if they were to survive as a business. Either to cut services at our corners or to increase prices.  We believe families understand from looking at prices of virtually all goods and services, from fast food to apartment rents, that there is an unprecedented upward pressure in cost. After speaking with vast majority of our operators, I can assure you that Welltower operating partners do not plan to diminish the level of services and care provided to our residents. So, for the industry in general, recent increase in expense, it would be difficult to continue to provide quality services without an appropriate balance in revenue. As such, rent levels will need to be increased.  The industry should not cut corners, and it should never lose focus on the quality of their services. Please remember the simple mantra that there is no mission without margin. Third, our frenzied pace of new hiring continues through the summer and fall for both early career as well as experienced professionals. In fact, we have added 125 new colleagues since the beginning of COVID, representing a 25% increase in our overall headcount. We're rounding up on our campus recruitment programs as we speak and are delighted that this year class will be the biggest in the history of the Company. With that operator, please open the call up for questions. Steve, that's a really good question. Let's talk about -- if you look at the history, you will see sequentially from Q3 to Q4, we usually have 20 to 40 basis points of average occupancy growth. We guided 440. So, if occupancy is obviously up meaningfully from that number, we gave you, what we are trying to give you is get away from this monthly, weekly numbers. We've got to run a long-term Company. But we can tell you, if the occupancy stays flat from here to the end of the quarter, we'll still hit our number.  Now let's talk about the fundamentals, not about guidance. We have -- we are seeing unprecedented level of demand and sales environment that we have never seen even this late into the year. If you look at how our October sales trends have ended and then how November has started, this is truly unprecedented. Now are we -- how are we going to protect that through the holiday season. We're just not in the business of doing that. We're running a long-term business, but I can tell you the momentum that we feel in the sales trend, which obviously translate into -- October sales trends translate into November and December occupancy. We have never seen this kind of momentum. That's all I'm willing to say. Amanda, we created a new slide in our slide deck. If you look at it, the inflation versus what we think our historic rate growth has been. Now remember that senior housing is not an income -driven sector, it's an asset -driven sector. Housing is obviously the primary 1, but the other things others too. That should frame what is possible from you. I will also tell you, just if you go back and read my prepared remarks, we talked about how there needs to be a price increase to offset labor increase. And you saw that that will also give you some bookends of what is possible.  Clearly, we know what the numbers are, because obviously you got to send letters 45, 60 days before, so we know what is being sent out. and the early feedback from some of our operators who have sustained obviously this entirely. And remember, we also have roles going through. Well, not the entire portfolio is [Indiscernible], so we have some early indications of as we have seen the spike of expenses and we have -- our operating partners have adjusted their pricing, how is that update, that what is behind my comment that I am very optimistic about pricing next year. But it is too early to comment. We'll talk about it in the February call. But I cannot emphasize it enough that we are very optimistic about the pricing increases. And frankly, the industry as a whole we need to do that if we need to make more revenue than expenses in this business. John, you're putting me in a pretty tough spot. I don't want to put a number out there, but I'm trying to avoid that. But if you look at the inflation versus rent chart that we provided, we intentionally provided that. If I were you, I would look at that. And then I would look at what that pricing power comes from, which is the housing and other asset rates and how people fund this expense. And you will get to a number, but I will tell you the industry overall, I just came back from the [Indiscernible] Conference. Industry is talking about substantial rate increases, not mediocre rating business. We have seen it across the board, but of different magnitude. As I mentioned the new operator that we brought in in Q3, the $172 million transaction to use zero agency [Indiscernible] And we have seen some operators where contract labor costs has gone up 10x in 6 months. I want to repeat Nick, 10x in 6 months, right? So obviously, you have seen a very different experience depending on who the operator is, but I will tell you also, all these management teams are very focused on bringing that number down significantly.  Our guidance, as Tim suggested, does not contemplate that you will see a step down in Q4, but we are already starting to hear -- as Jon said, we're already starting to hear that step down is taking place even in October going through November of the year. But we don't know what is going to happen in the holiday season. So, we're not going to sit here and speculate, right? Our goal is not to speculate on what's going to be a one-quarter number but go back to my comment, what I said, that stabilized margin of this portfolio -- I can talk about the industry. It is my firm belief that our margin will be higher than the pre-COVID margin on a stabilized basis. Mike, as I mentioned in the previous caution that Tim assumed that it will not improve. That's what's in the numbers of that we provided you. However, as I mentioned, that we are already starting to see improvement. The wild card here is how things play out in during the holiday season. We just don't know. Juan, exceptionally good question. It's actually my favorite topic. I like this topic more than even the rent increases. It is -- it's just I'm not going to mention any specific numbers. I will say -- let's just say that we're talking about X percent increase on average for the whole portfolio. From my operating partners, I'm hearing, the street level increase in the rate is between 1.5x to 2x. The Street is moving up faster than the renewal.  That's what I'm hearing from my operating partners. But we'll see how that plays out. This is a very interesting cycle that we're seeing. There has never been more focused on quality and safety. In previous cycles, if you have competed on, whether you are a new shiny penny on the corner or not, the cycle customers are focused on -- they've always focused on debt, but this cycle they're primarily focused on quality of services, quality of care, and the reputation of operators. They are not competing on price. So, Derek, I do not give guidance on how much transaction one to do. We're not a volume-driven investor, we're value-driven investor, that's the first point. The $5.6 billion significantly understate what that investment volume is. Just to give you a simple example, that -- what the transaction that we have closed represent the $5.6 billion that you mentioned, 25,000 units. Let's just think about it what that means. 25,000 units we have done had a $172,000 value unit pricing. In a normal environment, that would have been $10, $11, $12 billion of transaction. That's -- we got to put that into perspective.  Second, the industry remains very fragmented, and there is a lot of churn going on in ownership as people are finding it either this is -- if you are in 3 different businesses and you don't want to be in this business anymore, we're seeing as data from a lot of families. The labor pressured, obviously COVID was hard enough. Now the labor pressure challenge rising from this. And last few months, we have seen those repeat transaction that we had conversation a month ago. You recall I mentioned that when we are not getting to the finish line on a transaction, that's not because that's going to somewhere else. It really means that they're not selling.  At that price, they're not selling. And now we're seeing a lot of people are giving -- really giving up. Now remember, they can give up because we bring an operator to the table. You will not sell your real estate and continue to run it. The reason you are selling real estate that you don't want to run it. So, putting all this together, as I said in my prepared remarks, despite a significant acquisition volume, I remain very optimistic that this trend of acquisition at these kind of prices will continue finally -- frankly longer than I thought. Thank you. Tayo, welcome back. First, you pick ed the right slide to talk about. We do believe that diversification will continue, but there is going to be significant consolidation in the industry. Let me give you an example. A pretty good example to talk about. One of our best operating partner is operating partner in Midwest, named StoryPoint. You've heard several times about how highly I think of this team. Before pandemic, we've got an [Indiscernible] offer at an incredible price.  So, we sold the 13 buildings we had with StoryPoint and kept 2 new developments that recently -- at that point, opened. So, a big partner we went from 13 to 2. That was 2 years ago. Today, with all the transactions that we have done and all the transaction that is in pipeline, in that 2 years, frankly, through the pandemic in the last 18 months, we are back to 50-plus communities with StoryPoint. That tells you how the winners and losers are changing in the business. The market share of great operators is changing, right? I'll give you another example. Look at how many assets Oakmont managed.  It's a great example of a fantastic operator. Look at how many assets Oakmont managed 12 months ago, 18 months ago. And make it note on your calendar to see how Oakmont become -- has become a dominant player in California today, 12 months from now, 24 months from now. Right? This is just an example I'm trying to give you. So, you will see that shift of winners and losers, you have seen some spectacular failure of senior housing operators in the business and I can tell you those are not the only ones that you know of Absolutely. First, welcome to our call. We're glad to hear from you. If you think about inflation, inflation and -- most people thinking about inflation is a matter of how much not just obviously the supply side, but also the demand side and the people's ability to pay. Generally speaking, inflation is an Income concept, which obviously, as we all know, that's for most types of products and services. Senior housing is different. Senior housing is not an income-driven sector. It's an asset -driven sector. Look at that asset inflation of what happened.  Obviously, we tried to put together some slides to give you some sense of what happened to the people who are funding the residences, these expense. And you will see that asset inflation has never been more significant, aka the affordability of the product has never been better. So, I think you are onto something. As I've tried to say without putting a number, putting those 2 slides should give you a context of how much rent increases is possible, not just near-term, but over a long period of time. And frankly speaking, as I said, if you think about, we have a Bargel strategy in our portfolio.  If you go back and look at the Q4 of 19 call, This is the last call before COVID that I talked about in detail of how this barbell strategy work, where you have a high touch, high service product in the coast, our coastal type market, where you can -- where labor costs can be fully recovered and still in margin to be made. On the other hand, other side of the barbell are one that's housing portfolio, there's no labor. We have gone to that, and that diversification, we have been very, very focused and very intentional. So, between the 2, you will see a very significant inflation plus growth that's coming. That will be funded obviously to the asset inflation that already has happened. So, Mike, if you have to think about total rate versus real estate rates, because usually a portion comes in at a say, X level of care and then that goes up to say X plus 2 level of care. So, you've got to have to obviously think about when you say street trade versus in-place trend, do you mean just the total rate or the real estate rate? The real estate rate, if you just call it the relative component of the rent is not -- the street rates are lower. It is just that the operators are realizing that they're not competing just on price.  They e have a quality product, and that quality product people know -- I don't hear from my operating partners people are coming that I want to stay down the lane for $500 less my operating partners, so you should go ahead and do that. We're not going to -- there's a cost to provide the services, the first-class services that we provide. That's just not going to happen that you will cut it. You're not going to stay at Wisconsin for Hilton Garden's price. Nothing wrong with any of those models but that's just not the model. Right?  So, the street rate are going up because you have demand. Look at the take, what we are seeing even this kind of late into the year when you should have -- seasonally, we should have come off and we haven't. So as operators gain momentum on the sales side, they're realizing that our special product, there's a cost, obviously, of serving that piece of occupancy. And we have to charge for it. Very good question, Jordan. And thank you for getting 2 questions through that first time on the line. So, I'll answer both, and I hope I can remember it. Let's just try first. It's not an increased level of interest in the CCRC communities, we are value-driven real-estate investors, we saw a tremendous opportunity because of the [Indiscernible]. So, if I'd give you some details, we bought that portfolio for $195,000 a unit, and in -- with remarkable dark. So, talk about Westchester, New York, Dana Point, California, Bellevue, Washington, Alexandria. That level, that kind of dark. And then we thought what we can do with the dark. Then I mentioned obviously there is an example of the asset came with a piece of parcel that is the last residential zoned piece of land in residentially Bellevue.  When we look at a lot of CCRC, we continue to -- we always have we continue to look at, it's just we never seen this opportunity where we can do more than what we buy, not just leasing up obviously what we've done, but also a lot more what that can be done with the dot -- with the client entitlement. That's why we're interested in. As I mentioned, I will give you details of what I think that it can go from a high-single-digit and unlevered IRR to a low double-digit unlevered IRR as we execute on this. And frankly, we bought it.  That's where most of our returns have been focused on. We continue to get, call it between 9% to 12%, 13% on levered IRR, mostly transaction we have done, and the return life right there. Focused on the real estate value-add, one of the big real estate value-add that this Company tried to do is Vintage. As you are well aware of the fact that hasn't played out well for us. As I went through the experience, I realized that we didn't have the right talent. It's much more difficult to do it than obviously we taught.  And we stopped that whole focus on real estate value ad in a traditional sense of the real estate. As you know, John has done this for billions of dollars of transactions and executed based on that strategy. So, when we're talking to John, going back a few months ago, that's something that came up and now, obviously, John is the marched into that portfolio, and he is obviously one of the most important member of our investment committee.  So those opportunities we're now ready to really expand on and really execute on. It also as to what I mentioned, that we have built an extraordinary development team over the last 18 months under the leadership of Mike Ferry. We brought in Mike over a year ago and he has built a very large team. And so those are all thoughts that are all coming together. But it's a skill set we didn't have, and now, we do have it. Fantastic. I would highly recommend you go back and read the script, and you will see that we have detailed that out in our prepared remarks as well as in the other -- answering other questions. But I'll try to summarize it. First, you have to understand the confluence of factors having. Just purely focused on the labor side in the quarter. You people didn't travel for 18 months. And then that's the first time you've got a lot of PTOs being taken and that what caused a very significant demand because our operators provide PTOs, right? So, you've got a significant surge of that.  That's sort of understands our one aspect of what happens, 2), you got one extra day in the quarter. You get paid by obviously daily basis, but you get revenue in most cases on a monthly basis, that's second point. Third, you have to understand that when -- because of the rise of COVID, people are extra cautious. There's a reason there is no COVID in the communities. You've got sniffles and you called in and you should have called in.  But at that last moment look at the spike of the COVID through the quarter, majority of the we got obviously problems in July, but then we got a massive spike as you followed the COVID curve through August and September. We're on the other side of that, right? That's why if you put all of this together then obviously follow the opt-in state versus opt-out state comment that John made.  You'll understand it's not a question of optimism, we're actually seeing it. That we're on the other end of it. But only time will say, obviously how that exactly plays out, how much time that takes. But if you follow all these comments that we made, you can put together that picture pretty clearly. Nice, I would just add, if you look that compensation was Basis points year-over-year. So, to your point, occupancy a bit down still seeing compensation cost up, there is real base wage inflation. But the driver of that 4.1% year-over-year expense growth, the lion's share of it is being driven by agency. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2021 results, the performance of our Triple-net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a Balance Sheet liquidity update in addition to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.42 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share versus guidance of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios.  As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter in arrears. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30/2021. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the third quarter, have reflected 92% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period across our senior housing triple-net and long-term post-acute portfolios. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI declined 80 basis points year-over-year. As a negative year-over-year impact of leases moving the cash recognition began to dissipate. We expect same-store NOI growth to turn positive next quarter. Trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.83 times.  Looking forward, we expect coverages to bottom next quarter near current coverage levels before starting their recovery in Q1. Over the first 7 months of the recovery, we observed occupancy in EBITDA trends within our senior housing triple-net portfolio that are in line with our U.S. and UK operating portfolios. As these recovery trends have strengthened, the solvency risk of our operators has decreased in tandem, and our continued strong cash rent collection along with the value of the collateral that sits behind many of our lease agreements, continues to provide us confidence that Welltower's real estate position remains strong.  Next, our long-term [Indiscernible] portfolio generated -1% year-over-year same-store growth and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage of 1.25 times. In the quarter, we transitioned to 11 more Genesis assets new operators, bringing total year-to-date Genesis transitions to 48 properties. We also completed the disposition of 21 of these transition assets, bringing total year-to-date dispositions to 30 former Genesis assets, including our 9 Power back assets sold in the ProMedica joint venture in the second quarter. With another 14 scheduled for disposition in the coming months. Long-term post-acute in-place NOI concentration is now 5.4% of total portfolio in place NOI.  And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica senior care joint venture with a ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI with a positive 2.8% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.24 times. The drop in splinter coverage was driven largely by the timing of HHS stimulus. As the majority of HHS revenue received ProMedica was received in 2Q20, and this was not repeated in 2Q21. At HHS funds 2Q '21 EBITDA was up relative to 2Q '20. As revenue grew both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.  Our June trailing 12-month coverage also includes results of the previously announced sale of 25-assets held by the joint venture, 21 of which have already been sold to date with the remaining 4 expected to be completed in the coming months. These assets had contributed more than $30 million in negative EBITDA for the trailing 12-months period, ending 6/30/2021. And that their disposal alone will create considerable coverage accretion on a go-forward basis.  I'd also like to remind everyone that our lease is fully backed by a senior claim and the substantial real estate value held at the joint venture, and also the full corporate guarantee, the ProMedica Health System. Turning to capital market activity, we continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the Company to efficiently capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions.  Since the beginning of the third quarter, we sold 11.5 million shares via forward sale agreement, an initial weighted average price of approximately $84.36 per share for expected gross proceeds of $966 million. Since the beginning of the year, we have sold a total of 29.5 million shares of common stock via forward sale agreements, which are expected to generate total proceeds of $2.4 billion of which 12.7 million shares were settled during the third quarter, resulting in $1 billion of gross proceeds. At the end of the third -- of the quarter, we had approximately 11.8 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $1 billion.  When in the second quarter at 6.97 times net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, up slightly from an HHS adjusted 6.88 times at the end of the last quarter. The uptick in leverage was apprised of $1.7 billion of net investment activity completed the quarter. If we run rate the impact of the investment activity completed in the quarter, pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA decreased to 6.82 times. As a reminder, we ended the quarter of approximately $1 million once sell equity raised on a forward basis, along with $f309 million expected disposition proceeds in loan payoffs.  Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity profile, coupled with a recovery underway in our senior housing sector, have been recognized by S&P and Moody's with both rating agencies recently rating our credit outlook to stable. The upgrades validate the prudent measures Welltower's taken to mitigate risk through the pandemic and to appropriately capitalize our recent investment activity. On a forward-looking basis, as both Shankh and John noted, we continue to be pleased with the momentum of the recovery of the senior housing operating portfolio.  With portfolio occupancy ending the quarter at 76.7%, 210 basis points higher than at the end of the prior quarter, but still over 1,000 basis points below pre -COVID levels. The portfolio also sets 1,400 basis points below peak occupancy levels achieved prior to last decade supply wave, setting stage for a powerful EBITDA recovery. As occupancy upside and strong rate growth is coupled with significant margin expansion of a very depressed base.  Lastly, moving to our fourth quarter outlook. Last night, we provide d an outlook for the fourth quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.20 to $0.25, and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. This guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS or similar government programs in the UK and Canada. So, in comparing it sequentially to our third quarter normalized FFO per share, it be better to use an as-adjusted $0.79 per share for 3Q, which excludes $5 million in out-of-period [Indiscernible] and benefits that we received in the quarter.  On this comparison, the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, C/8.5 represents a C/1.5 sequential increase from 3Q. This C/1.5 increase is composed of C/3.5 over accretion from strong investment activity in the third quarter and a sequential increase in Seniors Housing Operating Portfolio, NOI, driven by an expected 140 basis points increase in sequential average occupancy. Offset by $0.02 of dilution from increase sequential G&A, an increased share count from share settled in the third quarter. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q2 2021 Welltower Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead.\nMatt McQueen: Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh?\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I hope that all of you and families are safe and healthy. Before I make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing, and on capital allocation environment, I want to welcome John Burkart, our Chief Operating Officer to this call. John joined Welltower last week after illustrious 25 year career to Essex. We believe he will make a tremendous long-term impact on our platform. Following my remarks, as usual, Tim will walk you through our operating and financial results. We're cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business as occupancy is starting to build and we're encouraged by nearly 200 basis points of spot to spot occupancy growth in second quarter, which clearly exceeded our expectations. Momentum in US continued to be strong, with lead generation returning to pre COVID levels, resulting in a 280 basis points occupancy gain in the quarter and the UK remain resilient despite the rise in the Delta variant cases being driven by the younger cohorts. Though, we are monitoring the situation closely we have seen very little impact to the portfolio so far as UK case counts more broadly appear to be decreasing rapidly after recent spike. While Canada was a drag on occupancy, we are witnessing some green shoots following a material decline in COVID cases. In fact, tours almost doubled in June from April and May in Canada, as provinces have removed moving restrictions and are now permitting in person tours. For our overall portfolio, June was particularly impressive month with move in exceeding 2019 level for the first time since the beginning of pandemic. I'm also encouraged that our operators were able to achieve these occupancy gains, while holding rate reflecting the need based nature of our asset class, and strong value proposition of this business. Year-over-year same store revPAR is up 3.2% across our assisted living properties, 2.8% across our independent living properties, and 5.3% across our wellness housing communities. The strength in same store revPAR was primarily driven by our highest end luxury products in primary coastal markets. Having said that, I'll caution you that there is still significant uncertainty and many unknowns related to the path of COVID. And it is too early to signal an all clear. However, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making towards achieving the substantial embedded NOI growth in our Show portfolio. Last quarter, we provided details of nearly $0.5 billion of NOI upside, which assumes a return to fourth quarter 2019 occupancy and margin levels. We're pleased to report that we not only achieved $71 million towards this total goal in one quarter, but also added another $29 million potential upside through the second quarter of acquisition and development deliveries. Going forward, we'll still have another $430 million to NOI upside in that business. Again, this only assumes a return to pre COVID occupancy with potential upside from high rates and return to frictional vacancy, which is mid to high single digits. Turning to capital allocation, last fall when we have made a significant pivot from defense to offense, we made it explicit bet that consumers will return to this new trend business with 400 basis points of occupancy ramp in US from March trough with healthy rates, it appears that we're on the right side of that bet. Over the past three quarters we have deployed $4 billion of capital at extremely attractive pricing during a time when others were fearful. But we remain paranoid optimists and our humility and lack of complacency are pushing us to test our hypotheses, and underwrite everything we look at with conservatism. And you can rest assured that we look at pretty much everything in our space. Therefore, we are only willing to pay a price per unit that does not require everything to go right for our owners to make a reasonable return. The second quarter was one of the best quarters from a capital deployment perspective, having closed approximately $1.4 billion of growth investments. Q3 will likely top Q2, and we anticipate that it will be another record quarter of investment activity for the company. We started Q3 with a bang. And so far in July, we have already closed $230 million of gross investment and expect our previously disclosed Holiday transaction to close in third quarter as well. While it is fun to talk about large transactions like Holiday, which I'll get to in a minute, I want to point out that our core strategy and strength is granular transaction with a diverse group of operating partners, and is supported by our data analytics platform. Our COVID class, which I define as anything we bought is turning to offense in Q4 of last year, now exceeds $4 billion of gross investment activity, including Holiday, across 37 transactions with 24 unique partners. In the US, that would on average be $16.6 million per community, or $161,000 per unit, which we believe represents a significant discount to replacement costs. The pipeline remained very strong with many owners and operators eager to join our operator and data platform. Let me give you some examples. First, I'm very pleased to announce that we'll expand our relationship with John Moore and his team at Atria while Lilly and her team and Holiday will join our platform. We're buying 80 nearly identical Holiday Independent Living assets at more approachable end of senior living spectrum with an addition of six more combination AIL assets for a total consideration of $1.58 billion or $152,000 per unit. Our base remains compelling even after our anticipated investment of $1.5 million to $2 million of CapEx by community to bring them to tomorrow standard. While the lease up of this portfolio from the compelling basis through -- a double digit unlevered IRR, we believe there are few opportunities to enhance our return. Number one, our underwritten rent growth is 2.5% per year, despite a heavy investment in the portfolio that will improve asset quality and marketability. Our 2026 underwritten rent remains $700 to $800 below feasibility rent to make development pencil. Two, we have a significant expansion opportunity in 10 plus assets which we expect will generate a double digit return on invested capital; three, the optimization of six AIL buildings under Atria platform and four, there are at least five higher and better use opportunities and a couple of them are so significant that they may generate enough proceeds to pay for a significant portion of the CapEx investment for the whole portfolio. If we are successful in this effort, we will have a completely renovated portfolio at roughly out going in basis, which will enhance our IRR materially. Moving forward from Holiday, I like to make the operative specific comments on this call. First, while we continue to be encouraged by Jack Callison's at Sunrise. Jack is refocusing the organization as a premier Senior Living brand in North America. We are excited about this focus growth strategy and brought Sunrise in to run a recently acquired community in the Philadelphia metro area. This is our first acquisition initiative with Sunrise in several years, and believes we'll have many opportunities to grow together. In the UK Sunrise platform and portfolio will be acquired by Signature and Care UK Signature is an existing Welltower operating partner which runs our high fin communities in the UK. We're tremendously excited to welcome Care UK to our platform, which is one of the most well respected and largest Senior Living operators in the UK, with the addition of 81 on the value end and Care UK on the higher end along with our existing operating partners, the barbell approach to portfolio construction that we have taken in the US which is all an -- which we always aspired to be in the UK is beginning to take shape. We're very excited about Care UK technology and management platform. We're also thrilled to welcome Pathway Living to Welltower's operating platform, which we believe opens another avenue for growth for us. Next, I'm excited to announce our expanded partnership with Oakmont Management Group, which is one of our strongest and best operating partners. This expanded partnership with Courtney and her team is expected to result in a nearly doubling of our time portfolio together in California. We're also embarking on a long-term exclusive development program together to meaningfully expand our relationship in the next decade. Fun fact, Oakmont is our first operator in our portfolio to return to the 90% occupancy mark post COVID, a reflection of Oakmont's operating acumen and market strength. Finally, I'm excited to announce our new partnership with Chris Smith and his team at Aspect Health. We recap Aspect's existing MOB portfolio in Connecticut and at New York and entered into a long term Development Partnership with Chris. We believe a combination of our data and operating capabilities with Aspect's relationships, and development talent will create significant opportunities for growth for both companies. We're already on our first development together, which will be a 60,000 square feet outpatient medical building located at a very attractive market in the New York metropolitan area. The property will be master leased to a leading health system for 20 years and is expected to start construction early next year. Speaking of growth opportunities, I'm pleased to announce our continued growth with the Bremner organization. In the next, in the second quarter, our partnership closed on the first building of a large development near Norman, Oklahoma with Normal Retail Health System. The total development cost for phase one of this multi phase development is expected to be in excess of $100 million, consisting of 181,000 rentable square feet, a classy outpatient medical facilities. Our significant MOB development platform pipeline, which is 100% leased, is now in excess of 1 million square feet and will create significant value for our shareholders in a very tight acquisition market. All of these operating and development partnerships make us the foundation for our core belief that centralized capital allocation and decentralized execution releases entrepreneurial energy while keeping costs and politics at bay. We are very proud that we have formed 50 new operators and develop relationships since the beginning of pandemic. And we have a handful more in the works. The implication of our rapidly growing operator and development platform are vast, including a network effect, whereby addition of more operators creates exponentially recent data set, and thus stronger and attractive an analytics platform. This dramatically enhances the informational advantage we're already positive through our best-in-class with analytics platform, which forms the basis of our capital allocation decision. Needless to say, these relationships create foundation for significant capital deployment opportunities, as each one of them are attracted world vehicle on their own right. This Lollapalooza effect of intertwining operating and data platform has created a wide and increasingly deeper mode for Welltower. As Tim will speak to you in a moment, we're very pleased to with our progress to further strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity profile. More specifically, our sequential adjusted EBITDA growth of roughly $50 million indicates that we're on our way to deleverage organically as senior housing properties unfold. Overall, we're very happy with our execution so far in the year to create cost share value for our shareholders. We're cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment, and excited about our opportunities to acquire and develop talent, create new relationships, and attract quality partners, which will result outside internal and external growth for years to come. After retooling our assets and portfolio operators, and building a formidable predictive analytics platform and talent base, and growing with conviction following two negative cycles superimposed on each other, resulting from oversupply and COVID, I'm happy to say that we're emerging as a partner of choice, an employer of choice and an investor of choice on the other side of this pandemic. With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim?\nTim McHugh: Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, balance sheet liquidity and update in addition to our outlook for the third quarter. The time of our last earnings call on April 29, we were six weeks into an occupancy recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, which has seen total portfolio occupancy increased 67 basis points on March 12 lows or an average increase of 11 basis points per week. In the 13 weeks that have followed, we've seen the occupancy recovery accelerate, adding an additional 204 basis points through July 23, an average pace of 16 basis points per week, bringing the portfolio wide occupancy recovery since March 12 to 271 basis points. The recovery continues to be uneven across the portfolio, with the US leading in 401 basis points since March 12, followed by the UK at 275 basis points. And lastly, Canada, which has seen a net decrease of 88 basis points over this time period. We believe these geographic discrepancies will normalize over time as the reopening of both Canada and the UK catches up to the US. Looking forward despite the uncertainty around the path of COVID in the near term, particularly the spread of the new variants, we continue to both gain evidence that the vaccines are exceptionally effective at protecting our residents and staff from this evolving virus and gain confidence with the permanent demand impairment thesis that surrounded the senior housing asset class in much of the last year and a half to becoming significantly less probable. Now turning to the quarter; Welltower reported net income attributed to common stockholders of $0.06 per diluted share, and normalized FFO of $0.79 per diluted share. First initial guidance of $0.72 to $0.77 per share, and our June guidance update of $0.75 to $0.79 per share, which included a $5 million benefit from HHS Provider Relief Funds. We ultimately recognize that $5 million benefit from HHS Funds and also recognize an additional $4.9 million a reimbursement payments for similar programs in Canada and the UK. After adjusting for the impact of these funds, our normalized FFO per diluted share in the quarter is $0.77. Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported one quarter in years. These statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 3/31/2021. Importantly, our collection rates remain high in the second quarter, having collected 95% of triple-net contractual rent during the period. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio same store NOI declined 2.7% year-over-year, as leases that were moved to cash recognition in prior quarters continued to comp against prior year full contractual rent received. And trailing 12 months EBITDA coverage was 0.89x. As I've stated in the past, the timing and scope for the recovery in our senior housing portfolio will dictate whether or not disruption from COVID to underlying fundamentals generates a short term liquidity issue or solvency problem for triple-net operators. Over the first four months of recovery, we've observed occupancy and EBITDA trends within this portfolio that are in line with our US and UK operating portfolios. As these recovery trends strengthen the solvency risk for operators has decreased in tandem. In our continued strong cash rent collection in the quarter is the best evidence we have this.  The value of the collateral that sits behind many of our lease agreements continue to allow us to work with our operators to enhance near term liquidity without impairing the value of Welltower of real estate position. Next, our long term post acute portfolio generating negative 1.1% year-over-year same store growth and trailing 12 months EBITDA coverage was 1.29x. In the quarter, we transition 40 of the 51 plan Genesis transition assets to new operators, including nine power back assets transition to ProMedica. With the remaining 11 schedule to transition in the third quarter. 35 of these assets are expected to be disposed out the third quarter. With the expected third quarter Genesis dispositions and the $75 million sales in Altech portfolio in the quarter. Welltower's percentage placed NOI generates long term post acute segment will be reduced to 5.6%. And Genesis Healthcare will represent less than 90 basis points of total company in place NOI. And lastly, health systems, which are comprised by ProMedica Senior, care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. At same store NOI growth of positive 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12 EBITDA coverage was 1.25x. Turning to medical office; our outpatient medical segment delivered 2.2% year-over-year same store growth due to improved platform profitability and increased property level expense recovery. Occupancy in our same store portfolio ended the quarter at 94.8%, a 20 basis points sequential increase versus first quarter. The strong growth is driven by executed new leasing totaling 178,000 square feet, the highest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019 and supported by 94% retention in the quarter. That's consistent renewal activity was paired with reduced vacancies. Also during the quarter we delivered one purpose built medical office building at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. While the two recently converted Stanley MOB in Charlotte with Atrium Health. These building sold 449,000 square feet of fully occupied space with highly credited health systems. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio, before getting into this quarter's results, I want to provide some color on the recently announced transfer of the Sunrise UK operating platform to two local operators, Signature Senior Lifestyle and Care UK. We're excited to take this opportunity to deepen our local operator relationships. The Sunrise UK portfolio consists of 46 predominantly private pay properties located primarily in southern New England, the portfolio is being split largely by geographic focus. The property is located in Greater London moving to Signature, a premium operator with its Welltower had a relationship since 2012. And the rest of the properties moving the Care UK, a new member of the Welltower operating family and the fourth largest independent care home operate in the UK with the focus on the private pay market. Turning to government grants. In the quarter, we received approximately $5 million from Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act Provider Relief Fund. As we've done in past quarters, these funds are recognized on a cash basis and as such will go through financials the quarter they're received. We're normalizing HHS Funds out of our same store metrics however; along with any other government funds received they're not matching expenses incurred in the period they're received. In the second quarter, there are approximately $9.3 million of reimbursements normalized out of our same store senior housing operating results. Now turning to results for the quarter. Year-over-year same store NOI decreased 17.6% as compared to 2Q 2020 driven by a 670 basis point decrease in year-over-year average occupancy. The COVID related decline in occupancy that began in March of 2020 came to a halt in mid March of this year, and portfolio wide occupancy increased by approximately 230 basis points from March 12 to the end of June. With a 190 basis points taking place in the second quarter. The Stanley occupancy recovery and the accompanying operating market expansion have created an inflection point for bottom line results. And sequential same store NOI increased 11.2% in the first to the second quarter. Sequential same store revenue was up 1.8% in Q2, driven primarily by 40 basis point increase in average occupancy and sequential monthly revPAR increase of 1.3%. With respect to expenses, total same store expenses decreased 40 basis points sequentially, and declined 2.9% year-over-year. I'll focus on the sequential change since this is more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 40 basis point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower COVID costs, as case counts remain near zero for all the second quarter after spiking meaningfully in the first quarter. Costs were also driven lower sequentially by seasonal utility costs, as a spring and early summer have lower utility costs relative to Q1. The net result is a resilient rental rates and rebounding occupancy combined with a decrease in total expenses, with a sequential margin improvement in our same store pool of 180 basis points to 21.2%. Looking forward to the third quarter, starting with July quarter to date data we've already observed. We've experienced a 40 basis point increase in occupancy through July 23. With the US and UK up 60 and 30 basis points respectively while Canada is flat. Despite the strength of recovery so far, particularly in the US, we remain cautious not projecting the acceleration in trends from the second quarter to the third quarter, given the continued lack of historical precedents with which to forecast and also uncertainty around COVID variant. Despite seeing promising resilience in our UK portfolio over the last month, as a surge in the Delta variant infections amongst the general population has not been echoed amongst our resident population. There remains uncertainty, particularly around how national and local authorities may react in the coming months. If the surge continues or accelerate in our other geographies. On a spot basis, we're currently projecting an approximate 190 basis point increase in occupancy from June 30 through September 30. We expect revPAR to be up 1% to 1.5% up sequentially and up 2.5% year-over-year. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be up 1.5% to 2% sequentially driven by a combination of occupancy driven labor utilization and seasonal utility costs, offset slightly by continued declines in COVID costs. The net result in sequential changes will be expected flow through margins in the mid 60s, inclusive of the seasonal utility increase and mid 70s normalizing for the seasonality of utility costs.  Turning to capital market activity. In June, we expanded our existing unsecured credit facility to $4.7 billion after closing on a $4 billion unsecured revolving line of credit which replaced our previous $3 billion revolver. Revolving facility bears interest and LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points representing a five basis point improvement from pricing under our previous revolver. The facility was supported by 31 incumbent and new banks and highlights the incredible support of our banking partners. On June 28, we completed the issuance of $500 million for senior unsecured notes due January 2029. Bearing interest at 2.05%. Proceeds from the offering were used to pay down borrowings in our revolving line of credit, and to pay down the remaining balance of our COVID term loan put in place in April of 2020. Additionally, in the quarter, we extinguish $674 million of senior unsecured notes due 2023 using proceeds for March 25, 2021 bond issuance, improving our weighted average maturity across senior unsecured notes to 8.2 years. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to efficiently capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. By utilizing our ATM program to fund those near term transactions, having sold 20.1 million shares to just beginning of the second quarter via forward sale agreement and the initial weighted average price of approximately $80 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.6 billion. Since the beginning of the year, we've sold a total of 22.3 million shares of common stock via forwards sale agreements which are expected to generate a total of $1.8 billion in proceeds of which 5 million shares were settled during the second quarter, resulting in $372 million in gross proceeds. And capital deployment opportunities continue to materialize. We'll look to fund those opportunities while maintaining ample liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. We ended the second quarter 6.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, 6.88x when adjusting out $5 million of HHS Funds received in the quarter. This HHS is adjusted in 2Q '21 leverage number represents a 0.25x decline from the prior quarter's 7.13x debt to EBITDA adjusted for HHS. Last quarter, I highlighted the impact of the recovery in senior housing fundamentals would have underlying EBITDA and cash flow based leverage metrics. We are encouraged to see this trend take shape as a 15% sequential improvement in EBITDA contribution from senior housing operating grow the entirety of the HHS adjusted improvement and debt to EBITDA. The total portfolio in occupancy sitting at 74.6% at quarter end, 12.6% below pre COVID levels and approximately 16.6% below peak levels achieved prior to last decade supply wave. We believe the stage is set for powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside is a couple of margin expansion of a very depressed base. Lastly, moving to our third quarter outlook; last night we provide an outlook for the third quarter of net income attributed common stockholders per diluted share of $0.44 to $0.49 and normalize FFO per diluted share of $0.78 to $0.83. This guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS Funds or similar government programs in the UK and Canada. So in comparing it sequentially to our second quarter normalized FFO per share, it'd be better to use the as adjusted $0.77 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes data period benefits of both programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our third quarter guidance $0.885 per share represents a $0.035 sequential increase from 2Q. The $0.035 increases comprised of a $0.03 per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs. A $0.02 per share increase from strong net investment activity highlighted by the expected closing of the Holiday Senior Living portfolio during the third quarter, result in dilution from dispositions relating to our previously communicated reduction exposure to Genesis. And $0.05 increased NOI from recently converted development mainly two fully leased MOBs in Charlotte, North Carolina and Brooklyn. These increases are offset by $0.01 per share increase in sequential G&A driven mainly by new hires, and $0.01 dilution from share settled in the second quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. I wanted to conclude by expanding on a team that I mentioned before, we're engaged in two small transactions with two other REITs our sector, that are not material to any company that involved. We are buying a handful of assets in one transaction and selling a handful of assets in other transaction. Those dollars involved are too small to be mentioned on this call, but I bring them up as I think they reflect a new era of collaboration amongst public REIT. Both of these transactions which will result in favorable outcomes for all of our respective shareholders on a transactional basis. But what's important to focus is an emerging theme amongst public REIT, the life doesn't have to be a zero sum game. With that the operator we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.\nVikramMalhotra: Thanks so much and good morning, everyone. I guess Shankh and Tim. The one thing that sort of surprised me was the revPAR growth that you saw on a like for like basis. I think most people would have anticipated in this period of still occupancy recovering and low occupancy, there'll be more discounting. So I guess just on the expense side, two questions. One, did this surprise you? And what drove that? And second, if this revPAR continues into kind of the next few quarters, what does that say about sort of the margin and the cash flow recovery into '22? Thanks.\nShankhMitra: Vikram, I'll try to take a stab at that. So did it surprise us? Yes, it did. If you think about last quarter call, I said despite all the noise of discounting another so when I said that our operators have a very special product and a very special value proposition that just they're not willing to discount. And but having said that, I didn't expect this kind of pricing strength yet. It was entirely driven by our highest end luxury product in coastal markets, as I said; do we expect it to continue? Yes, we do. In fact, we, as Tim pointed out in his prepared remarks; we expect that to accelerate into Q3. And so look, I mean, from the perspective of the stage is set by a very powerful recovery of margin and cash flow increase as we come through, but we're very, very excited about what's going on. And at the same time there's a lot of uncertainty, we're not in this for next quarter next month. This is a long term business. We're excited about what we're seeing. But most importantly, as Tim pointed out, we think that we're increasingly getting to a point that is really validating our belief that the business which is frankly, it was when we said this last year, around this time, that is validating our belief that the product is needed, and the consumers will be back and we're seeing that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer from Baird.\nAmandaSweitzer: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with a quick clarification on your occupancy guidance. When think about your spot occupancy guidance versus where average occupancy will end up for the quarter, it looks like it might be a different setup from recent quarters, and average occupancy could actually end up exceeding spot occupancy in the third quarter. Is that the right way to think about it?\nTimMcHugh: That's correct, Amanda. The right way to think about is using about 1Q and 2Q. And the first quarter, because of the decline in occupancy, we saw that lasted for two and a half months of the quarter, we actually finished for spot occupancy was below average occupancy in 1Q, we have the opposite effect in 2Q where the increase typically in June has driven spot occupancy above average for the second quarter. So thinking about our spot occupancy, guidance to 190 basis points on kind of a spot basis and equates to 210 basis points on an average change from 2Q to 3Q.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America.\nJoshuaDennerlein: Yes, good morning, everyone. Just kind of curious to hear about your MOB pipeline. And then just aspect how there are other sharpshooters out there you'd be interested in working with?\nShankhMitra: Josh, thank you for that question. And our MOB pipeline, if you're asking about acquisition, that pipeline is zero. And if you're asking about development pipeline, it's actually a million plus square feet fully leased, 100% leased pipeline, we continue to believe that the pricing that we're seeing in MOB market doesn't make any sense of our long term perspective. So we remain out of the market. We did this transaction specifically, because we see a very significant growth opportunity with Chris and his team. And are we willing to partner with more sharp -- local sharp protests? Absolutely, yes. But it\u2019s purely on a transactional basis. We have not a lot of interest in that space right now. We think what we are seeing the opportunity to flood capital and make significant amount of return for our shareholders in the senior housing space is compelling. And that's where the capital deployment opportunities in the near term will be focused on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.\nSteveSakwa: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Shankh, I was just wondering if you could talk about what your operator policies are with respect of activation. So there's been a lot written about healthcare workers, so some not wanting to get it. And I just wonder, does this create any kind of hang up in terms of move in or when you're marketing assets, so maybe just kind of provide around the horn or kind of broad update on kind of where your operator stand and whether you've seen any issues?\nTimMcHugh: Yes, Steve, it certainly differs across operators. I'd say as far as the question around, hang up and move ins, the effectiveness of the vaccine and the lack of cases we've seen in the buildings across all three of our geographies, this point is really prompt the marketing around the operator policies. That being said, a large majority of our employees, the property level are vaccinated along with 90%, upper 90% of our residents. So the highly vaccinated at a facility environment across the board. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.\nMichaelCarroll: Yes. Thanks. I wanted to go back to the revPAR growth. I know that your operators have done a good job driving modest growth, even at these occupancy levels. I mean, how does this dynamic change when occupancy gets back to the high 80% range? I guess I'm trying to understand how much does this rate growth vary, I mean are changes generally more muted both on the downside or upside? Or can we expect the total portfolio to generate significantly stronger revPAR growth once occupancy comes back to stabilization?\nShankhMitra: Mike, that's a very, very good question. Now you're asking me to speculate. So I will speculate, but it's speculation nonetheless but if you think about the occupancy as we get back, sort of to the more stabilized occupancy level, you just call it high 80%, I think you will see significant pricing power, even above what you have seen sort of these quarters or this particular quarter, let me remind you through the supply cycle, sort of call it from '15 to '19, when our occupancy has gone down, we have still raise rate about 4%, right, in face of a supply cycle, which I expect the setup is completely different. This cycle or this decade forward where you have better demand and probably in a better environment for supply as well. So is it -- should we see once stabilization happens, greater pricing power, we absolutely should. But it remains to be seen, as I will tell you one of the things that we interestingly watch, is that very tight correlation of housing price appreciation, and pricing power in senior housing industry. And we have seen a significant increase in a record household sort of wealth growth. And that hasn't really translated so far into senior housing pricing. We probably starting to see some of that this quarter, but it will come through.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from SMBC.\nRichAnderson: Thanks. Good morning. So when you take into account the embedded NOI that you go through in the deck, and you hold everything else constant, you're kind of 50% shop and 20% senior housing adjusted for all of that, I know, that's not absolutely precision, but you're clearly focused on the senior housing business. And I know your thesis has always been your IRR investors and you think more about that than certain asset classes, but you're the REIT, senior housing REIT relative to your peers like it or not, at least for now. I'm curious as your underwriting deals and kind of tethering yourself to the business. What are you thinking about in terms of the next supply cycle? We've seen that to be the risk for this business in the past, lumber prices are coming back down. I'm wondering how you're underwriting the future for supply and how you're making sense of the growth in this side of the business.\nShankhMitra: Thank you, Rich. That's a very, very good question. So we continue to believe as I said before, that you will see some supply but you will not see this cycle. We believe that supply will chase demand instead of demand chasing supply, like you've seen last decade if we see no supply, we have bigger issues, right, that says that we're the only people who actually see the business. Everybody else is missing, that's not how many is going to happen. But I wouldn't react to short term, high frequency data on these things. Because these data is obviously comes with a lot of errors and noises, the similar types of data that you have been supplied would have told you that occupancy for us for the quarter would be down with negative pricing, that clearly didn't happen.  So I wouldn't react too much to the high frequency data from one or two providers, I will tell you that forget about what others are doing. We are looking at a lot of development. And they're very, very hard to pencil; they are very hard to pencil, given feasibility rent remains between 20% and 30% below depending on different markets. And that just a question of how much rents have sort of cost has gone down, cost has gone up. And a high frequency indicator like lumber price on a Bloomberg screen doesn't tell you that it has changed significantly, you got to look at our long term average and people's ownership of that than sitting in the warehouse, and it hasn't shown up yet. Will it show up? Probably it will show up at some point. But that's it. At the same time, you're seeing a lot of other products, cost is going up, the country is significantly undersupplied on overall housing, and you will see housing starts will continue to go up with the demand of different materials.  So I think that a lot of lessons have been learned on the bank side, losing a lot of money in this space, a lot of equity has lost a lot of money, clearly, you can see why we're buying new products at significantly below replacement cost. And the gap between where we're buying, call it $0.60 on the dollar and the $1 if somebody lost a lot of money, right. And so it was obviously these lessons will be remembered in the near term as the demographic catch on. But we are very much aware of what you are saying this is why we're so focused on price per unit. And that's why I made the point I made during my prepared remarks that we're not willing to buy anything and everything, even if we think it's a decent deal. Because in many cases, a lot of these things as a long term investor in the space, a lot of these things need to go right over a period of time for us, our shareholders to make money. And that's not the kind of investment I do make.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James.\nJonathanHughes: Hey, good morning. I do agree with Rich you are the seniors housing REIT, but I want to ask about the health system portfolio. And what happened to EBITDA coverage there. I see it's one and a quarter turns now from 1.9 last quarter. And then could you also maybe talk about exposure to operators at less than one times EBITDA coverage without naming names? Are there any ongoing discussions with operators for maybe the rate deferrals or transitions across your triple-net segments? Thank you.\nShankhMitra: Thank you, Jonathan. So first, coverage came down for obvious reasons, right you are -- you're still remember the NOI has trough last quarter is still coming down right from an trailing four quarter basis is how you report coverages, which means the better quarters are getting out of numbers. And worst quarters are getting in the numbers due mostly speaking in a normalized in a stabilized environment, coverage should give you the state of the business at inflection points like this, where you've got sharp decrease and sharp increases, it will not give you the state of the business. There's just like our other offers that you're seeing in shop, part of the portfolio, the fundamentals have trough last quarter, and it's actually getting better. So for example, let's just talk about ProMedica. I don't want to get into this because frankly speaking for our investors, ProMedica overage is a huge element metric because as I told you before, that ProMedica rent is guaranteed by the health system, the mother ship at the top end, right. So it's really is irrelevant metric for our investors.  However, having said that let me make some observations about that topic. The revenue if you think about versus second quarter was the highest actually for ProMedica for that specific business for [Indiscernible] was the highest in last five quarters. They have seen significant increase sequential increase in occupancy, just this quarter, about 400 basis points in that skilled nursing business. And you know what is going on is there is Midlock as we and ProMedica in Midlock selling a bunch of asset, right? And those asset base is going through -- has a negative EBITDA as I talked about before when we announced the deal, and that still flowing to the number and creating significant noise on the number side. So that is absolutely is sort of going to create a lot of issues. And also on the same side, you were seeing, we add a nine Powerback building that is getting integrated. So you have a lot of noise. I will tell you, let's take a step back and think about what the business is trending. Business as I said, the second quarter revenue was the highest actually in last five orders. Business is getting better. ProMedica team, senior care team is doing exactly what we laid it out that they will happen, which is you're creating new partnership with different system, we announced it, they announced a new partnership MetroHealth in Cleveland, there's another one they signed a joint venture, which I'm not at the liberty naming name right at this point is a premier system in the country, business is moving forward.  But as far as wealth of our shareholders are concerned that rent is guaranteed by the mother ship, which obviously is a very significant system with two plus billion dollars of cash and material in a $7 billion of revenue. So I don't want to get into that conversation. Remember, at this point in Jonathan, just not just talking about ProMedica but any triple-net leases will not reflect the state of the business because of the fourth quarter trailing nature of how we report coverages. From a standpoint of your second question, I think Tim touched on it. I will still say again, we have told you before that we believe that our leases are backed by material amount of credit and assets that we own in joint ventures and other assets owned by the operators, we do not believe there will be significant disruption of earnings and cash flow coming out of that. And our belief, that statement is getting stronger and stronger every day. That's how much I'm willing to talk about any specific operator at this call. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from J.P. Morgan.\nMikeMueller: Oh, hi. My question was just answered. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets.\nJuanSanabria: Hi, thanks for the time. Just curious on the acquisition pipeline, you guys have done a tremendous amount of work and heavy lifting and kudos to you. But the markets always about what come next. So just curious on your views of what's in the pipeline going forward? And how long do you think you can take advantage of this COVID dislocation and for the deals that you're striking now, how should we think about when those were negotiated? I'm not sure you could talk to Holiday more broadly about when those deals were really struck versus just to think about that the runway for future discounted replacement cost opportunities.\nShankhMitra: Thank you, Juan. I completely agree with you. It's about what comes next. That's the point I was trying to make on the coverage metric, right. It's the state of what's happening now. And what's happening next, not what happened yesterday. Having said that, I'll tell you, it's important to understand when we talk about acquisition. Unlike many companies, we don't talk about what's under contract, unless it is a very large transaction that shareholders should know about. The holidays are a good example. So the $4 billion or so of COVID class is transaction that we have closed, we could have given you a significantly higher number of the transaction we have taken our hands on. So pipeline, I know you understand that. But I wanted to make a very concerted effort to make that point again, because it's very different from how most other companies report their numbers. So the pipeline, let's just talk about pipeline, which is where we have shaken hands, we have agreed on a transaction and it is going through the process. Well, it's the transactions take long time to close, as you know we're pretty quick, we are quicker than probably most other organizations that you will meet but we're also extremely thorough, right? So it takes time, we visit every property that we buy. So it takes time. So let's just talk about that pipeline, which we define as something that's under contract that's visible. That is significant, and it's under contract. So we feel very, very good about continued momentum on the acquisition side. Let's talk about the shadow pipeline, which I define as something that we're negotiating right now, that is also significant and visible. And I think you will see continued acquisitions at very, very favorable price. As I said before, going forward, as I've said before, we're driven by value of acquisition, not volume of it, right. So as long as we can create value will continue to occur. And if we see that market prices are moved to a place where doesn't make sense, we will not. And for it could be a lip service, but you can look at our history. And you will see that we have exactly done that. We have moved with market pricing, and if market pricing and got into a place where we think it doesn't make sense, we sold assets. So near term, we see tremendous amount of opportunities by this -- all this disruption in the market. And we're seeing tremendous opportunity, because there are several operators, and developers want to join our platform to access the data that we talked about for several quarters on this call. So sum it all together. I'm very, very optimistic about capital deployment opportunities, at very attractive price in coming quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi.\nNickJoseph: Thanks. Are you seeing any of your operators take additional pre emptive measures with a Delta variant? And then are you seeing any recent changes to state or local restrictions?\nTimMcHugh: Hi, Nick. Good question. We have not seen significant changes at state level restrictions and my comments in my script promote towards kind of the uncertainty around that going forward, there's obviously a lot of noise around kind of where things may change and where they've been the last, the most recent months. And the operator front our operators never, you think about sort of like a mask mandate, our operators never left the mask mandate. So you think about just the general facility and the way that they've been being run, there has not and likely will not be much of a change, depending on obviously the path of the virus, but to kind of what's going on in the general public last few months, because the operators continue to run a very safe, stringent environment when it comes to COVID.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordanSadler: Thanks, and Good morning, guys. So Shankh, I want to come back to your comment on moving swiftly. I know it's early, and the pandemic is not over. But your bet on seniors housing seems to be playing out better than expected. With occupancy improvements accelerating and now revPAR growth coming through, how is this impacting your underwriting of new investments? And even on the asset management side of the portfolio, how's it impacting your thinking?\nShankhMitra: Thank you, Jordan. Look, I mean, when we made last year this bet for example, I'll tell you this is exactly your one year mark, when we first have started this discussion with Oakmont how to grow this business significantly, as a partnership yesterday marked exactly one year. But the times were scary, right? I mean, there's no question about it, occupancy was falling, like a rock EBITDA obviously was going down materially given on the high operating leverage in the business. But we had unwavering belief that the product is needed and that consumers will return, right? That doesn't mean that we knew for sure that will happen. That's the bet we made. And that bet actually made sense on a risk adjusted basis. And we talked about that, over last four calls. And I am very pleased that we recognized that bet seems to be playing up. So how is it changing? Look, at the end of the day, if you -- you have to think about real estate is a game of basis, right? No matter how good the environment is, or how bad the environment is, there's a floor and ceiling of value depending on what it costs to build. So we are not going to say that it's all clear. Things are fantastic.  Let's just pay prices that are above replacement cost and acquire as much asset because we can't because we have a cost of capital. That is not how we run this place. Cost to just, we have a cost of capital; our owners have given us a cost of capital, our bondholders have given us the cost of capital so that we can accrue value to our owners. Not because we want to accrue value to the sellers. And that is how we have always run this place and that is how will always run this place. There is no dearth of opportunity, we're not significantly changing our underwriting and frankly speaking we are basis investor, an IRR investor. So you might say okay, you're long term in 10 year IRR or 15 year IRR really hasn't changed, has your near term growth rates have changed? Yes, it has. But that doesn't translate into higher prices, because we're still solving for the same IRR. And we're still really focused on what the price per unit price per foot is. Hopefully that helps you to get a glimpse of how we underwrite. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.\nNickYulico: Thanks. Just going back to the senior housing guidance for the third quarter. Tim, I Know you talked about this earlier that it's a little bit hard to predict acceleration. But I guess I'm wondering how much did the July numbers sort of impact guidance, right? Because you're -- I think you said you're up 40 basis points so far, in July, as of last week. And I guess I'm just wondering is that sort of running a little bit slower than June, at the end of the day, June is a very strong month. So I guess we're just trying to figure out kind of the sequential movement on occupancy here, which was strong in June, and then July feels like it's slowed down a little bit, maybe you're putting in some conservatism about Delta Variant, et cetera. Maybe just if you can unpack that a little bit?\nTimMcHugh: Thanks Nick. That's great question. And thinking about that relative to, you look at the second quarter, as you pointed out, June was a very strong month. What we've seen coming into July is actually very consistent. Indicators like leads and interest in all kinds of leading indicators that were strong in June, it continued in July. The biggest difference at this point, we'll get into July 4, Holiday was a very low moving week, which is not surprising to us looking at June. So up 40, we're a bit more than 40 relative or sorry, in July, we're a bit more than 40 month a day, at this point in July, we were mid 50s. So we called 10 plus basis points, the line kind of where we were in June. And we're 10 to 15 basis points ahead of where we were in April in May. So we're continuing to see this improvement on a trended basis. We're trying not to read too much into kind of micro trends. So I don't think July start really plays a role in our conservatism. I think you mentioned at the end, uncertainly around Delta variant, and they said a much inability necessarily forecast given still unprecedented nature of the backdrop, drive a little bit of our view and how we give the guidance there, but doesn't have as much to do with the start in July.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich from Green Street.\nLukasHartwich: Thanks. I have a question for John. I know you just joined the company. But I'm curious what your key priorities are out of the gate.\nJohnBurkart: Thank you. Yes, it's day 10. So my key priority is to seek first to understand aspect of things, very excited to be here. But those who know me know I don't give out my playbook. So definitely not doing that. But very excited to see a lot of opportunity. Amazing people here, Shankh is obviously amazing. And that's as much as I'm going to give you today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank.\nDerekJohnston: Good morning, everyone. Just back to the capital deployment front. Are you changing or getting creative with the mix specifically in Show? How are you viewing Independent Living versus assisted living opportunities? And how do the valuations vary in the private markets for each segment or versus replacement costs today. And of course, Wells appetite for each.\nShankhMitra: We're actually not changing the criteria; it is usually the replacement cost of assisted living for like for like, location is higher, sometimes significantly higher. But we always invest capital relative to what the replacement cost is, IRR targets are not different. I will tell you that we have a general propensity to go with a micro market with strong operators who have a stronghold on a product type. Going forward, as you think about I said this before, our portfolios has barbell approach, we want to be at a high price point high service areas, high service products in great barriers to high barriers to entry market, or we want to be on the lower sort of approachable end of lower price point, low service, right. That's kind of what our barbell approach is. And we have not changed that so there is a lot of creativity in the shop, but usually that's not around just a product selection that's around where you want to play in the capital structure high on the structure transaction that is not just one transaction and done.  For example, we like to build these growth vehicles that will continue to talk about this quarter we talked about Oakmont and aspect. But as you can see go back and look at five quarters ago or six quarters ago, we probably talked about Bremner organization. And you see, this quarter we started $100 million plus of MOB piece, right. So our job is not only to see, okay, where can we get that sort of the play, state of play right now, which is the devalue end of the play, but also create these growth vehicles that creates the interchanges that growth rate through the cycle, right. That's what we are focused on. And I'll be honest with you, Derek, I'm very, very proud of this team that has created I think this company will have unprecedented growth that will be unmatched in its history. And I think it is relatively understood the cyclical sort of bounce of that. But I think it is fairly misunderstood on what the cycle can look like. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky from Berenberg.\nConnorSiversky: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for having me. Great quarter. A bit of an abstract question, maybe. So operating under the assumption that the target demographic for seniors has a lot of net worth tied up in home equity. If we were to potentially see a blip in the housing market, as prices maybe come off peaks, could that translate into some kind of transitory impacts on rate or revPAR? Or do you think the demand environment currently is strong enough to offset that kind of dynamic? \nShankhMitra: If you believe that housing prices can come down 50%, which I think is how much it's up last few years, three to four years in many, many places, then yes, but also remember that you are talking about people who have bought their houses in the 80s and 90s, right, they're sitting on a significant amount of household sort of network, that should not impact. I will give you, go back and look at how assisted living has done senior housing in general has done in the -- during the global financial crisis, where you got a massive crash of housing prices, and see how the asset class has done. Just as a hint, I think that was senior housing was one of the best performing asset class through the global financial crisis through that housing bust. So that should give you some hint. I'm a student of history, every cycle is different. I'm not going to sit here and pontificate how much it might play out. But I will tell you that housing has an impact on many aspects of the economy. And it has a particular impact because senior housing is not an income place and assets play. And mostly it is housing type of an asset play, but remember, who is your customer? It's an 85 year old, and she's sitting on a house that probably she bought in 1988.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One.\nDanielBernstein: Good morning, I guess this one to see if we could drill down a little bit into the Canadian asset leading indicators. I mean that has trailed a little bit and your numbers would have been even better than get posted if Canada had been performed. So just wanted to see if we could drill down a little bit on what's going on with the tours, leads some of those leading indicators on the Canadian senior sales.\nShankhMitra: Okay, Dan, I mentioned this on my prepared remarks April, or May, we have seen that drag that you're talking about, really populated out in June, we've seen almost doubling up in person tours, et cetera in June, Canada, by and large opened up significantly in the beginning of July. So we are seeing that is starting to reflect and we expect that Canada will catch up, right. So sort of it's a drag today, but I would expect that you will see some significant sequential improvement in Canada. As we get through the rest of the year. Tim, you want to add anything on that?\nTimMcHugh: Yes, I've said in July, I've mentioned tours interest; we've seen actually tours and inquiries reach 2019 levels. So if we look at how the recovery occurred in the US, there was about a month lag and for between when we kind of saw that start to happen in February end of February when we started to see occupancy turn, not saying it'll follow the same pattern. But you've seen first kind of flattening of the decrease in occupancy. And then we've seen these leading indicators move. So we're certainly hopeful that we'll start to see those fundamentals turn here in the third quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session and today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now all disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I hope that all of you and families are safe and healthy. Before I make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing, and on capital allocation environment, I want to welcome John Burkart, our Chief Operating Officer to this call. John joined Welltower last week after illustrious 25 year career to Essex. We believe he will make a tremendous long-term impact on our platform. Following my remarks, as usual, Tim will walk you through our operating and financial results. We're cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business as occupancy is starting to build and we're encouraged by nearly 200 basis points of spot to spot occupancy growth in second quarter, which clearly exceeded our expectations. Momentum in US continued to be strong, with lead generation returning to pre COVID levels, resulting in a 280 basis points occupancy gain in the quarter and the UK remain resilient despite the rise in the Delta variant cases being driven by the younger cohorts. Though, we are monitoring the situation closely we have seen very little impact to the portfolio so far as UK case counts more broadly appear to be decreasing rapidly after recent spike. While Canada was a drag on occupancy, we are witnessing some green shoots following a material decline in COVID cases. In fact, tours almost doubled in June from April and May in Canada, as provinces have removed moving restrictions and are now permitting in person tours. For our overall portfolio, June was particularly impressive month with move in exceeding 2019 level for the first time since the beginning of pandemic. I'm also encouraged that our operators were able to achieve these occupancy gains, while holding rate reflecting the need based nature of our asset class, and strong value proposition of this business. Year-over-year same store revPAR is up 3.2% across our assisted living properties, 2.8% across our independent living properties, and 5.3% across our wellness housing communities. The strength in same store revPAR was primarily driven by our highest end luxury products in primary coastal markets. Having said that, I'll caution you that there is still significant uncertainty and many unknowns related to the path of COVID. And it is too early to signal an all clear. However, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making towards achieving the substantial embedded NOI growth in our Show portfolio. Last quarter, we provided details of nearly $0.5 billion of NOI upside, which assumes a return to fourth quarter 2019 occupancy and margin levels. We're pleased to report that we not only achieved $71 million towards this total goal in one quarter, but also added another $29 million potential upside through the second quarter of acquisition and development deliveries. Going forward, we'll still have another $430 million to NOI upside in that business. Again, this only assumes a return to pre COVID occupancy with potential upside from high rates and return to frictional vacancy, which is mid to high single digits. Turning to capital allocation, last fall when we have made a significant pivot from defense to offense, we made it explicit bet that consumers will return to this new trend business with 400 basis points of occupancy ramp in US from March trough with healthy rates, it appears that we're on the right side of that bet. Over the past three quarters we have deployed $4 billion of capital at extremely attractive pricing during a time when others were fearful. But we remain paranoid optimists and our humility and lack of complacency are pushing us to test our hypotheses, and underwrite everything we look at with conservatism. And you can rest assured that we look at pretty much everything in our space. Therefore, we are only willing to pay a price per unit that does not require everything to go right for our owners to make a reasonable return. The second quarter was one of the best quarters from a capital deployment perspective, having closed approximately $1.4 billion of growth investments. Q3 will likely top Q2, and we anticipate that it will be another record quarter of investment activity for the company. We started Q3 with a bang. And so far in July, we have already closed $230 million of gross investment and expect our previously disclosed Holiday transaction to close in third quarter as well. While it is fun to talk about large transactions like Holiday, which I'll get to in a minute, I want to point out that our core strategy and strength is granular transaction with a diverse group of operating partners, and is supported by our data analytics platform. Our COVID class, which I define as anything we bought is turning to offense in Q4 of last year, now exceeds $4 billion of gross investment activity, including Holiday, across 37 transactions with 24 unique partners. In the US, that would on average be $16.6 million per community, or $161,000 per unit, which we believe represents a significant discount to replacement costs. The pipeline remained very strong with many owners and operators eager to join our operator and data platform. Let me give you some examples. First, I'm very pleased to announce that we'll expand our relationship with John Moore and his team at Atria while Lilly and her team and Holiday will join our platform. We're buying 80 nearly identical Holiday Independent Living assets at more approachable end of senior living spectrum with an addition of six more combination AIL assets for a total consideration of $1.58 billion or $152,000 per unit. Our base remains compelling even after our anticipated investment of $1.5 million to $2 million of CapEx by community to bring them to tomorrow standard. While the lease up of this portfolio from the compelling basis through -- a double digit unlevered IRR, we believe there are few opportunities to enhance our return. Number one, our underwritten rent growth is 2.5% per year, despite a heavy investment in the portfolio that will improve asset quality and marketability. Our 2026 underwritten rent remains $700 to $800 below feasibility rent to make development pencil. Two, we have a significant expansion opportunity in 10 plus assets which we expect will generate a double digit return on invested capital; three, the optimization of six AIL buildings under Atria platform and four, there are at least five higher and better use opportunities and a couple of them are so significant that they may generate enough proceeds to pay for a significant portion of the CapEx investment for the whole portfolio. If we are successful in this effort, we will have a completely renovated portfolio at roughly out going in basis, which will enhance our IRR materially. Moving forward from Holiday, I like to make the operative specific comments on this call. First, while we continue to be encouraged by Jack Callison's at Sunrise. Jack is refocusing the organization as a premier Senior Living brand in North America. We are excited about this focus growth strategy and brought Sunrise in to run a recently acquired community in the Philadelphia metro area. This is our first acquisition initiative with Sunrise in several years, and believes we'll have many opportunities to grow together. In the UK Sunrise platform and portfolio will be acquired by Signature and Care UK Signature is an existing Welltower operating partner which runs our high fin communities in the UK. We're tremendously excited to welcome Care UK to our platform, which is one of the most well respected and largest Senior Living operators in the UK, with the addition of 81 on the value end and Care UK on the higher end along with our existing operating partners, the barbell approach to portfolio construction that we have taken in the US which is all an -- which we always aspired to be in the UK is beginning to take shape. We're very excited about Care UK technology and management platform. We're also thrilled to welcome Pathway Living to Welltower's operating platform, which we believe opens another avenue for growth for us. Next, I'm excited to announce our expanded partnership with Oakmont Management Group, which is one of our strongest and best operating partners. This expanded partnership with Courtney and her team is expected to result in a nearly doubling of our time portfolio together in California. We're also embarking on a long-term exclusive development program together to meaningfully expand our relationship in the next decade. Fun fact, Oakmont is our first operator in our portfolio to return to the 90% occupancy mark post COVID, a reflection of Oakmont's operating acumen and market strength. Finally, I'm excited to announce our new partnership with Chris Smith and his team at Aspect Health. We recap Aspect's existing MOB portfolio in Connecticut and at New York and entered into a long term Development Partnership with Chris. We believe a combination of our data and operating capabilities with Aspect's relationships, and development talent will create significant opportunities for growth for both companies. We're already on our first development together, which will be a 60,000 square feet outpatient medical building located at a very attractive market in the New York metropolitan area. The property will be master leased to a leading health system for 20 years and is expected to start construction early next year. Speaking of growth opportunities, I'm pleased to announce our continued growth with the Bremner organization. In the next, in the second quarter, our partnership closed on the first building of a large development near Norman, Oklahoma with Normal Retail Health System. The total development cost for phase one of this multi phase development is expected to be in excess of $100 million, consisting of 181,000 rentable square feet, a classy outpatient medical facilities. Our significant MOB development platform pipeline, which is 100% leased, is now in excess of 1 million square feet and will create significant value for our shareholders in a very tight acquisition market. All of these operating and development partnerships make us the foundation for our core belief that centralized capital allocation and decentralized execution releases entrepreneurial energy while keeping costs and politics at bay. We are very proud that we have formed 50 new operators and develop relationships since the beginning of pandemic. And we have a handful more in the works. The implication of our rapidly growing operator and development platform are vast, including a network effect, whereby addition of more operators creates exponentially recent data set, and thus stronger and attractive an analytics platform. This dramatically enhances the informational advantage we're already positive through our best-in-class with analytics platform, which forms the basis of our capital allocation decision. Needless to say, these relationships create foundation for significant capital deployment opportunities, as each one of them are attracted world vehicle on their own right. This Lollapalooza effect of intertwining operating and data platform has created a wide and increasingly deeper mode for Welltower. As Tim will speak to you in a moment, we're very pleased to with our progress to further strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity profile. More specifically, our sequential adjusted EBITDA growth of roughly $50 million indicates that we're on our way to deleverage organically as senior housing properties unfold. Overall, we're very happy with our execution so far in the year to create cost share value for our shareholders. We're cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment, and excited about our opportunities to acquire and develop talent, create new relationships, and attract quality partners, which will result outside internal and external growth for years to come. After retooling our assets and portfolio operators, and building a formidable predictive analytics platform and talent base, and growing with conviction following two negative cycles superimposed on each other, resulting from oversupply and COVID, I'm happy to say that we're emerging as a partner of choice, an employer of choice and an investor of choice on the other side of this pandemic. With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim? Thank you, Tim. I wanted to conclude by expanding on a team that I mentioned before, we're engaged in two small transactions with two other REITs our sector, that are not material to any company that involved. We are buying a handful of assets in one transaction and selling a handful of assets in other transaction. Those dollars involved are too small to be mentioned on this call, but I bring them up as I think they reflect a new era of collaboration amongst public REIT. Both of these transactions which will result in favorable outcomes for all of our respective shareholders on a transactional basis. But what's important to focus is an emerging theme amongst public REIT, the life doesn't have to be a zero sum game. With that the operator we will open it up for questions. Vikram, I'll try to take a stab at that. So did it surprise us? Yes, it did. If you think about last quarter call, I said despite all the noise of discounting another so when I said that our operators have a very special product and a very special value proposition that just they're not willing to discount. And but having said that, I didn't expect this kind of pricing strength yet. It was entirely driven by our highest end luxury product in coastal markets, as I said; do we expect it to continue? Yes, we do. In fact, we, as Tim pointed out in his prepared remarks; we expect that to accelerate into Q3. And so look, I mean, from the perspective of the stage is set by a very powerful recovery of margin and cash flow increase as we come through, but we're very, very excited about what's going on. And at the same time there's a lot of uncertainty, we're not in this for next quarter next month. This is a long term business. We're excited about what we're seeing. But most importantly, as Tim pointed out, we think that we're increasingly getting to a point that is really validating our belief that the business which is frankly, it was when we said this last year, around this time, that is validating our belief that the product is needed, and the consumers will be back and we're seeing that. Josh, thank you for that question. And our MOB pipeline, if you're asking about acquisition, that pipeline is zero. And if you're asking about development pipeline, it's actually a million plus square feet fully leased, 100% leased pipeline, we continue to believe that the pricing that we're seeing in MOB market doesn't make any sense of our long term perspective. So we remain out of the market. We did this transaction specifically, because we see a very significant growth opportunity with Chris and his team. And are we willing to partner with more sharp -- local sharp protests? Absolutely, yes. But it's purely on a transactional basis. We have not a lot of interest in that space right now. We think what we are seeing the opportunity to flood capital and make significant amount of return for our shareholders in the senior housing space is compelling. And that's where the capital deployment opportunities in the near term will be focused on. Mike, that's a very, very good question. Now you're asking me to speculate. So I will speculate, but it's speculation nonetheless but if you think about the occupancy as we get back, sort of to the more stabilized occupancy level, you just call it high 80%, I think you will see significant pricing power, even above what you have seen sort of these quarters or this particular quarter, let me remind you through the supply cycle, sort of call it from '15 to '19, when our occupancy has gone down, we have still raise rate about 4%, right, in face of a supply cycle, which I expect the setup is completely different. This cycle or this decade forward where you have better demand and probably in a better environment for supply as well. So is it -- should we see once stabilization happens, greater pricing power, we absolutely should. But it remains to be seen, as I will tell you one of the things that we interestingly watch, is that very tight correlation of housing price appreciation, and pricing power in senior housing industry. And we have seen a significant increase in a record household sort of wealth growth. And that hasn't really translated so far into senior housing pricing. We probably starting to see some of that this quarter, but it will come through. Thank you, Rich. That's a very, very good question. So we continue to believe as I said before, that you will see some supply but you will not see this cycle. We believe that supply will chase demand instead of demand chasing supply, like you've seen last decade if we see no supply, we have bigger issues, right, that says that we're the only people who actually see the business. Everybody else is missing, that's not how many is going to happen. But I wouldn't react to short term, high frequency data on these things. Because these data is obviously comes with a lot of errors and noises, the similar types of data that you have been supplied would have told you that occupancy for us for the quarter would be down with negative pricing, that clearly didn't happen.  So I wouldn't react too much to the high frequency data from one or two providers, I will tell you that forget about what others are doing. We are looking at a lot of development. And they're very, very hard to pencil; they are very hard to pencil, given feasibility rent remains between 20% and 30% below depending on different markets. And that just a question of how much rents have sort of cost has gone down, cost has gone up. And a high frequency indicator like lumber price on a Bloomberg screen doesn't tell you that it has changed significantly, you got to look at our long term average and people's ownership of that than sitting in the warehouse, and it hasn't shown up yet. Will it show up? Probably it will show up at some point. But that's it. At the same time, you're seeing a lot of other products, cost is going up, the country is significantly undersupplied on overall housing, and you will see housing starts will continue to go up with the demand of different materials.  So I think that a lot of lessons have been learned on the bank side, losing a lot of money in this space, a lot of equity has lost a lot of money, clearly, you can see why we're buying new products at significantly below replacement cost. And the gap between where we're buying, call it $0.60 on the dollar and the $1 if somebody lost a lot of money, right. And so it was obviously these lessons will be remembered in the near term as the demographic catch on. But we are very much aware of what you are saying this is why we're so focused on price per unit. And that's why I made the point I made during my prepared remarks that we're not willing to buy anything and everything, even if we think it's a decent deal. Because in many cases, a lot of these things as a long term investor in the space, a lot of these things need to go right over a period of time for us, our shareholders to make money. And that's not the kind of investment I do make. Thank you, Jonathan. So first, coverage came down for obvious reasons, right you are -- you're still remember the NOI has trough last quarter is still coming down right from an trailing four quarter basis is how you report coverages, which means the better quarters are getting out of numbers. And worst quarters are getting in the numbers due mostly speaking in a normalized in a stabilized environment, coverage should give you the state of the business at inflection points like this, where you've got sharp decrease and sharp increases, it will not give you the state of the business. There's just like our other offers that you're seeing in shop, part of the portfolio, the fundamentals have trough last quarter, and it's actually getting better. So for example, let's just talk about ProMedica. I don't want to get into this because frankly speaking for our investors, ProMedica overage is a huge element metric because as I told you before, that ProMedica rent is guaranteed by the health system, the mother ship at the top end, right. So it's really is irrelevant metric for our investors.  However, having said that let me make some observations about that topic. The revenue if you think about versus second quarter was the highest actually for ProMedica for that specific business for [Indiscernible] was the highest in last five quarters. They have seen significant increase sequential increase in occupancy, just this quarter, about 400 basis points in that skilled nursing business. And you know what is going on is there is Midlock as we and ProMedica in Midlock selling a bunch of asset, right? And those asset base is going through -- has a negative EBITDA as I talked about before when we announced the deal, and that still flowing to the number and creating significant noise on the number side. So that is absolutely is sort of going to create a lot of issues. And also on the same side, you were seeing, we add a nine Powerback building that is getting integrated. So you have a lot of noise. I will tell you, let's take a step back and think about what the business is trending. Business as I said, the second quarter revenue was the highest actually in last five orders. Business is getting better. ProMedica team, senior care team is doing exactly what we laid it out that they will happen, which is you're creating new partnership with different system, we announced it, they announced a new partnership MetroHealth in Cleveland, there's another one they signed a joint venture, which I'm not at the liberty naming name right at this point is a premier system in the country, business is moving forward.  But as far as wealth of our shareholders are concerned that rent is guaranteed by the mother ship, which obviously is a very significant system with two plus billion dollars of cash and material in a $7 billion of revenue. So I don't want to get into that conversation. Remember, at this point in Jonathan, just not just talking about ProMedica but any triple-net leases will not reflect the state of the business because of the fourth quarter trailing nature of how we report coverages. From a standpoint of your second question, I think Tim touched on it. I will still say again, we have told you before that we believe that our leases are backed by material amount of credit and assets that we own in joint ventures and other assets owned by the operators, we do not believe there will be significant disruption of earnings and cash flow coming out of that. And our belief, that statement is getting stronger and stronger every day. That's how much I'm willing to talk about any specific operator at this call. Thank you. Thank you, Juan. I completely agree with you. It's about what comes next. That's the point I was trying to make on the coverage metric, right. It's the state of what's happening now. And what's happening next, not what happened yesterday. Having said that, I'll tell you, it's important to understand when we talk about acquisition. Unlike many companies, we don't talk about what's under contract, unless it is a very large transaction that shareholders should know about. The holidays are a good example. So the $4 billion or so of COVID class is transaction that we have closed, we could have given you a significantly higher number of the transaction we have taken our hands on. So pipeline, I know you understand that. But I wanted to make a very concerted effort to make that point again, because it's very different from how most other companies report their numbers. So the pipeline, let's just talk about pipeline, which is where we have shaken hands, we have agreed on a transaction and it is going through the process. Well, it's the transactions take long time to close, as you know we're pretty quick, we are quicker than probably most other organizations that you will meet but we're also extremely thorough, right? So it takes time, we visit every property that we buy. So it takes time. So let's just talk about that pipeline, which we define as something that's under contract that's visible. That is significant, and it's under contract. So we feel very, very good about continued momentum on the acquisition side. Let's talk about the shadow pipeline, which I define as something that we're negotiating right now, that is also significant and visible. And I think you will see continued acquisitions at very, very favorable price. As I said before, going forward, as I've said before, we're driven by value of acquisition, not volume of it, right. So as long as we can create value will continue to occur. And if we see that market prices are moved to a place where doesn't make sense, we will not. And for it could be a lip service, but you can look at our history. And you will see that we have exactly done that. We have moved with market pricing, and if market pricing and got into a place where we think it doesn't make sense, we sold assets. So near term, we see tremendous amount of opportunities by this -- all this disruption in the market. And we're seeing tremendous opportunity, because there are several operators, and developers want to join our platform to access the data that we talked about for several quarters on this call. So sum it all together. I'm very, very optimistic about capital deployment opportunities, at very attractive price in coming quarters. Thank you, Jordan. Look, I mean, when we made last year this bet for example, I'll tell you this is exactly your one year mark, when we first have started this discussion with Oakmont how to grow this business significantly, as a partnership yesterday marked exactly one year. But the times were scary, right? I mean, there's no question about it, occupancy was falling, like a rock EBITDA obviously was going down materially given on the high operating leverage in the business. But we had unwavering belief that the product is needed and that consumers will return, right? That doesn't mean that we knew for sure that will happen. That's the bet we made. And that bet actually made sense on a risk adjusted basis. And we talked about that, over last four calls. And I am very pleased that we recognized that bet seems to be playing up. So how is it changing? Look, at the end of the day, if you -- you have to think about real estate is a game of basis, right? No matter how good the environment is, or how bad the environment is, there's a floor and ceiling of value depending on what it costs to build. So we are not going to say that it's all clear. Things are fantastic.  Let's just pay prices that are above replacement cost and acquire as much asset because we can't because we have a cost of capital. That is not how we run this place. Cost to just, we have a cost of capital; our owners have given us a cost of capital, our bondholders have given us the cost of capital so that we can accrue value to our owners. Not because we want to accrue value to the sellers. And that is how we have always run this place and that is how will always run this place. There is no dearth of opportunity, we're not significantly changing our underwriting and frankly speaking we are basis investor, an IRR investor. So you might say okay, you're long term in 10 year IRR or 15 year IRR really hasn't changed, has your near term growth rates have changed? Yes, it has. But that doesn't translate into higher prices, because we're still solving for the same IRR. And we're still really focused on what the price per unit price per foot is. Hopefully that helps you to get a glimpse of how we underwrite. We're actually not changing the criteria; it is usually the replacement cost of assisted living for like for like, location is higher, sometimes significantly higher. But we always invest capital relative to what the replacement cost is, IRR targets are not different. I will tell you that we have a general propensity to go with a micro market with strong operators who have a stronghold on a product type. Going forward, as you think about I said this before, our portfolios has barbell approach, we want to be at a high price point high service areas, high service products in great barriers to high barriers to entry market, or we want to be on the lower sort of approachable end of lower price point, low service, right. That's kind of what our barbell approach is. And we have not changed that so there is a lot of creativity in the shop, but usually that's not around just a product selection that's around where you want to play in the capital structure high on the structure transaction that is not just one transaction and done.  For example, we like to build these growth vehicles that will continue to talk about this quarter we talked about Oakmont and aspect. But as you can see go back and look at five quarters ago or six quarters ago, we probably talked about Bremner organization. And you see, this quarter we started $100 million plus of MOB piece, right. So our job is not only to see, okay, where can we get that sort of the play, state of play right now, which is the devalue end of the play, but also create these growth vehicles that creates the interchanges that growth rate through the cycle, right. That's what we are focused on. And I'll be honest with you, Derek, I'm very, very proud of this team that has created I think this company will have unprecedented growth that will be unmatched in its history. And I think it is relatively understood the cyclical sort of bounce of that. But I think it is fairly misunderstood on what the cycle can look like. If you believe that housing prices can come down 50%, which I think is how much it's up last few years, three to four years in many, many places, then yes, but also remember that you are talking about people who have bought their houses in the 80s and 90s, right, they're sitting on a significant amount of household sort of network, that should not impact. I will give you, go back and look at how assisted living has done senior housing in general has done in the -- during the global financial crisis, where you got a massive crash of housing prices, and see how the asset class has done. Just as a hint, I think that was senior housing was one of the best performing asset class through the global financial crisis through that housing bust. So that should give you some hint. I'm a student of history, every cycle is different. I'm not going to sit here and pontificate how much it might play out. But I will tell you that housing has an impact on many aspects of the economy. And it has a particular impact because senior housing is not an income place and assets play. And mostly it is housing type of an asset play, but remember, who is your customer? It's an 85 year old, and she's sitting on a house that probably she bought in 1988. Okay, Dan, I mentioned this on my prepared remarks April, or May, we have seen that drag that you're talking about, really populated out in June, we've seen almost doubling up in person tours, et cetera in June, Canada, by and large opened up significantly in the beginning of July. So we are seeing that is starting to reflect and we expect that Canada will catch up, right. So sort of it's a drag today, but I would expect that you will see some significant sequential improvement in Canada. As we get through the rest of the year. Tim, you want to add anything on that?"

            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, balance sheet liquidity and update in addition to our outlook for the third quarter. The time of our last earnings call on April 29, we were six weeks into an occupancy recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, which has seen total portfolio occupancy increased 67 basis points on March 12 lows or an average increase of 11 basis points per week. In the 13 weeks that have followed, we've seen the occupancy recovery accelerate, adding an additional 204 basis points through July 23, an average pace of 16 basis points per week, bringing the portfolio wide occupancy recovery since March 12 to 271 basis points. The recovery continues to be uneven across the portfolio, with the US leading in 401 basis points since March 12, followed by the UK at 275 basis points. And lastly, Canada, which has seen a net decrease of 88 basis points over this time period. We believe these geographic discrepancies will normalize over time as the reopening of both Canada and the UK catches up to the US. Looking forward despite the uncertainty around the path of COVID in the near term, particularly the spread of the new variants, we continue to both gain evidence that the vaccines are exceptionally effective at protecting our residents and staff from this evolving virus and gain confidence with the permanent demand impairment thesis that surrounded the senior housing asset class in much of the last year and a half to becoming significantly less probable. Now turning to the quarter; Welltower reported net income attributed to common stockholders of $0.06 per diluted share, and normalized FFO of $0.79 per diluted share. First initial guidance of $0.72 to $0.77 per share, and our June guidance update of $0.75 to $0.79 per share, which included a $5 million benefit from HHS Provider Relief Funds. We ultimately recognize that $5 million benefit from HHS Funds and also recognize an additional $4.9 million a reimbursement payments for similar programs in Canada and the UK. After adjusting for the impact of these funds, our normalized FFO per diluted share in the quarter is $0.77. Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported one quarter in years. These statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 3/31/2021. Importantly, our collection rates remain high in the second quarter, having collected 95% of triple-net contractual rent during the period. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio same store NOI declined 2.7% year-over-year, as leases that were moved to cash recognition in prior quarters continued to comp against prior year full contractual rent received. And trailing 12 months EBITDA coverage was 0.89x. As I've stated in the past, the timing and scope for the recovery in our senior housing portfolio will dictate whether or not disruption from COVID to underlying fundamentals generates a short term liquidity issue or solvency problem for triple-net operators. Over the first four months of recovery, we've observed occupancy and EBITDA trends within this portfolio that are in line with our US and UK operating portfolios. As these recovery trends strengthen the solvency risk for operators has decreased in tandem. In our continued strong cash rent collection in the quarter is the best evidence we have this.  The value of the collateral that sits behind many of our lease agreements continue to allow us to work with our operators to enhance near term liquidity without impairing the value of Welltower of real estate position. Next, our long term post acute portfolio generating negative 1.1% year-over-year same store growth and trailing 12 months EBITDA coverage was 1.29x. In the quarter, we transition 40 of the 51 plan Genesis transition assets to new operators, including nine power back assets transition to ProMedica. With the remaining 11 schedule to transition in the third quarter. 35 of these assets are expected to be disposed out the third quarter. With the expected third quarter Genesis dispositions and the $75 million sales in Altech portfolio in the quarter. Welltower's percentage placed NOI generates long term post acute segment will be reduced to 5.6%. And Genesis Healthcare will represent less than 90 basis points of total company in place NOI. And lastly, health systems, which are comprised by ProMedica Senior, care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. At same store NOI growth of positive 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12 EBITDA coverage was 1.25x. Turning to medical office; our outpatient medical segment delivered 2.2% year-over-year same store growth due to improved platform profitability and increased property level expense recovery. Occupancy in our same store portfolio ended the quarter at 94.8%, a 20 basis points sequential increase versus first quarter. The strong growth is driven by executed new leasing totaling 178,000 square feet, the highest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019 and supported by 94% retention in the quarter. That's consistent renewal activity was paired with reduced vacancies. Also during the quarter we delivered one purpose built medical office building at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. While the two recently converted Stanley MOB in Charlotte with Atrium Health. These building sold 449,000 square feet of fully occupied space with highly credited health systems. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio, before getting into this quarter's results, I want to provide some color on the recently announced transfer of the Sunrise UK operating platform to two local operators, Signature Senior Lifestyle and Care UK. We're excited to take this opportunity to deepen our local operator relationships. The Sunrise UK portfolio consists of 46 predominantly private pay properties located primarily in southern New England, the portfolio is being split largely by geographic focus. The property is located in Greater London moving to Signature, a premium operator with its Welltower had a relationship since 2012. And the rest of the properties moving the Care UK, a new member of the Welltower operating family and the fourth largest independent care home operate in the UK with the focus on the private pay market. Turning to government grants. In the quarter, we received approximately $5 million from Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act Provider Relief Fund. As we've done in past quarters, these funds are recognized on a cash basis and as such will go through financials the quarter they're received. We're normalizing HHS Funds out of our same store metrics however; along with any other government funds received they're not matching expenses incurred in the period they're received. In the second quarter, there are approximately $9.3 million of reimbursements normalized out of our same store senior housing operating results. Now turning to results for the quarter. Year-over-year same store NOI decreased 17.6% as compared to 2Q 2020 driven by a 670 basis point decrease in year-over-year average occupancy. The COVID related decline in occupancy that began in March of 2020 came to a halt in mid March of this year, and portfolio wide occupancy increased by approximately 230 basis points from March 12 to the end of June. With a 190 basis points taking place in the second quarter. The Stanley occupancy recovery and the accompanying operating market expansion have created an inflection point for bottom line results. And sequential same store NOI increased 11.2% in the first to the second quarter. Sequential same store revenue was up 1.8% in Q2, driven primarily by 40 basis point increase in average occupancy and sequential monthly revPAR increase of 1.3%. With respect to expenses, total same store expenses decreased 40 basis points sequentially, and declined 2.9% year-over-year. I'll focus on the sequential change since this is more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 40 basis point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower COVID costs, as case counts remain near zero for all the second quarter after spiking meaningfully in the first quarter. Costs were also driven lower sequentially by seasonal utility costs, as a spring and early summer have lower utility costs relative to Q1. The net result is a resilient rental rates and rebounding occupancy combined with a decrease in total expenses, with a sequential margin improvement in our same store pool of 180 basis points to 21.2%. Looking forward to the third quarter, starting with July quarter to date data we've already observed. We've experienced a 40 basis point increase in occupancy through July 23. With the US and UK up 60 and 30 basis points respectively while Canada is flat. Despite the strength of recovery so far, particularly in the US, we remain cautious not projecting the acceleration in trends from the second quarter to the third quarter, given the continued lack of historical precedents with which to forecast and also uncertainty around COVID variant. Despite seeing promising resilience in our UK portfolio over the last month, as a surge in the Delta variant infections amongst the general population has not been echoed amongst our resident population. There remains uncertainty, particularly around how national and local authorities may react in the coming months. If the surge continues or accelerate in our other geographies. On a spot basis, we're currently projecting an approximate 190 basis point increase in occupancy from June 30 through September 30. We expect revPAR to be up 1% to 1.5% up sequentially and up 2.5% year-over-year. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be up 1.5% to 2% sequentially driven by a combination of occupancy driven labor utilization and seasonal utility costs, offset slightly by continued declines in COVID costs. The net result in sequential changes will be expected flow through margins in the mid 60s, inclusive of the seasonal utility increase and mid 70s normalizing for the seasonality of utility costs.  Turning to capital market activity. In June, we expanded our existing unsecured credit facility to $4.7 billion after closing on a $4 billion unsecured revolving line of credit which replaced our previous $3 billion revolver. Revolving facility bears interest and LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points representing a five basis point improvement from pricing under our previous revolver. The facility was supported by 31 incumbent and new banks and highlights the incredible support of our banking partners. On June 28, we completed the issuance of $500 million for senior unsecured notes due January 2029. Bearing interest at 2.05%. Proceeds from the offering were used to pay down borrowings in our revolving line of credit, and to pay down the remaining balance of our COVID term loan put in place in April of 2020. Additionally, in the quarter, we extinguish $674 million of senior unsecured notes due 2023 using proceeds for March 25, 2021 bond issuance, improving our weighted average maturity across senior unsecured notes to 8.2 years. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to efficiently capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. By utilizing our ATM program to fund those near term transactions, having sold 20.1 million shares to just beginning of the second quarter via forward sale agreement and the initial weighted average price of approximately $80 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.6 billion. Since the beginning of the year, we've sold a total of 22.3 million shares of common stock via forwards sale agreements which are expected to generate a total of $1.8 billion in proceeds of which 5 million shares were settled during the second quarter, resulting in $372 million in gross proceeds. And capital deployment opportunities continue to materialize. We'll look to fund those opportunities while maintaining ample liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. We ended the second quarter 6.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, 6.88x when adjusting out $5 million of HHS Funds received in the quarter. This HHS is adjusted in 2Q '21 leverage number represents a 0.25x decline from the prior quarter's 7.13x debt to EBITDA adjusted for HHS. Last quarter, I highlighted the impact of the recovery in senior housing fundamentals would have underlying EBITDA and cash flow based leverage metrics. We are encouraged to see this trend take shape as a 15% sequential improvement in EBITDA contribution from senior housing operating grow the entirety of the HHS adjusted improvement and debt to EBITDA. The total portfolio in occupancy sitting at 74.6% at quarter end, 12.6% below pre COVID levels and approximately 16.6% below peak levels achieved prior to last decade supply wave. We believe the stage is set for powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside is a couple of margin expansion of a very depressed base. Lastly, moving to our third quarter outlook; last night we provide an outlook for the third quarter of net income attributed common stockholders per diluted share of $0.44 to $0.49 and normalize FFO per diluted share of $0.78 to $0.83. This guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS Funds or similar government programs in the UK and Canada. So in comparing it sequentially to our second quarter normalized FFO per share, it'd be better to use the as adjusted $0.77 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes data period benefits of both programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our third quarter guidance $0.885 per share represents a $0.035 sequential increase from 2Q. The $0.035 increases comprised of a $0.03 per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs. A $0.02 per share increase from strong net investment activity highlighted by the expected closing of the Holiday Senior Living portfolio during the third quarter, result in dilution from dispositions relating to our previously communicated reduction exposure to Genesis. And $0.05 increased NOI from recently converted development mainly two fully leased MOBs in Charlotte, North Carolina and Brooklyn. These increases are offset by $0.01 per share increase in sequential G&A driven mainly by new hires, and $0.01 dilution from share settled in the second quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Shankh. That's correct, Amanda. The right way to think about is using about 1Q and 2Q. And the first quarter, because of the decline in occupancy, we saw that lasted for two and a half months of the quarter, we actually finished for spot occupancy was below average occupancy in 1Q, we have the opposite effect in 2Q where the increase typically in June has driven spot occupancy above average for the second quarter. So thinking about our spot occupancy, guidance to 190 basis points on kind of a spot basis and equates to 210 basis points on an average change from 2Q to 3Q. Yes, Steve, it certainly differs across operators. I'd say as far as the question around, hang up and move ins, the effectiveness of the vaccine and the lack of cases we've seen in the buildings across all three of our geographies, this point is really prompt the marketing around the operator policies. That being said, a large majority of our employees, the property level are vaccinated along with 90%, upper 90% of our residents. So the highly vaccinated at a facility environment across the board. Hi, Nick. Good question. We have not seen significant changes at state level restrictions and my comments in my script promote towards kind of the uncertainty around that going forward, there's obviously a lot of noise around kind of where things may change and where they've been the last, the most recent months. And the operator front our operators never, you think about sort of like a mask mandate, our operators never left the mask mandate. So you think about just the general facility and the way that they've been being run, there has not and likely will not be much of a change, depending on obviously the path of the virus, but to kind of what's going on in the general public last few months, because the operators continue to run a very safe, stringent environment when it comes to COVID. Thanks Nick. That's great question. And thinking about that relative to, you look at the second quarter, as you pointed out, June was a very strong month. What we've seen coming into July is actually very consistent. Indicators like leads and interest in all kinds of leading indicators that were strong in June, it continued in July. The biggest difference at this point, we'll get into July 4, Holiday was a very low moving week, which is not surprising to us looking at June. So up 40, we're a bit more than 40 relative or sorry, in July, we're a bit more than 40 month a day, at this point in July, we were mid 50s. So we called 10 plus basis points, the line kind of where we were in June. And we're 10 to 15 basis points ahead of where we were in April in May. So we're continuing to see this improvement on a trended basis. We're trying not to read too much into kind of micro trends. So I don't think July start really plays a role in our conservatism. I think you mentioned at the end, uncertainly around Delta variant, and they said a much inability necessarily forecast given still unprecedented nature of the backdrop, drive a little bit of our view and how we give the guidance there, but doesn't have as much to do with the start in July. Yes, I've said in July, I've mentioned tours interest; we've seen actually tours and inquiries reach 2019 levels. So if we look at how the recovery occurred in the US, there was about a month lag and for between when we kind of saw that start to happen in February end of February when we started to see occupancy turn, not saying it'll follow the same pattern. But you've seen first kind of flattening of the decrease in occupancy. And then we've seen these leading indicators move. So we're certainly hopeful that we'll start to see those fundamentals turn here in the third quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Welltower Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce General Counsel, Matt McQueen.\nMatt McQueen: Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh?\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. I'll make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing business, our ongoing alignment efforts with our operating partners, and we will also provide a detailed perspective on our current thoughts related to capital allocation. Tim will then get into detailed operating and financial results. We are cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business with greenshoots emerging in U.S. and U.K. While it is too early to raise an all fear flag as another COVID resurgence can never be ruled out, we're delighted to report an occupancy increase of 120 bps in U.K. and 90 bps in U.S. over the past six weeks. Despite growing optimism in U.S. and U.K., performance in Canada has remained somewhat weak due to increased COVID cases across many regions. While most residents within our Canadian senior housing properties have been vaccinated, the rollout to the broader population has lagged meaningfully due to lockdown in certain areas within Ontario and Quebec, move in stores and visitation have been highly restricted, which has ultimately led to an occupancy loss of 50 basis points since mid-March. This trend has improved in April. Despite the drag from Canada, the move in activity in March is higher than the last non-COVID impacted month of February of 2020. In addition, as I have described in past quarters, rates continue to hold. As adjusted for 2020 leap year, AL rates are up 1.6%, IL rates are up 0.7%, mostly dragged down by the Canadian business. Senior apartments and wellness housing rates are up 6.3%. Our operators across the board are seeing broad momentum that continued to build, irrespective type, geography, activity, this is the most optimistic tone I've heard from our operating partners in a long time. We're even seeing the lifestyle-driven customers are starting to come back, which frankly surprised me in a positive way. Fundamental results have exceeded our expectations in Q1, and we're anticipating strong momentum in Q2. While we continue to avoid speculation on what the arc of the recovery may look like, we have provided additional disclosure on the additional LOI and earnings power of our portfolio assuming a return to 2019 level of NOI for our stable portfolio and adding incremental NOI from our filler portfolio. We believe this results in additional $480 million of NOI. And remember, this assumes a return to 2019 level of occupancy and margin, and it does not assume a return to frictional vacancy or any rate growth since Q4 of 2019. We're seeing something similar happening in the private market. While current cash flow multiples of what we are buying might be high as compared to what we're willing to pay two to three years ago, this is a moot point. We're paying a much lower multiple and a stabilized cash flow as evidenced by a much lower price per unit. While in most other asset classes, this could be a matter of opinion, I believe in real estate it is a simple business where you can obtain a very granular view of price per unit and how this compares to replacement cost. While we can sit here and debate how different assets and portfolio prices compared to prices per unit two to three years ago, replacement costs are shooting upwards with a white-hot housing market driving construction costs exponentially higher in recent quarters. This phenomena is now spilling into other material costs due to a $2 trillion infrastructure plan announced by the Biden administration. As costs continue to rise, the market-clearing rent to achieve minimum acceptable return is also ratcheting up. However, those returns are not going to be easy to achieve. Today, as much of the senior housing industry effectively remains a lease-up mode, given the impact of COVID on occupancy. If this was not enough, now the interest rate curve is backing up, creating further pressure on developers pro forma. This backdrop clearly is unique to the current cycle, which we believe will result in meaningfully lower new starts in near to medium term. The supply outlook, along with already rising demographic growth in the first half of the decade gives us confidence that we'll achieve the level of asset performance that we provided. Although I have nothing to add in terms of the timing and/or the trajectory of the recovery, our analysis was done one asset at a time, and I hope you will find this new disclosure useful. During the first quarter, we continued our effort to create greater alignment of interest with our operating partners by restructuring several relationship constructs. And as we mentioned on our last call, we have made structural changes to several senior housing agreements. I would also like to highlight some recently announced strategic transactions with Genesis and ProMedica, with elements of both deals reflects our approach to value creation for our shareholders. First, Genesis. As we announced last month, after 10 years, we have substantially exited our Genesis real estate relationship through a series of transactions, which meaningfully derisked our cash flow stream going forward. Effectuating this nearly $900 million a transaction wasn't easy. It involved a skilled nursing operator deeply impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, the transitional access to local and regional operators working through our outstanding loans to Genesis, at the same time, creating opportunity for Welltower to participate in the post-COVID recovery in post acute fundamentals. Ultimately, we executed a mutually beneficial transaction for Genesis and Welltower shareholders. For Genesis, the transaction resulted in a meaningful deleveraging of its balance sheet, which will help you to reposition the company post-COVID-19. And for Welltower, we're able to execute the transaction at a par bid value of $144,000 and generated an 8.5% unlevered return over the full term of Genesis relationship. And upon the repayment of the outstanding debt, that return will rise to 9% with even further upside potential from participating preferred and the equity position. We believe that this represents a very favorable outcome for the shareholders, Welltower shareholders, particularly in light of the challenging environment that we have faced in the post-acute sector and then COVID-related pandemic-induced downside we have seen. While transactions will result in some near-term earnings dilution for Welltower, we expect to create significant value for our shareholders following the deployment of the $745 million of anticipated proceeds over a range of high-quality opportunity that I'll discuss shortly. Since our announcement last month, Genesis has received an infusion of equity capital and named a specialist in Harry Wilson as CEO. We wish the team of Genesis much success in the future as we have substantially exited a challenging legacy structure with Genesis, I hope our shareholders appreciate the favorable ultimate outcome. As we have done with several operating relationship over the last few years and discussed on various calls, our team embraced complexity, fixed creative solutions, doesn't run away from their problems and situations where the choices may be imperfect and ultimately work tirelessly to fulfill our commitment to our owners, operating partners, and employees. Second, ProMedica. We announced two transactions to strengthen and expand our relationship with ProMedica, which will enhance the quality of our joint venture position and continued growth. The first transaction involved $265 million sale of 25 skilled nursing assets with an average age of 41 years, which will result in an immediate improvement to the quality of the portfolio. At the same time, we also crystallized a 22% unlevered IRR over two and a half years of ownership of the asset, which is a true reflection of the power of our value-oriented investment philosophy. We at Welltower firmly believe that basis not yield or cap rates determine investment success. Through a separate transaction, we are pleased to maintain an 80% stake in our state-of-the-art assets which has been contributed to our 80/20 joint venture with ProMedica. ProMedica has already assumed the operations of these assets, which have been rebranded as ProMedica Senior Care. This successful transaction is yet another example of our focus on improving quality and growth profile of our portfolio while doing so at favorable economic terms to all stakeholders. ProMedica team is making progress in developing new relationship with other health systems as a provider of choice as Promedica represents the premium not-for-profit provider at the leading age of healthcare evolution. We're hopeful that we'll be able to deploy far-direct creative capital with this innovative partner of ours. Speaking of accretive capital deployment, we are pleased to share with you that we have closed in excess of $1.3 billion of acquisitions year to date with very attractive unlevered IRR, in particular, extremely happy to announce that we have partnered with a Safanad led investment group to recapitalize HC-One, the largest and most reputable operator of care homes communities in U.K. Our investment in excess of $800 million comes in form of first mortgage debt on HC-One's real estate and equity in recapitalization. We also received significant warrants that would further allow us to participate in the post-COVID upside that we are confident that management in process of executing. HC-One will add a value option to our high-end focused U.K. platform. There is significant opportunity to upgrade the asset base, operating platform and people in this portfolio, and we have tremendous confidence in James and David to fulfill their mission to deliver the highest quality care, along with the residents and employee satisfaction. In recent weeks, HC-One has experienced the same positive occupancy momentum as our broader U.K. portfolio, gaining 90 bps of occupancy from the March 2021 trough. Our debt investment represents the last found exposure of just $40,000 far unit and important statistic given our unrelenting focus on basis. This basis also represents a significant discount to replacement costs, in addition to the upside from equity and warrants. We think this is an extraordinary risk-adjusted return story. We believe we'll be able to generate low to mid-teens on IRR from this transaction while adding a highly strategic partner to fill a gap that we have in our portfolio in the U.K. With acquisitions, patience is a virtue and so is occasional boldness. Since we mentioned in our October call, the moment of boldness is here, we have closed in excess of $1.8 billion of acquisitions. The initial yield of this whole tranche is 6.8%, but we expect it will stabilize at a significantly higher number. When while the environment was very uncertain then, and we didn't give into institutional imperative about headline pressures, and we relied on independent thinking and resilience of our team. We remain very bullish on acquisition opportunities and have several attractive deals under contract currently and a highly visible pipeline, which we think we'll be able to execute through year end. While our focus continues to be on the right asset with the right basis and with the right operator, I'm hopeful that our 2021 class of acquisition will be immediately accretive to 2022 earnings and will be significantly accretive to 2023 and beyond. Lastly, I will address a very interesting question I have received from an investor post our last call. I was asked why we have such an emphasis on partner selection and whether it would be better off vertically integrating. We think this is an excellent question that deserves some reflecting for a moment. Notwithstanding the RIDEA law in senior housing, we believe we're better off in the ecosystem of partners and implementing an industrial view of vertical integration. That view is rooted in our belief that the combination of centralized capital allocation and decentralized execution creates the best long-term return. We believe this strategy of decentralized execution relates to energy and keeps politics and costs at bay. This is especially important in real estate, which is profoundly a local business. However, overall, we are happy with our execution so far in the year to create partial value for our shareholders, but by no means we are satisfied. We are cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment and excited about our opportunity to acquire assets, create new relationships, and attract quality challenges. With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim?\nTimothy McHugh: Thank you, Shank. My comments today will focus on our first-quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update, in addition to an outlook for the second quarter. After a year defined by infection protocols, move-in restrictions, and incredible operating challenges for our partners, we started 2021 in arguably the most challenging environment yet. With case counts hitting new highs across all three of our geographies and operating restrictions moving up in lockstep. Towards the end of February, the vaccine rollout hit its stride and nearly 80% of our facilities had their second vaccine finished. Case counts across the portfolio dropped precipitously, and we started to see the early signs of stabilization. The effectiveness and rapid deployment of vaccines within our communities are just starting to be felt across our resident population. And while we are encouraged by the last 6 weeks of recovery in the U.S. and U.K., significant uncertainty remains with respect to the prevalence of the virus among the general population, the timing of the reopening of the economy, and the timing of further rollbacks of operating restrictions, especially with respect to our Canadian portfolio. The result is a near-term operating environment that, although notably improved, remains highly unpredictable in the short term. As a result of this uncertainty, like last quarter, we provided a one-quarter outlook with our results last night. As we have done over the past 14-plus months, we will continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis with the intention of providing a more complete outlook as soon as the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for more reliable forecasting. Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.17 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share versus guidance of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. When providing guidance last quarter, we also provided expectations for $31 million of HHS provider relief funds we received in the quarter. We ended up recognizing approximately $34.7 million of HHS funds, along with $2.5 million of out-of-period payments for similar programs in Canada. Removing the impact of these funds, along with the $3.5 million termination fee that was received in one of our senior housing management company investments, which was not contemplating guidance, our normalized FFO moves to $0.70 per share. Therefore, on an apples-to-apples basis, we came out $0.01 above the top end of our HHS adjusted prior guidance of $0.64 to $0.69 per share. Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported one quarter in years. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2020. Importantly, our collection rate for rent remained high in the first quarter, having collected 96% of triple net contractual rent due in the period. Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio. Same-store decline 2% year over year as leases that we moved the cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against the prior year full contractual rent received. EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01 times on a sequential basis in the portfolio to 1.00. During the quarter, we transitioned the remaining five capital senior assets, moving one to triple-net structure under a new operator and the other four to various structure with CSU until transition. We also completed the transition of four properties leased by Hearth management to Storypoint under a new lease agreement. These transitions had a net positive impact of 0.02 times in total portfolio coverage. Next, our long-term post-new portfolio generated positive 0.2% year-over-year same-store growth, and EBITDAR coverage increased 0.37 times sequentially to 1.37 times. As 51 of the 79 Genesis assets began operator transitions. 23 assets have already transitioned as of this call, including nine former Powerback properties, which moved to ProMedica Senior Care. Pro forma for the already-completed ProMedica JV, Genesis Healthcare represents less than 90 basis points of our total in-place NOI. And long-term post-acute will be reduced to 6% of total NOI. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised by ProMedica Senior care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.8% year over year and trailing 12 EBITDAR coverage was 1.9 times. Before turning to outpatient medical, I want to highlight a disclosure change we made to our presentation of occupancy in our supplemental disclosure. Historically, we reported occupancy to 100% ownership. But going forward, we will present both at Welltower's pro-rata share to better reflect Welltower's ownership economics. This has no impact on NOI, which has always been presented at Welltower share. We have footnoted the occupancy levels if presented a 100% ownership in both the senior housing operating and medical office portion of our supplement. Now turning to our outpatient medical portfolio, which delivered positive 3.1% year-over-year same-store growth, as cash rent growth and higher platform profitability combined to producing acceleration in NOI growth. Tenant retention continued to be strong at 87.7% in the quarter, as we executed renewals on more than 540,000 square feet of space in the quarter, our highest amount ever reported. Additionally, we've also seen the length of term on executed renewal increases compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we completed our second joint venture with Invesco Real Estate for a portfolio of outpatient medical assets and completed our first with Wafra. Our ability to form joint ventures with best-in-class capital partners over the last two years has allowed us to maintain scale and more importantly, the tenant relationships generated from our in-house asset management platform. At the same time, we diversified our access to capital during a period of significant capital market turbulence. We look forward to growing these relationships further going forward. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to point out that we received approximately $35 million from our Department of Health and Human Services Cares Act provider relief fund. As we've done in the past quarters, the funds are recognized on a cash basis, and as such, will flow through financials in the quarter they are received. We're normalizing these HHS funds out of same-store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received they're not matched expenses occur in the period they received. In the first quarter, there were approximately $33.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied to the HHS program in the U.S. Now turning to results for the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 44% as compared to first-quarter 2020 and decreased 15.6% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Sequential same-store revenue was down 3.6% in Q1, driven primarily by a 310 basis point drop in average occupancy versus our guidance midpoint of 325 basis points. Turning to REVPOR in the quarter. Show portfolio REVPOR was down 1.5% year over year, but mix shift and an extra day of rent in the comparable leap-year quarter are distorting the true picture of rent growth metrics as over 40% of our revenue is derived on a per name basis. When adjusting for the leap year, total portfolio REVPOR growth moves to negative 1%. And breaking out our individual segments, our active adult independent living and assisted living segments reported year-over-year growth of positive 6.3%, positive 0.7%, and positive 1.6%, respectively. As I mentioned in the past few quarters, the combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by a considerable change in the composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio. Our lower acuity properties comprised of independent living and senior departments held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID, which has the mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity and therefore, lower rent-paying units. Rental rates are proving resilient, more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics. Lastly, expenses. Total same-store expenses declined 2.6% year over year and decreased 20 basis points sequentially. I'll focus on sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 20-basis-point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower COVID cover cost as case counts dropped dramatically in March. The meaningful decline in our top line, combined with these expense pressures had a significant impact to our operating margins, which declined 280 basis points sequentially to 19.4%. As I noted earlier in the call, we did not include government reimbursement that was not tied to parity expenses. And therefore, COVID expenses negatively impacted same-store by $14.8 million. We are not factoring any HHS funds into our second-quarter outlook. Looking forward to the second quarter, and starting with the April quarter-to-date data we've already observed, we've experienced 20 basis points through April 23, with the U.S., U.K. up 40 and 90 basis points, respectively, while Canada is down 20 basis points. While we are encouraged by the recovery in the U.S. and U.K. and are hopeful that the effectiveness of the vaccines has put a floor underneath operating results, we remain cautious on projecting an acceleration in recent trends, given the lack of historical precedents and uncertainty of reopening trend, particularly in Canada. On a spot basis, we are currently projecting a 130-basis-point increase in occupancy from March 31 through June 30. We expect monthly REVPOR to be plus 1.2% sequentially, although adjusting for the extra day in 2Q versus 1Q reduced to plus 70 basis points sequentially. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat. As increases in operating costs from higher occupancy should be offset by a reduction in COVID-related expenses. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to execute on our strategy of maximizing balance sheet stability. We're maintaining flexibility to position us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities. In March, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes due June 2031, bearing an interest rate of 2.8%, and used these proceeds to redeem all remaining senior unsecured notes due 2023. As a result, we were able to extend all senior unsecured debt maturities to 2024 and beyond, extend our weighted average maturity profile for nearly eight years. We also extinguished $42 million of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 7.6% in the quarter. In February, we highlighted a robust pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. As these transactions materialize, and the pipeline has grown, we've utilized our forward ATM program, selling 3.7 million shares of common stock to date at an initial average weighted price of $73.43 per share. These shares will generate future gross proceeds of approximately $272 million, and along with $1 billion of cash from our balance sheet, will enable us to officially capitalize our highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. Moving on to leverage. We ended the quarter at 6.59 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 31 basis point increase over the previous quarter as underlying cash flows continue to be pressured by the impact of COVID. While transactions closed in the second quarter will result in a slight increase in leverage, after adjusting for expected proceeds from assets held for sale and $272 million proceeds from the forward sale of common stock, we expect leverage to settle in the high sixes before the ramp in senior housing cash flows begin to naturally drive leverage lower in the coming quarters. Speaking of recovery, Shankh spoke earlier about the magnitude of potential cash flow growth from just returning to pre-COVID levels of margins and occupancy in our senior housing operating portfolio. This will have a significantly positive impact on cash flow-based leverage metrics. And although the duration of this recovery remains highly uncertain, the inflection point this quarterly is optimistic that it has begun. And our demonstrated ability to access significant equity proceeds through asset sales, even in the most difficult times, along with our return the equity market since last quarter, leaves us confident that we'll be able to keep the balance sheet in a position of strength as a natural deleveraging when the senior housing recovery returns us to well within our historical target levels in the not-too-distant future. Lastly, moving to our second-quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.31 to $0.36. And normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.72 to $0.77 per share. As I noted earlier, this guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS funds or similar government programs in the U.K. and Canada. So when comparing sequentially to our first quarter normalized FFO per share, use a $0.70 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes the benefits of these programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our second-quarter guidance of $0.745 per share represents a $0.045 sequential increase from 1Q. The $0.045 increase is composed of a $0.02 increase per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs, a $0.025 per share increase in net investment activity as strong post quarter investments is offsetting the initial dilution from loan reductions and operator transitions related to Genesis. A $0.01 increase in NOI from triple-net and outpatient medical segments, and this is offset by the expected $0.01 increase in sequential G&A, driven mainly by new hires. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic on our business, we have remained resolute in our commitment to ESG initiatives. In fact, our efforts on this front have only grown over the past year, and we are pleased to report significant progress, not just in terms of numerous awards and accolades we have received, but also by our action to strengthen and expand our ESG platform, which we believe will bear fruit in many years to come. We have recently received the Energy Star Partner of the Year award for the third consecutive year and elevated to the level of sustained excellence, the EPA's highest recognition within the Energy Star program. We have also been honored that our social initiatives we are recognized with the quality score of one by IFF, the highest ranking in the social category. And last but not least, we continue to receive an A rating from MSCI, one of the most widely, well-respected global organization for our broader ESG practices and disclosures. I'm extremely proud to be working with our Board of Directors, one of the most diverse in Corporate America in this commitment to create long-term and sustainable shareholder value per share through our ESG initiatives. With that, operator, we can open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: I got up at six this morning to be first in line. So the disclosure on the recovery is great. And I appreciate that you can't comment or know what the trajectory is going to be, but it is question number-one in every one of my conversations because right now, we have to deal with an elevated multiple because of trough earnings. And so people want to know what the snapback is going to look like. My estimates are down 30% versus pre-COVID because of all this noise. And so I guess the way I would ask the question is, if you can't give trajectory, what would disappoint you in terms of getting back to square one. Would you say, \"Boy, if we're not there in two years, that would be quite a disappointment.\" Can you kind of triangulate at least a range of expectations as opposed to committing to one?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. Thank you very much, Rich. I hope you don't have to wake up at 6 a.m. to be first in the line. But I'll just address the question, is any definitive answer for our end is as much of a guess from us as it is from you, right? So just understand there's no historical precedence to what's going on. We're simply telling you, if we go back asset by asset to where the NOI of these assets were, it's an important exercise because we have sold a lot of assets, bought a lot of assets, so it's very hard for you to figure out from our supplement what the number looks like. So we try to answer that question that if we just went back for the stabilized pool of assets to Q4 of '19, what will the NOI look like? And we add the filler portfolio and stabilize that, what does that combined look like. Now I cannot answer the question, whether it's two years or four years or it's - you've got to really put that in the context and your expectation. However, I will say this, and it's a very important point. It is to a Q4 2019 rent level a.k.a. that if you assume that this we expanded out, let's just say it will take four years from today to get to that stabilized level of NOI. So it's going to stabilize in 2026. You have to assume the rent of the business remains flat to achieve that NOI, right, which we don't think obviously is happening. We have continued to say that we expect that rent growth will hold up, right? So you might get it later, but you will get x number of years of rent growth to get added to that. Obviously, that rent growth has a contribution margin that's very high and it falls to the bottom line. On the other hand, if we say, okay, we're going to get that earlier, you are not going to get as much rent growth. You will only get, just say that you decide that you're going to get there in two years, right, I'm making this up. And two years up, so you will only get the rent growth from '19 to '23 instead of '19 to '26. So I'm pointing out that there are many levers here that you have to think through. The longer gestation period will bring you ultimately a higher number because of the rent growth aspect that I'm talking about versus the shorter. And that's all I'm willing to say right now. I can guess, but it is a guess. We're underwriting assets in a way that, frankly speaking, we don't need to know. That's why we're so focused on basis. If you look at our stock, it's a real estate company. You can look at what the basis looks like on a price per unit basis, and then go and think about what it takes to build that portfolio. You will see that portfolio trade had a significant discount to what it takes to build it today. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.\nJordanSadler: Wanted to hone in on a little bit of a different question, which is really the pacing of move-ins and move outs. It's something, Tim, that you addressed on the last call. And I couldn't help but notice that indexed move-ins are now above what seemed to be pre-pandemic levels or at least in March, they were 1031 on Slide 14 of your deck. And so that's pretty interesting. And I know it's probably - and you just addressed Shankh, you don't really want to speak to the potential trajectory of move in. So I totally get that. Can you just maybe talk to us about move outs? They're at negative one-one in March. So the indexes - they're below. Why would they remain sort of below pre-pandemic levels going forward? How would you be able to keep them? Or how would your operators be able to keep them below pre-pandemic levels for a sustained period that would sort of maintain or improve even this net absorption pace that we've recently seen?\nTimothy McHugh: Yes. Good question, Jordan. It's mainly due to just lower occupancy in the building. So right now, we're seeing 140 basis points below - we were 1,400 basis points below where we were pre-COVID on occupancy front. So you've just got substantially lower number of residents in the building. So if you run a kind of historical churn levels, it obviously changes occupancy builds and then move outs start to kind of match historical levels. But as historical churn levels, you should be running at around 80% of kind of indexed historical levels of move outs. If that gets elevated a bit, we've talked about this from a higher acuity resident moving in during COVID. That probably moves to mid to upper 80s. But that can stay, I think, pretty consistent through the recovery. It is tough looking at the last, kind of, six months ticking through what has been natural move-outs and what's been really - certainly a spike we've seen from COVID in the December, January, February period. I think what you're starting to see in March is a return to that kind of 80% level that we would expect, again, giving historical type of churn. But it's certainly something we're watching pretty closely. But from just a level of kind of the comment I made last quarter was from a level of occupancy in the buildings, that move out percentage, getting back to historical levels of 2019 levels of move-ins, you can drive 80, 90 basis points a month in occupancy by just getting back there because the move-outs are going to be lower, purely mathematically based off the occupancy level.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: I was hoping to get a few more details on the HC-One transaction in terms of the rate on the loan and then the strike price and amount of the warrants? And then what happened to the previous MEZ investment with them?\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Nick. The previous MEZ investments was paid off at par. And we are seeing in Q1 as a three-part investment. One is a combination of first mortgage, equity and warrant. And we think that combination will generate low to mid-double-digit type IRR. We also give you the basis which we invested a majority of that capital, the equity basis is slightly higher, but it's a substantial discount to replacement cost as well. So to hit those IRRS, you don't really need much of a expansion of multiple. What you need is the EBITDA to come back, which we think the management is already executing. And we've noted that the occupancy is already moving in the right direction. I'm not going to break out the specific part. You know that we do not believe in yields and cap rates determining investment success. We believe basis and IRRs get to the investment success and are consistent with that, and that's what we are willing to provide.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.\nVikram Malhotra: Shankh and Tim, maybe you can - if you can describe just the acquisition opportunity set as it's evolved over the last three or four months since your last call, you talked about potentially a $10 billion opportunity over time. HC-One obviously expands your opportunity set in the U.K. But if you could just talk about the opportunity set in terms of assets, returns? And also just in terms of underwriting, I think you referenced your underwriting, if I'm correct, differently or not to a set time and you don't need it because of the basis. But I just asked that because your math that you described here, obviously, talks about pre-COVID levels. We all know, obviously, before pre-COVID, we still had a five-year period of occupancy loss because of supply. So theoretically, there's even more upside. But if you can talk about the opportunity set and underwriting from that perspective, it would be helpful.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. Okay. Thank you, Vikram. First is the $10 billion number I mentioned, obviously, is a multiyear opportunity, not a one-year opportunity, right? So I just want to clarify that. But you're right in that expansion with obviously expanding with HC-One, this transaction expands that opportunity. I want you to understand, as I've said in my prepared remarks, that this investment is not just a financial investment, it's a strategic investment. And we looked at the company, its footprint, its management, and we see an opportunity that fills a big hole in our portfolio. Our portfolio in U.K. is very focused on high end, and we didn't have the value option. And there is a tremendous opportunity to grow in that value option, which we think we'll be able to execute through the HC-One platform. We structured the investment in the three tranches that we talked about. We don't go into an investment thinking we'll do debt, we'll do equity, we'll do MEZ or participating equity or. That's not how we think about it. We just look at an opportunity first. Think about what is the first asset opportunity and strategic opportunities, then think about how we get to invest capital so that we can be aligned with our partners. That's a very different approach than it's an asset, and we've got to buy it, are we going to lend to it. That's just not how we take. And it is the right risk-adjusted return. You look at an asset or a collection of assets or portfolio and you think about where in the capital structure even the best risk of return for your investors. Remember, there are different investors in the, obviously, the spectrum of this transaction. There is $235 million of equity on top of us, which obviously Safanad led investment group that includes Spanning and others, they're obviously bringing in, and they think there's an extraordinary opportunity to create value for their capital. Right? So that's a very important point. Now going back to sort of the pipeline, the pipeline is primarily today is senior housing, and the pipeline is very much what we talked about. It's significant. It's very robust. It's large. And it reflects a very significant discount to replacement cost. We're not going to sit here and tell you that we believe that every deal we'll do, we'll have this kind of return that we have described in HC-One, but as said before, that we think we can hit high single-digit to low double-digit IRR, and that environment is still here. We don't necessarily, given our cost of capital, need to hit that. But we're still seeing many, many, many opportunities that we have under contract today, that will get to you to that kind of return, which is in the high single-digit, low double-digit type of IRR. Hope that helps.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: On leading demand indicators and community details. It's certainly encouraging to see visitation and communal dining almost back to historic levels. One missing component is the current quarantine requirement for new residents. It is still the two weeks quarantine or perhaps longer, if not vaccinated. Then secondly, the lower level of in-person toward, is that being negatively impacted by restrictions in Canada versus other markets? Any geographic context is welcome.\nTimothy McHugh: Yes. Thanks, Derek. So I'll start with the question on quarantine. So this is a state-by-state process, part of my comments in my opening comments, part of the uncertainty around this is that it's local from a lot of the regulations around scaling back COVID regulations from last year, restrictions from last year. So we're seeing it kind of unfold state to state. But largely, the U.S. now quarantining restrictions are gone, if you come in vaccinated. If you don't come in vaccinated, then you do have quarantining. But you've seen through the success of the vaccination of the over 65 population in the U.S. and largely majority of move-ins now that we're seeing come in vaccinated and you're eliminating that quarantine period. And then the second question on tours, you're correct. Canada is dragging down statistics. So you've seen a vast improvement in the U.K., the U.S. is a little different state to state, but now largely, all states are allowing in-person tours. And Canada is still in a bit more of a restricted state.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: I wanted to jump on the HC-One transaction. I think, Shankh, you kind of already answered this a little bit. But when you think about that deal, should we think of it as more of a strategic type investment, an ability for you to continue to grow in the U.K. with that operator? Or was it more of an opportunistic type? I mean, since this is a debt investment, I guess, it's a little confusing on the strategic nature of it.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So, Mike, it's a great question. It is not a debt investment. It is a debt, it's structured as a lot of kind of capital deployed is debt investment, but it also comes with a very significant equity ownership through a warrant or future ownership through a warrant and kind ownership through the equity stakes. So that's how we thought about it. This is not an opportunistic investment. This is a strategic investment. If you look at our portfolio, you will see majority of our U.K. portfolio is kind of in that GBP 1,400 - GBP 1,350, GBP 1,400 per week to GBP 1,600 plus per week kind of. That's our sweet spot. And we think there is a real value option needed in U.K. on the private pay side, you can - there's a tremendous amount of business, tremendous depth of need in, let's call it, the GBP 900 to GBP 1,000 per week. So this fills a true strategic hole that we have in our portfolio, which we have been looking for a long time, not just the last 12 months, to fill that hole. And we think this will be our platform. And as we have talked to our partners here Safanad, we have always seen it as a strategic investment. That's what we have talked to James and David, who run HC-One, and we think you will see further capital deployment activity coming through it in that segment. We're not going to go - I don't want to speak for the management. I do not believe if suddenly they're pivoting the business going from GBP 1,000 a week to GBP 1,600 per week. That's not the vision of the company is. The vision is to grab that demand in that segment, and there's not a lot of quality and a lot of deep providers in that segment. So that's what we see here.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: I understand the potential for your show operator, senior housing operating partners to raise rents going forward. But when I look at costs, of which 60% labor do your operators have an expectation of increases to staff these properties? Labor costs were up 6% to 7% over the past couple of quarters. And given wage increases across the country, it seems like labor costs could inflate just as fast or even faster than rates. So any color on labor cost expectations and how you incorporated that on Slide 13 would be great.\nShankh Mitra: Yes, Jonathan. There's no question that you will have labor cost inflation. I do not believe that problem will be as acute as you have seen last five years when all the - frankly speaking, all of our portfolios, given where the locations are, regardless of local regulations have sort of moved at or above that $15 type of numbers. So you have seen a very significant increase of labor cost. Will you see labor cost inflation? Absolutely. But I think you will also see margin expansion from, as Tim talked about previously, we believe that you will see the margin expansion going back to the historic margins level. So it's a win at the end. I will tell you one thing, though. I would highly encourage you not to look at one quarter or one month of labor costs and projecting there. This is a lot of noise and volatility around the fact that a lot of people have received the stimulus check, and that has impacted short term. We do not believe that will be sustained as the sort of this dries up. However, you are right that labor cost inflation will remain, but it will not be what you see in other sectors, because what you are seeing in other sectors, such as lodging and all the sectors, they have laid off all their employees, they shutdown. Right? That was the case. For us, our communities have never shut down. They continue to employ our - obviously, because to take care of our residents, and that continues. Is there no issue? Absolutely not, will remain so. I would also encourage you to think about the potential immigration changes that is - we're hearing about. Obviously, I know it less - probably less than you do, but that also has an offsetting impact. So it's a long-term problem, but just understanding the demand-supply of labor as it relates to demand-supply of people and also how that impacts people's other choices at home, this will all come into place. We'll talk about it as we go through it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller: Just wondering how are the occupancy trends trending at the new development, say, filler properties compared to the more established properties that you have?\nTimothy McHugh: Right now, there's not much of a difference. I'd say we're seeing pretty uniform recovery across the board. So likely, we'll start to see that start to change as you see some of the filler properties accelerate just purely by their current occupancy level. But right now, we're seeing pretty uniform recovery across the board.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just hoping to spend a little time on the triple-net seniors housing business that hasn't had the same amount of focus. But if you could just try to help us understand kind of what has been done to date to rectify some of the low coverage, presumably some of the 2% decrease in same-store NOI in the first quarter was driven by some restructurings or adjustments. And you had - I think it looks like some straight-line rent write-offs in the quarter as per some of your supplemental slides. If you could just help us think through what you've done to date and maybe what's left to do because I think that's a big piece of the recovery once that bottoms about what the portfolio could look like going forward with more clarity on the shop side?\nTimothy McHugh: Yes, Juan. So I think the right way to think about it is, it has been the main focus win for us. And it seems to be for investors as well. But I think in the triple-net senior housing portfolio, around 20% of that in-place rent is now cash. So it pretty much reflects the underlying economics in those buildings. We have been pretty quick to move the cash when we have tenants that are not paying rent. So I think looking at our in-place, looking at our coverage metrics, those are tenants that are current on rent paying us and very much are doing so because of their long-term belief in their business. And if anything, I think what we've seen in the first quarter from the start of a recovery, enhances that belief that there will be - there won't be much impairment here. I think the other thing here is, I think, the difference between cash flow and value. And the underlying assets, I think you're seeing this across the board, are holding value. So the impairment to cash flow, I think, is short term. That speaks to the view there's a recovery. And so I don't think about this being a value prop to Welltower, and if anything, kind of a short-term liquidity problem with the operators.\nShankh Mitra: I'll just add, as I've said, probably every call we discussed it. So I'm not sure, Juan, why you think there's not been a focus. A majority of these leases that we have, and we're seeing - you should see that in our RIDEA portfolio as well. Usually, the assets are owned and the propco is jointly owned by the operator and us. And those - the operator's propco interest backed our lease, a.k.a, what you see as just from the rent does not reflect the collateral behind the lease. As you will see, these things get restructured, you will notice that value of operators that they own the real estate, their propco interest will really back this rent and will create substantial protection of downside for our shareholders. So I don't want to get into too much of details before everything is done. As I've said before, that you will continue to be surprised how much rent we continue to get from this portfolio? Will there be dilution of short-term cash flow? Absolutely will. And you're seeing that flowing through. Do we think there will be diminution of value? Absolutely not. So that's a general average statement. But that's what we continue to believe, and that's what you have seen through a hundred-year slide, once in a hundred-year slide, which is this pandemic, that held up, will continue to hold up.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky with Berenberg.\nConnor Siversky: Thanks for having me on the call. Just to follow-up on Juan's question. I'm wondering if this straight-line writedown was at all related to some of the movement we've seen in the top tenants? And if so, could you maybe provide some color on what we can know or what we could expect going forward?\nShankh Mitra: No. We will not, Connor. We do not talk about specific operators on this call. And that's not relevant. As I said, that this lease that we restructured, you're only seeing one side of that. You haven't seen the other side. And the operator has a substantial amount of ownership in the propco. And that ownership backed the rent, and this operator is an extraordinarily highly respected operator, and we think we'll get to a point that works for our shareholders and their ownership and you are only seeing one part of it. Just give us time, and you will see it will result into a mutually beneficial arrangement, where we will be able to protect all of our value.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: So one other debate point to add into the mix on the $480 million of embedded NOI. And that's really the Slide 10 as far as the construction versus inventory. As we look at your NOI margins in your SHO portfolio, it went from 32% to 30%, let's call it, from, I don't know, 2015, 2016 to 2019. A lot of that was that big increase in construction. Now that slide shows that's coming way down, which should alleviate some of the pressure as well. So I wanted to just talk about that on the plus side. And to the extent that you have some visibility, maybe just in your just overall strategic review of the industry, do you think that the number goes lower from here on that chart on the bottom of Slide 10 as far as construction versus?\nShankh Mitra: So, Steve, that's an extremely important portion. I tried to address that in my prepared remarks. Look, we're all guessing. Right? And we have to assume that people will do things that is economically beneficial to them. If you look at how much the costs have changed, let's just say - let's just talk about cost in the last three years. You have places in the coast, costs are probably up 20-plus percent, low 20%. And if you look at some of the locations in Dallas, Charlotte, Nashville, cost is up between 30% and 35%. The housing market is very significantly impacting not just the cost of lumber, which is everybody is talking about, but the cost and availability of labor. Right? So if you - that's sort of one big impact and a development model is a highly leveraged model. Right? So if you thought you're going to make 7% yield on cost and suddenly now looks like 5%, you are in trouble. But on the other hand, if you see what's going on, interest rate is backing up in a highly leveraged model. But definition development is a high leveraged model, with construction loans, etc. What you have is now interest rates backing up. So it's farther eating into your pro forma. And those two combinations, assuming people don't develop for fun, they want to develop to make money, that proposition is increasingly becoming very difficult. This is an industrywide comment. This is not - I'm not suggesting, see if you can go and develop a building in a given location and can't make money. That's not the point. As an industry wide, it is becoming much more difficult. And assuming people who want to develop to make money, that proposition is getting much, much harder. I'm not even talking about availability of debt capital, etc. The attractiveness of the model has been meaningfully hit in last, call it, three years, particularly last 12 months, as housing has just gone parabolic. So in that context, we think there will be, obviously, a lot less supply than it has been in the, call it, between '15 to '19. Also the '15 to '19, sort of the supply boom was, frankly, was created by a lot of the players, including our company, was paid $1.20, $1.5 on the dollar on the basis. I do not see those participants in the industry anymore. People are very, very - people who're involved in buying assets today, they're very focused on the right basis. And a lot of the sort of the take-out premium is meaningfully gone from the industry as well. So if we put all of those things together, we think that it is reasonable to expect. You can never accurately forecast what the future will look like. It is reasonable to expect that supply in the next five years will be a lot less than last five years, but it is yes, nonetheless. And we do think that will impact the rent growth, which is the point I was trying to make on the 480, is that is the beauty of basis. I highly encourage all of you to look at what is the in-flight per basis value of Welltower. And if you have to make at that basis a number, what rent do you need, versus what it takes to build and to make some minimum acceptable return, call it, 7%, whatever you think is the development yield should be and what is the rent. And you will see what it takes to build on our - today in our company, there's a huge gap between the potential rent, what's potential to bring new supply versus what you can get? That's not just to work our problem. I'm saying existing industry versus the new industry, and that will give you much more insight into what the rental may or may not be.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho.\nOmotayo Okusanya: I just wanted to go back to Juan and Connor's question about some of the restructured leases. And, Shankh, you made a point that you're working on structures to help you kind of recover some of the kind of initial rent breaks or whatever benefits you've kind of given these lease tenants in the short term. Could you just talk a little bit about what some of those kinds of lease terms would be to kind of make sure, again, you kind of get those benefits back in when ultimately this tenant starts to recover?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. That's a very good question. So there are many ways you can do this. If you keep the assets under lease, you can give obviously short-term rate and - but you can create two years out, three years out, depending on the level of EBITDA. You can do all bells and vessels to recoup that rent as cash flow comes back. And that's the point we're trying to make. Remember this is - cash flow is now starting to come back. Right? So that's sort of if you retain it, obviously, in the lease. Remember, these leases are not - there's nothing behind the leases. There's a propco interest sits behind the leases. So you have a value protection. If you go to RIDEA, right, we are not afraid just to get - take a rent stance, and if that is what, what is the sustainable level of rent from the sustainable level of production. Right? You saw that we bought a new - we bought a bunch of new assets in the reported quarter where we did a triple net. It was a highly respected operator. In that particular case, you would say, why didn't they do a RIDEA? Because if you look at in that portfolio, what we bought, the rent before us was substantially higher, right, 50% higher, that you are paying to the previous landlord. Our rent is much lower. We set it in a way. But then we have some sort of a catch-up. Our rent goes up, not by 3%, but as the EBITDA comes back significantly, and the EBITDA is already moving in that direction. We have a provision to get some more rent. It is also for the operator, at some point, they were paying 50% higher rent. And they will end up probably paying from the current rent level, 10% more, 15% more, but they will keep rest of the cash flow. Right? So it works out on both sides. Why does it works out on both sides. Because the basis is lower. The issue is not - a lease is fundamentally a form of a leverage and if you put a basis in the assets so much higher, and then you put a high LTV loan or high LTV credit for the lease, you are kind of creating problems from two ends. In this case, it's a very low basis that helps both parties, the owner as well as the operators to make money going forward. Going back to your specific question, there's a lot of collateral that sits behind these leases from this specific issue that Juan and Connor, and now you're asking about. This particular operator, which is one of the most respected operators in our space, has a substantial amount of propco interest that they have created through a very significant development machine through '90s. And that propco interest sits behind that lease. So let's just say, you can do it from a lease. This is just a statement or you can go to a RIDEA. Right? If you go to a RIDEA. Right? If you go to a RIDEA the ownership will change and will reflect the fact that their future liability is lower, aka we lost an asset. And we have acted that, backed lease, and we have an opportunity in that restructuring to own more of the real estate, not the same amount. That's the way to think about it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: So looking at a couple of different slides you guys have and just trying to put this all together. So you had this slide that's showing the future NOI potential getting back to pre-COVID occupancy. And yet at the same time, you're not providing full-year guidance for this year. So on one hand, you're implying a lot of optimism about getting back to an occupancy number, which is much higher than where you are right now. Yet you're not really willing to commit to an occupancy range on the year. And I guess I'm just wondering what is giving you confidence that you're going to get back to a higher occupancy level. I mean, the 20 basis points of April occupancy benefit seem like it's a smaller number than what you were talking about with your weekly benefit when you put out a presentation earlier this month. So I'm just trying to - I'm just wondering if there's something that you can point to, you have a backlog of pent-up demand that you're learning from prospective residents that going to increase move-ins as you get into the third quarter and beyond? I mean, what else can we sort of point to here that you think should give us confidence that you're going to get back to pre-COVID occupancy?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So nowhere on that slide, if you go back and see that we said we will. We just said, if we do go back to that occupancy, this is what the numbers looks like under this assumption of no rent cost and at the margin that it was at that point in time. You will decide whether we will go back or not go back, that's a matter of opinion. What we have stated on that slide is a matter of fact. So that's sort of the number one point. Number two point, we are nowhere implying that you will get to that number within a specific time frame. Full-year guidance that you have raised, that is a specific time frame. We're not committing to a specific time frame on that 480, which is on Slide 13 of the presentation because, frankly, we have no clue. Right? Third, I mentioned on my presentation or prepared remarks, that we are - this is probably the most optimistic I've heard, all of our operating partners from an industry momentum perspective were yet to see it on sort of in our occupancy. Hopefully, we'll see it. We're not baking. We're not sort of counting on it. We're not giving you an occupancy guidance per se. We're giving you an FFO guidance, and we're simply telling you what underlies that FFO guidance, which is basically straight-lining what we have seen so far. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street.\nLukas Hartwich: You said bottom-on shop occupancy. And it kind of looks steady based on some of the numbers you put in your release, but I'm just hoping you can talk a little bit more about the cadence of the increase in occupancy over the past six weeks? Is it steady, or is it bumpier? Just kind of curious what that looks like.\nShankh Mitra: Six weeks is not a long enough time frame, Lukas, to give you a trend. But if you insist, I can tell you if it is 60 basis points over six weeks, the weeks that are closer to us today have seen higher than the two and the weeks that are farther from us have seen lower than the 10. But six weeks is not a good enough time frame for you to project. At least we don't have confidence to project that. I can tell you the tone of our operating partners is a lot more positive than what you're seeing. I want to see first in the numbers and then talk about it. This is a highly uncertain environment. We're just not going to sit here and try to guess what things - how things might or might not play out. Remember, there is a possibility things can get much worse. If we have significant resurgence of COVID, it can get worse us. Right? So we're just telling you what we are seeing, we're telling you things, obviously, seasonally, we're seeing things improving. But we just were not ready to go out and tell you that things will successively get better every week, and we have some sort of a secret sauce to see that. It's just a highly uncertain environment.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.\nDaniel Bernstein: I just wanted to go back to the idea of pricing power within senior housing. And I haven't fully run the numbers, but my guess is with home prices rising significantly, rent prices rising significantly, senior housing is probably about as portable as it's been in the last 20 years. So I don't know if you've had discussions or thought about it with your operators, but maybe how - does that change the equation of what occupancy need to be for the industry to have pricing power? Traditionally, you think about 85% or better occupancy for pricing power, but maybe the equation has changed some. So just --\nShankh Mitra: Yes. I am happy to - Dan, very good question. I'm happy to start sort of the - engage in a guesswork with you. But it is a guesswork nonetheless. I can tell you, historically speaking, HPA or house price appreciation index has a very strong correlation with, obviously, rent growth. But this is a very interesting market. Right? It's unprecedented in many, many ways. You haven't seen this kind of housing shortage combined with demand. You haven't seen this kind of escalation of rent - I mean, cost that makes it very, very difficult to build something. Reasonably speaking, I would say, if all of those are together, you should see rent growth. At the same time, you have to acknowledge the fact that entire industry is in lease-up. Right? So I am not comfortable underwriting a lot of rent growth, but I also believe that you will see modest rent growth like you are seeing. Now do I think that three years from now, the rent growth will be better than what we are seeing today. That's reasonable to expect. Do I know for sure? No. But I think that's reasonable to expect.\nOperator: And we have a follow-up question from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street.\nLukas Hartwich: Thanks. On the HC-One loan, I'm just curious if you could provide the debt service coverage, what that looks like on free NOI from that portfolio or that company?\nShankh Mitra: Lukas, can I get back to you on that? I don't have that on top of my mind. I'll get back to you on that. I can tell you, on an LTV basis, if you ascribe no value to the actual business, which backs the loan, not just the real estate, the overall V in that LTV is extremely low. And it's a substantial, substantial discount to replacement cost. But I don't have the service coverage ratio pre-COVID basis in my head. I will call you off-line and give you that number.\nOperator: And we have a follow-up question from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Just a quick one for Tim. Tim, I noticed that there was a little bit of an equity issuance this quarter, about $270 million. Just talk a little bit about why that decision was made when, again, you guys have so much cash on the balance sheet.\nTimothy McHugh: Yes. It's a great question, and it really has to do with confidence in our pipeline. So we've got between our development spend and the external opportunities we're seeing, it's got less to do, and that's why you're seeing it done in a forward structure is it will fund activity when it occurs, but it's a highly visible activity.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Timothy McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Shank. My comments today will focus on our first-quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update, in addition to an outlook for the second quarter. After a year defined by infection protocols, move-in restrictions, and incredible operating challenges for our partners, we started 2021 in arguably the most challenging environment yet. With case counts hitting new highs across all three of our geographies and operating restrictions moving up in lockstep. Towards the end of February, the vaccine rollout hit its stride and nearly 80% of our facilities had their second vaccine finished. Case counts across the portfolio dropped precipitously, and we started to see the early signs of stabilization. The effectiveness and rapid deployment of vaccines within our communities are just starting to be felt across our resident population. And while we are encouraged by the last 6 weeks of recovery in the U.S. and U.K., significant uncertainty remains with respect to the prevalence of the virus among the general population, the timing of the reopening of the economy, and the timing of further rollbacks of operating restrictions, especially with respect to our Canadian portfolio. The result is a near-term operating environment that, although notably improved, remains highly unpredictable in the short term. As a result of this uncertainty, like last quarter, we provided a one-quarter outlook with our results last night. As we have done over the past 14-plus months, we will continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis with the intention of providing a more complete outlook as soon as the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for more reliable forecasting. Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.17 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share versus guidance of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. When providing guidance last quarter, we also provided expectations for $31 million of HHS provider relief funds we received in the quarter. We ended up recognizing approximately $34.7 million of HHS funds, along with $2.5 million of out-of-period payments for similar programs in Canada. Removing the impact of these funds, along with the $3.5 million termination fee that was received in one of our senior housing management company investments, which was not contemplating guidance, our normalized FFO moves to $0.70 per share. Therefore, on an apples-to-apples basis, we came out $0.01 above the top end of our HHS adjusted prior guidance of $0.64 to $0.69 per share. Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported one quarter in years. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2020. Importantly, our collection rate for rent remained high in the first quarter, having collected 96% of triple net contractual rent due in the period. Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio. Same-store decline 2% year over year as leases that we moved the cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against the prior year full contractual rent received. EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01 times on a sequential basis in the portfolio to 1.00. During the quarter, we transitioned the remaining five capital senior assets, moving one to triple-net structure under a new operator and the other four to various structure with CSU until transition. We also completed the transition of four properties leased by Hearth management to Storypoint under a new lease agreement. These transitions had a net positive impact of 0.02 times in total portfolio coverage. Next, our long-term post-new portfolio generated positive 0.2% year-over-year same-store growth, and EBITDAR coverage increased 0.37 times sequentially to 1.37 times. As 51 of the 79 Genesis assets began operator transitions. 23 assets have already transitioned as of this call, including nine former Powerback properties, which moved to ProMedica Senior Care. Pro forma for the already-completed ProMedica JV, Genesis Healthcare represents less than 90 basis points of our total in-place NOI. And long-term post-acute will be reduced to 6% of total NOI. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised by ProMedica Senior care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.8% year over year and trailing 12 EBITDAR coverage was 1.9 times. Before turning to outpatient medical, I want to highlight a disclosure change we made to our presentation of occupancy in our supplemental disclosure. Historically, we reported occupancy to 100% ownership. But going forward, we will present both at Welltower's pro-rata share to better reflect Welltower's ownership economics. This has no impact on NOI, which has always been presented at Welltower share. We have footnoted the occupancy levels if presented a 100% ownership in both the senior housing operating and medical office portion of our supplement. Now turning to our outpatient medical portfolio, which delivered positive 3.1% year-over-year same-store growth, as cash rent growth and higher platform profitability combined to producing acceleration in NOI growth. Tenant retention continued to be strong at 87.7% in the quarter, as we executed renewals on more than 540,000 square feet of space in the quarter, our highest amount ever reported. Additionally, we've also seen the length of term on executed renewal increases compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we completed our second joint venture with Invesco Real Estate for a portfolio of outpatient medical assets and completed our first with Wafra. Our ability to form joint ventures with best-in-class capital partners over the last two years has allowed us to maintain scale and more importantly, the tenant relationships generated from our in-house asset management platform. At the same time, we diversified our access to capital during a period of significant capital market turbulence. We look forward to growing these relationships further going forward. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to point out that we received approximately $35 million from our Department of Health and Human Services Cares Act provider relief fund. As we've done in the past quarters, the funds are recognized on a cash basis, and as such, will flow through financials in the quarter they are received. We're normalizing these HHS funds out of same-store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received they're not matched expenses occur in the period they received. In the first quarter, there were approximately $33.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied to the HHS program in the U.S. Now turning to results for the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 44% as compared to first-quarter 2020 and decreased 15.6% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Sequential same-store revenue was down 3.6% in Q1, driven primarily by a 310 basis point drop in average occupancy versus our guidance midpoint of 325 basis points. Turning to REVPOR in the quarter. Show portfolio REVPOR was down 1.5% year over year, but mix shift and an extra day of rent in the comparable leap-year quarter are distorting the true picture of rent growth metrics as over 40% of our revenue is derived on a per name basis. When adjusting for the leap year, total portfolio REVPOR growth moves to negative 1%. And breaking out our individual segments, our active adult independent living and assisted living segments reported year-over-year growth of positive 6.3%, positive 0.7%, and positive 1.6%, respectively. As I mentioned in the past few quarters, the combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by a considerable change in the composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio. Our lower acuity properties comprised of independent living and senior departments held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID, which has the mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity and therefore, lower rent-paying units. Rental rates are proving resilient, more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics. Lastly, expenses. Total same-store expenses declined 2.6% year over year and decreased 20 basis points sequentially. I'll focus on sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 20-basis-point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower COVID cover cost as case counts dropped dramatically in March. The meaningful decline in our top line, combined with these expense pressures had a significant impact to our operating margins, which declined 280 basis points sequentially to 19.4%. As I noted earlier in the call, we did not include government reimbursement that was not tied to parity expenses. And therefore, COVID expenses negatively impacted same-store by $14.8 million. We are not factoring any HHS funds into our second-quarter outlook. Looking forward to the second quarter, and starting with the April quarter-to-date data we've already observed, we've experienced 20 basis points through April 23, with the U.S., U.K. up 40 and 90 basis points, respectively, while Canada is down 20 basis points. While we are encouraged by the recovery in the U.S. and U.K. and are hopeful that the effectiveness of the vaccines has put a floor underneath operating results, we remain cautious on projecting an acceleration in recent trends, given the lack of historical precedents and uncertainty of reopening trend, particularly in Canada. On a spot basis, we are currently projecting a 130-basis-point increase in occupancy from March 31 through June 30. We expect monthly REVPOR to be plus 1.2% sequentially, although adjusting for the extra day in 2Q versus 1Q reduced to plus 70 basis points sequentially. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat. As increases in operating costs from higher occupancy should be offset by a reduction in COVID-related expenses. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to execute on our strategy of maximizing balance sheet stability. We're maintaining flexibility to position us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities. In March, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes due June 2031, bearing an interest rate of 2.8%, and used these proceeds to redeem all remaining senior unsecured notes due 2023. As a result, we were able to extend all senior unsecured debt maturities to 2024 and beyond, extend our weighted average maturity profile for nearly eight years. We also extinguished $42 million of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 7.6% in the quarter. In February, we highlighted a robust pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. As these transactions materialize, and the pipeline has grown, we've utilized our forward ATM program, selling 3.7 million shares of common stock to date at an initial average weighted price of $73.43 per share. These shares will generate future gross proceeds of approximately $272 million, and along with $1 billion of cash from our balance sheet, will enable us to officially capitalize our highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. Moving on to leverage. We ended the quarter at 6.59 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 31 basis point increase over the previous quarter as underlying cash flows continue to be pressured by the impact of COVID. While transactions closed in the second quarter will result in a slight increase in leverage, after adjusting for expected proceeds from assets held for sale and $272 million proceeds from the forward sale of common stock, we expect leverage to settle in the high sixes before the ramp in senior housing cash flows begin to naturally drive leverage lower in the coming quarters. Speaking of recovery, Shankh spoke earlier about the magnitude of potential cash flow growth from just returning to pre-COVID levels of margins and occupancy in our senior housing operating portfolio. This will have a significantly positive impact on cash flow-based leverage metrics. And although the duration of this recovery remains highly uncertain, the inflection point this quarterly is optimistic that it has begun. And our demonstrated ability to access significant equity proceeds through asset sales, even in the most difficult times, along with our return the equity market since last quarter, leaves us confident that we'll be able to keep the balance sheet in a position of strength as a natural deleveraging when the senior housing recovery returns us to well within our historical target levels in the not-too-distant future. Lastly, moving to our second-quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.31 to $0.36. And normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.72 to $0.77 per share. As I noted earlier, this guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS funds or similar government programs in the U.K. and Canada. So when comparing sequentially to our first quarter normalized FFO per share, use a $0.70 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes the benefits of these programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our second-quarter guidance of $0.745 per share represents a $0.045 sequential increase from 1Q. The $0.045 increase is composed of a $0.02 increase per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs, a $0.025 per share increase in net investment activity as strong post quarter investments is offsetting the initial dilution from loan reductions and operator transitions related to Genesis. A $0.01 increase in NOI from triple-net and outpatient medical segments, and this is offset by the expected $0.01 increase in sequential G&A, driven mainly by new hires. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Shankh. Yes. Good question, Jordan. It's mainly due to just lower occupancy in the building. So right now, we're seeing 140 basis points below - we were 1,400 basis points below where we were pre-COVID on occupancy front. So you've just got substantially lower number of residents in the building. So if you run a kind of historical churn levels, it obviously changes occupancy builds and then move outs start to kind of match historical levels. But as historical churn levels, you should be running at around 80% of kind of indexed historical levels of move outs. If that gets elevated a bit, we've talked about this from a higher acuity resident moving in during COVID. That probably moves to mid to upper 80s. But that can stay, I think, pretty consistent through the recovery. It is tough looking at the last, kind of, six months ticking through what has been natural move-outs and what's been really - certainly a spike we've seen from COVID in the December, January, February period. I think what you're starting to see in March is a return to that kind of 80% level that we would expect, again, giving historical type of churn. But it's certainly something we're watching pretty closely. But from just a level of kind of the comment I made last quarter was from a level of occupancy in the buildings, that move out percentage, getting back to historical levels of 2019 levels of move-ins, you can drive 80, 90 basis points a month in occupancy by just getting back there because the move-outs are going to be lower, purely mathematically based off the occupancy level. Yes. Thanks, Derek. So I'll start with the question on quarantine. So this is a state-by-state process, part of my comments in my opening comments, part of the uncertainty around this is that it's local from a lot of the regulations around scaling back COVID regulations from last year, restrictions from last year. So we're seeing it kind of unfold state to state. But largely, the U.S. now quarantining restrictions are gone, if you come in vaccinated. If you don't come in vaccinated, then you do have quarantining. But you've seen through the success of the vaccination of the over 65 population in the U.S. and largely majority of move-ins now that we're seeing come in vaccinated and you're eliminating that quarantine period. And then the second question on tours, you're correct. Canada is dragging down statistics. So you've seen a vast improvement in the U.K., the U.S. is a little different state to state, but now largely, all states are allowing in-person tours. And Canada is still in a bit more of a restricted state. Right now, there's not much of a difference. I'd say we're seeing pretty uniform recovery across the board. So likely, we'll start to see that start to change as you see some of the filler properties accelerate just purely by their current occupancy level. But right now, we're seeing pretty uniform recovery across the board. Yes, Juan. So I think the right way to think about it is, it has been the main focus win for us. And it seems to be for investors as well. But I think in the triple-net senior housing portfolio, around 20% of that in-place rent is now cash. So it pretty much reflects the underlying economics in those buildings. We have been pretty quick to move the cash when we have tenants that are not paying rent. So I think looking at our in-place, looking at our coverage metrics, those are tenants that are current on rent paying us and very much are doing so because of their long-term belief in their business. And if anything, I think what we've seen in the first quarter from the start of a recovery, enhances that belief that there will be - there won't be much impairment here. I think the other thing here is, I think, the difference between cash flow and value. And the underlying assets, I think you're seeing this across the board, are holding value. So the impairment to cash flow, I think, is short term. That speaks to the view there's a recovery. And so I don't think about this being a value prop to Welltower, and if anything, kind of a short-term liquidity problem with the operators. Yes. It's a great question, and it really has to do with confidence in our pipeline. So we've got between our development spend and the external opportunities we're seeing, it's got less to do, and that's why you're seeing it done in a forward structure is it will fund activity when it occurs, but it's a highly visible activity."

            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. I'll make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing business, our ongoing alignment efforts with our operating partners, and we will also provide a detailed perspective on our current thoughts related to capital allocation. Tim will then get into detailed operating and financial results. We are cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business with greenshoots emerging in U.S. and U.K. While it is too early to raise an all fear flag as another COVID resurgence can never be ruled out, we're delighted to report an occupancy increase of 120 bps in U.K. and 90 bps in U.S. over the past six weeks. Despite growing optimism in U.S. and U.K., performance in Canada has remained somewhat weak due to increased COVID cases across many regions. While most residents within our Canadian senior housing properties have been vaccinated, the rollout to the broader population has lagged meaningfully due to lockdown in certain areas within Ontario and Quebec, move in stores and visitation have been highly restricted, which has ultimately led to an occupancy loss of 50 basis points since mid-March. This trend has improved in April. Despite the drag from Canada, the move in activity in March is higher than the last non-COVID impacted month of February of 2020. In addition, as I have described in past quarters, rates continue to hold. As adjusted for 2020 leap year, AL rates are up 1.6%, IL rates are up 0.7%, mostly dragged down by the Canadian business. Senior apartments and wellness housing rates are up 6.3%. Our operators across the board are seeing broad momentum that continued to build, irrespective type, geography, activity, this is the most optimistic tone I've heard from our operating partners in a long time. We're even seeing the lifestyle-driven customers are starting to come back, which frankly surprised me in a positive way. Fundamental results have exceeded our expectations in Q1, and we're anticipating strong momentum in Q2. While we continue to avoid speculation on what the arc of the recovery may look like, we have provided additional disclosure on the additional LOI and earnings power of our portfolio assuming a return to 2019 level of NOI for our stable portfolio and adding incremental NOI from our filler portfolio. We believe this results in additional $480 million of NOI. And remember, this assumes a return to 2019 level of occupancy and margin, and it does not assume a return to frictional vacancy or any rate growth since Q4 of 2019. We're seeing something similar happening in the private market. While current cash flow multiples of what we are buying might be high as compared to what we're willing to pay two to three years ago, this is a moot point. We're paying a much lower multiple and a stabilized cash flow as evidenced by a much lower price per unit. While in most other asset classes, this could be a matter of opinion, I believe in real estate it is a simple business where you can obtain a very granular view of price per unit and how this compares to replacement cost. While we can sit here and debate how different assets and portfolio prices compared to prices per unit two to three years ago, replacement costs are shooting upwards with a white-hot housing market driving construction costs exponentially higher in recent quarters. This phenomena is now spilling into other material costs due to a $2 trillion infrastructure plan announced by the Biden administration. As costs continue to rise, the market-clearing rent to achieve minimum acceptable return is also ratcheting up. However, those returns are not going to be easy to achieve. Today, as much of the senior housing industry effectively remains a lease-up mode, given the impact of COVID on occupancy. If this was not enough, now the interest rate curve is backing up, creating further pressure on developers pro forma. This backdrop clearly is unique to the current cycle, which we believe will result in meaningfully lower new starts in near to medium term. The supply outlook, along with already rising demographic growth in the first half of the decade gives us confidence that we'll achieve the level of asset performance that we provided. Although I have nothing to add in terms of the timing and/or the trajectory of the recovery, our analysis was done one asset at a time, and I hope you will find this new disclosure useful. During the first quarter, we continued our effort to create greater alignment of interest with our operating partners by restructuring several relationship constructs. And as we mentioned on our last call, we have made structural changes to several senior housing agreements. I would also like to highlight some recently announced strategic transactions with Genesis and ProMedica, with elements of both deals reflects our approach to value creation for our shareholders. First, Genesis. As we announced last month, after 10 years, we have substantially exited our Genesis real estate relationship through a series of transactions, which meaningfully derisked our cash flow stream going forward. Effectuating this nearly $900 million a transaction wasn't easy. It involved a skilled nursing operator deeply impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, the transitional access to local and regional operators working through our outstanding loans to Genesis, at the same time, creating opportunity for Welltower to participate in the post-COVID recovery in post acute fundamentals. Ultimately, we executed a mutually beneficial transaction for Genesis and Welltower shareholders. For Genesis, the transaction resulted in a meaningful deleveraging of its balance sheet, which will help you to reposition the company post-COVID-19. And for Welltower, we're able to execute the transaction at a par bid value of $144,000 and generated an 8.5% unlevered return over the full term of Genesis relationship. And upon the repayment of the outstanding debt, that return will rise to 9% with even further upside potential from participating preferred and the equity position. We believe that this represents a very favorable outcome for the shareholders, Welltower shareholders, particularly in light of the challenging environment that we have faced in the post-acute sector and then COVID-related pandemic-induced downside we have seen. While transactions will result in some near-term earnings dilution for Welltower, we expect to create significant value for our shareholders following the deployment of the $745 million of anticipated proceeds over a range of high-quality opportunity that I'll discuss shortly. Since our announcement last month, Genesis has received an infusion of equity capital and named a specialist in Harry Wilson as CEO. We wish the team of Genesis much success in the future as we have substantially exited a challenging legacy structure with Genesis, I hope our shareholders appreciate the favorable ultimate outcome. As we have done with several operating relationship over the last few years and discussed on various calls, our team embraced complexity, fixed creative solutions, doesn't run away from their problems and situations where the choices may be imperfect and ultimately work tirelessly to fulfill our commitment to our owners, operating partners, and employees. Second, ProMedica. We announced two transactions to strengthen and expand our relationship with ProMedica, which will enhance the quality of our joint venture position and continued growth. The first transaction involved $265 million sale of 25 skilled nursing assets with an average age of 41 years, which will result in an immediate improvement to the quality of the portfolio. At the same time, we also crystallized a 22% unlevered IRR over two and a half years of ownership of the asset, which is a true reflection of the power of our value-oriented investment philosophy. We at Welltower firmly believe that basis not yield or cap rates determine investment success. Through a separate transaction, we are pleased to maintain an 80% stake in our state-of-the-art assets which has been contributed to our 80/20 joint venture with ProMedica. ProMedica has already assumed the operations of these assets, which have been rebranded as ProMedica Senior Care. This successful transaction is yet another example of our focus on improving quality and growth profile of our portfolio while doing so at favorable economic terms to all stakeholders. ProMedica team is making progress in developing new relationship with other health systems as a provider of choice as Promedica represents the premium not-for-profit provider at the leading age of healthcare evolution. We're hopeful that we'll be able to deploy far-direct creative capital with this innovative partner of ours. Speaking of accretive capital deployment, we are pleased to share with you that we have closed in excess of $1.3 billion of acquisitions year to date with very attractive unlevered IRR, in particular, extremely happy to announce that we have partnered with a Safanad led investment group to recapitalize HC-One, the largest and most reputable operator of care homes communities in U.K. Our investment in excess of $800 million comes in form of first mortgage debt on HC-One's real estate and equity in recapitalization. We also received significant warrants that would further allow us to participate in the post-COVID upside that we are confident that management in process of executing. HC-One will add a value option to our high-end focused U.K. platform. There is significant opportunity to upgrade the asset base, operating platform and people in this portfolio, and we have tremendous confidence in James and David to fulfill their mission to deliver the highest quality care, along with the residents and employee satisfaction. In recent weeks, HC-One has experienced the same positive occupancy momentum as our broader U.K. portfolio, gaining 90 bps of occupancy from the March 2021 trough. Our debt investment represents the last found exposure of just $40,000 far unit and important statistic given our unrelenting focus on basis. This basis also represents a significant discount to replacement costs, in addition to the upside from equity and warrants. We think this is an extraordinary risk-adjusted return story. We believe we'll be able to generate low to mid-teens on IRR from this transaction while adding a highly strategic partner to fill a gap that we have in our portfolio in the U.K. With acquisitions, patience is a virtue and so is occasional boldness. Since we mentioned in our October call, the moment of boldness is here, we have closed in excess of $1.8 billion of acquisitions. The initial yield of this whole tranche is 6.8%, but we expect it will stabilize at a significantly higher number. When while the environment was very uncertain then, and we didn't give into institutional imperative about headline pressures, and we relied on independent thinking and resilience of our team. We remain very bullish on acquisition opportunities and have several attractive deals under contract currently and a highly visible pipeline, which we think we'll be able to execute through year end. While our focus continues to be on the right asset with the right basis and with the right operator, I'm hopeful that our 2021 class of acquisition will be immediately accretive to 2022 earnings and will be significantly accretive to 2023 and beyond. Lastly, I will address a very interesting question I have received from an investor post our last call. I was asked why we have such an emphasis on partner selection and whether it would be better off vertically integrating. We think this is an excellent question that deserves some reflecting for a moment. Notwithstanding the RIDEA law in senior housing, we believe we're better off in the ecosystem of partners and implementing an industrial view of vertical integration. That view is rooted in our belief that the combination of centralized capital allocation and decentralized execution creates the best long-term return. We believe this strategy of decentralized execution relates to energy and keeps politics and costs at bay. This is especially important in real estate, which is profoundly a local business. However, overall, we are happy with our execution so far in the year to create partial value for our shareholders, but by no means we are satisfied. We are cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment and excited about our opportunity to acquire assets, create new relationships, and attract quality challenges. With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim? Thank you, Tim. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic on our business, we have remained resolute in our commitment to ESG initiatives. In fact, our efforts on this front have only grown over the past year, and we are pleased to report significant progress, not just in terms of numerous awards and accolades we have received, but also by our action to strengthen and expand our ESG platform, which we believe will bear fruit in many years to come. We have recently received the Energy Star Partner of the Year award for the third consecutive year and elevated to the level of sustained excellence, the EPA's highest recognition within the Energy Star program. We have also been honored that our social initiatives we are recognized with the quality score of one by IFF, the highest ranking in the social category. And last but not least, we continue to receive an A rating from MSCI, one of the most widely, well-respected global organization for our broader ESG practices and disclosures. I'm extremely proud to be working with our Board of Directors, one of the most diverse in Corporate America in this commitment to create long-term and sustainable shareholder value per share through our ESG initiatives. With that, operator, we can open it up for questions. Yes. Thank you very much, Rich. I hope you don't have to wake up at 6 a.m. to be first in the line. But I'll just address the question, is any definitive answer for our end is as much of a guess from us as it is from you, right? So just understand there's no historical precedence to what's going on. We're simply telling you, if we go back asset by asset to where the NOI of these assets were, it's an important exercise because we have sold a lot of assets, bought a lot of assets, so it's very hard for you to figure out from our supplement what the number looks like. So we try to answer that question that if we just went back for the stabilized pool of assets to Q4 of '19, what will the NOI look like? And we add the filler portfolio and stabilize that, what does that combined look like. Now I cannot answer the question, whether it's two years or four years or it's - you've got to really put that in the context and your expectation. However, I will say this, and it's a very important point. It is to a Q4 2019 rent level a.k.a. that if you assume that this we expanded out, let's just say it will take four years from today to get to that stabilized level of NOI. So it's going to stabilize in 2026. You have to assume the rent of the business remains flat to achieve that NOI, right, which we don't think obviously is happening. We have continued to say that we expect that rent growth will hold up, right? So you might get it later, but you will get x number of years of rent growth to get added to that. Obviously, that rent growth has a contribution margin that's very high and it falls to the bottom line. On the other hand, if we say, okay, we're going to get that earlier, you are not going to get as much rent growth. You will only get, just say that you decide that you're going to get there in two years, right, I'm making this up. And two years up, so you will only get the rent growth from '19 to '23 instead of '19 to '26. So I'm pointing out that there are many levers here that you have to think through. The longer gestation period will bring you ultimately a higher number because of the rent growth aspect that I'm talking about versus the shorter. And that's all I'm willing to say right now. I can guess, but it is a guess. We're underwriting assets in a way that, frankly speaking, we don't need to know. That's why we're so focused on basis. If you look at our stock, it's a real estate company. You can look at what the basis looks like on a price per unit basis, and then go and think about what it takes to build that portfolio. You will see that portfolio trade had a significant discount to what it takes to build it today. Thank you. Thank you, Nick. The previous MEZ investments was paid off at par. And we are seeing in Q1 as a three-part investment. One is a combination of first mortgage, equity and warrant. And we think that combination will generate low to mid-double-digit type IRR. We also give you the basis which we invested a majority of that capital, the equity basis is slightly higher, but it's a substantial discount to replacement cost as well. So to hit those IRRS, you don't really need much of a expansion of multiple. What you need is the EBITDA to come back, which we think the management is already executing. And we've noted that the occupancy is already moving in the right direction. I'm not going to break out the specific part. You know that we do not believe in yields and cap rates determining investment success. We believe basis and IRRs get to the investment success and are consistent with that, and that's what we are willing to provide. Yes. Okay. Thank you, Vikram. First is the $10 billion number I mentioned, obviously, is a multiyear opportunity, not a one-year opportunity, right? So I just want to clarify that. But you're right in that expansion with obviously expanding with HC-One, this transaction expands that opportunity. I want you to understand, as I've said in my prepared remarks, that this investment is not just a financial investment, it's a strategic investment. And we looked at the company, its footprint, its management, and we see an opportunity that fills a big hole in our portfolio. Our portfolio in U.K. is very focused on high end, and we didn't have the value option. And there is a tremendous opportunity to grow in that value option, which we think we'll be able to execute through the HC-One platform. We structured the investment in the three tranches that we talked about. We don't go into an investment thinking we'll do debt, we'll do equity, we'll do MEZ or participating equity or. That's not how we think about it. We just look at an opportunity first. Think about what is the first asset opportunity and strategic opportunities, then think about how we get to invest capital so that we can be aligned with our partners. That's a very different approach than it's an asset, and we've got to buy it, are we going to lend to it. That's just not how we take. And it is the right risk-adjusted return. You look at an asset or a collection of assets or portfolio and you think about where in the capital structure even the best risk of return for your investors. Remember, there are different investors in the, obviously, the spectrum of this transaction. There is $235 million of equity on top of us, which obviously Safanad led investment group that includes Spanning and others, they're obviously bringing in, and they think there's an extraordinary opportunity to create value for their capital. Right? So that's a very important point. Now going back to sort of the pipeline, the pipeline is primarily today is senior housing, and the pipeline is very much what we talked about. It's significant. It's very robust. It's large. And it reflects a very significant discount to replacement cost. We're not going to sit here and tell you that we believe that every deal we'll do, we'll have this kind of return that we have described in HC-One, but as said before, that we think we can hit high single-digit to low double-digit IRR, and that environment is still here. We don't necessarily, given our cost of capital, need to hit that. But we're still seeing many, many, many opportunities that we have under contract today, that will get to you to that kind of return, which is in the high single-digit, low double-digit type of IRR. Hope that helps. Yes. So, Mike, it's a great question. It is not a debt investment. It is a debt, it's structured as a lot of kind of capital deployed is debt investment, but it also comes with a very significant equity ownership through a warrant or future ownership through a warrant and kind ownership through the equity stakes. So that's how we thought about it. This is not an opportunistic investment. This is a strategic investment. If you look at our portfolio, you will see majority of our U.K. portfolio is kind of in that GBP 1,400 - GBP 1,350, GBP 1,400 per week to GBP 1,600 plus per week kind of. That's our sweet spot. And we think there is a real value option needed in U.K. on the private pay side, you can - there's a tremendous amount of business, tremendous depth of need in, let's call it, the GBP 900 to GBP 1,000 per week. So this fills a true strategic hole that we have in our portfolio, which we have been looking for a long time, not just the last 12 months, to fill that hole. And we think this will be our platform. And as we have talked to our partners here Safanad, we have always seen it as a strategic investment. That's what we have talked to James and David, who run HC-One, and we think you will see further capital deployment activity coming through it in that segment. We're not going to go - I don't want to speak for the management. I do not believe if suddenly they're pivoting the business going from GBP 1,000 a week to GBP 1,600 per week. That's not the vision of the company is. The vision is to grab that demand in that segment, and there's not a lot of quality and a lot of deep providers in that segment. So that's what we see here. Yes, Jonathan. There's no question that you will have labor cost inflation. I do not believe that problem will be as acute as you have seen last five years when all the - frankly speaking, all of our portfolios, given where the locations are, regardless of local regulations have sort of moved at or above that $15 type of numbers. So you have seen a very significant increase of labor cost. Will you see labor cost inflation? Absolutely. But I think you will also see margin expansion from, as Tim talked about previously, we believe that you will see the margin expansion going back to the historic margins level. So it's a win at the end. I will tell you one thing, though. I would highly encourage you not to look at one quarter or one month of labor costs and projecting there. This is a lot of noise and volatility around the fact that a lot of people have received the stimulus check, and that has impacted short term. We do not believe that will be sustained as the sort of this dries up. However, you are right that labor cost inflation will remain, but it will not be what you see in other sectors, because what you are seeing in other sectors, such as lodging and all the sectors, they have laid off all their employees, they shutdown. Right? That was the case. For us, our communities have never shut down. They continue to employ our - obviously, because to take care of our residents, and that continues. Is there no issue? Absolutely not, will remain so. I would also encourage you to think about the potential immigration changes that is - we're hearing about. Obviously, I know it less - probably less than you do, but that also has an offsetting impact. So it's a long-term problem, but just understanding the demand-supply of labor as it relates to demand-supply of people and also how that impacts people's other choices at home, this will all come into place. We'll talk about it as we go through it. I'll just add, as I've said, probably every call we discussed it. So I'm not sure, Juan, why you think there's not been a focus. A majority of these leases that we have, and we're seeing - you should see that in our RIDEA portfolio as well. Usually, the assets are owned and the propco is jointly owned by the operator and us. And those - the operator's propco interest backed our lease, a.k.a, what you see as just from the rent does not reflect the collateral behind the lease. As you will see, these things get restructured, you will notice that value of operators that they own the real estate, their propco interest will really back this rent and will create substantial protection of downside for our shareholders. So I don't want to get into too much of details before everything is done. As I've said before, that you will continue to be surprised how much rent we continue to get from this portfolio? Will there be dilution of short-term cash flow? Absolutely will. And you're seeing that flowing through. Do we think there will be diminution of value? Absolutely not. So that's a general average statement. But that's what we continue to believe, and that's what you have seen through a hundred-year slide, once in a hundred-year slide, which is this pandemic, that held up, will continue to hold up. No. We will not, Connor. We do not talk about specific operators on this call. And that's not relevant. As I said, that this lease that we restructured, you're only seeing one side of that. You haven't seen the other side. And the operator has a substantial amount of ownership in the propco. And that ownership backed the rent, and this operator is an extraordinarily highly respected operator, and we think we'll get to a point that works for our shareholders and their ownership and you are only seeing one part of it. Just give us time, and you will see it will result into a mutually beneficial arrangement, where we will be able to protect all of our value. So, Steve, that's an extremely important portion. I tried to address that in my prepared remarks. Look, we're all guessing. Right? And we have to assume that people will do things that is economically beneficial to them. If you look at how much the costs have changed, let's just say - let's just talk about cost in the last three years. You have places in the coast, costs are probably up 20-plus percent, low 20%. And if you look at some of the locations in Dallas, Charlotte, Nashville, cost is up between 30% and 35%. The housing market is very significantly impacting not just the cost of lumber, which is everybody is talking about, but the cost and availability of labor. Right? So if you - that's sort of one big impact and a development model is a highly leveraged model. Right? So if you thought you're going to make 7% yield on cost and suddenly now looks like 5%, you are in trouble. But on the other hand, if you see what's going on, interest rate is backing up in a highly leveraged model. But definition development is a high leveraged model, with construction loans, etc. What you have is now interest rates backing up. So it's farther eating into your pro forma. And those two combinations, assuming people don't develop for fun, they want to develop to make money, that proposition is increasingly becoming very difficult. This is an industrywide comment. This is not - I'm not suggesting, see if you can go and develop a building in a given location and can't make money. That's not the point. As an industry wide, it is becoming much more difficult. And assuming people who want to develop to make money, that proposition is getting much, much harder. I'm not even talking about availability of debt capital, etc. The attractiveness of the model has been meaningfully hit in last, call it, three years, particularly last 12 months, as housing has just gone parabolic. So in that context, we think there will be, obviously, a lot less supply than it has been in the, call it, between '15 to '19. Also the '15 to '19, sort of the supply boom was, frankly, was created by a lot of the players, including our company, was paid $1.20, $1.5 on the dollar on the basis. I do not see those participants in the industry anymore. People are very, very - people who're involved in buying assets today, they're very focused on the right basis. And a lot of the sort of the take-out premium is meaningfully gone from the industry as well. So if we put all of those things together, we think that it is reasonable to expect. You can never accurately forecast what the future will look like. It is reasonable to expect that supply in the next five years will be a lot less than last five years, but it is yes, nonetheless. And we do think that will impact the rent growth, which is the point I was trying to make on the 480, is that is the beauty of basis. I highly encourage all of you to look at what is the in-flight per basis value of Welltower. And if you have to make at that basis a number, what rent do you need, versus what it takes to build and to make some minimum acceptable return, call it, 7%, whatever you think is the development yield should be and what is the rent. And you will see what it takes to build on our - today in our company, there's a huge gap between the potential rent, what's potential to bring new supply versus what you can get? That's not just to work our problem. I'm saying existing industry versus the new industry, and that will give you much more insight into what the rental may or may not be. Yes. That's a very good question. So there are many ways you can do this. If you keep the assets under lease, you can give obviously short-term rate and - but you can create two years out, three years out, depending on the level of EBITDA. You can do all bells and vessels to recoup that rent as cash flow comes back. And that's the point we're trying to make. Remember this is - cash flow is now starting to come back. Right? So that's sort of if you retain it, obviously, in the lease. Remember, these leases are not - there's nothing behind the leases. There's a propco interest sits behind the leases. So you have a value protection. If you go to RIDEA, right, we are not afraid just to get - take a rent stance, and if that is what, what is the sustainable level of rent from the sustainable level of production. Right? You saw that we bought a new - we bought a bunch of new assets in the reported quarter where we did a triple net. It was a highly respected operator. In that particular case, you would say, why didn't they do a RIDEA? Because if you look at in that portfolio, what we bought, the rent before us was substantially higher, right, 50% higher, that you are paying to the previous landlord. Our rent is much lower. We set it in a way. But then we have some sort of a catch-up. Our rent goes up, not by 3%, but as the EBITDA comes back significantly, and the EBITDA is already moving in that direction. We have a provision to get some more rent. It is also for the operator, at some point, they were paying 50% higher rent. And they will end up probably paying from the current rent level, 10% more, 15% more, but they will keep rest of the cash flow. Right? So it works out on both sides. Why does it works out on both sides. Because the basis is lower. The issue is not - a lease is fundamentally a form of a leverage and if you put a basis in the assets so much higher, and then you put a high LTV loan or high LTV credit for the lease, you are kind of creating problems from two ends. In this case, it's a very low basis that helps both parties, the owner as well as the operators to make money going forward. Going back to your specific question, there's a lot of collateral that sits behind these leases from this specific issue that Juan and Connor, and now you're asking about. This particular operator, which is one of the most respected operators in our space, has a substantial amount of propco interest that they have created through a very significant development machine through '90s. And that propco interest sits behind that lease. So let's just say, you can do it from a lease. This is just a statement or you can go to a RIDEA. Right? If you go to a RIDEA. Right? If you go to a RIDEA the ownership will change and will reflect the fact that their future liability is lower, aka we lost an asset. And we have acted that, backed lease, and we have an opportunity in that restructuring to own more of the real estate, not the same amount. That's the way to think about it. Yes. So nowhere on that slide, if you go back and see that we said we will. We just said, if we do go back to that occupancy, this is what the numbers looks like under this assumption of no rent cost and at the margin that it was at that point in time. You will decide whether we will go back or not go back, that's a matter of opinion. What we have stated on that slide is a matter of fact. So that's sort of the number one point. Number two point, we are nowhere implying that you will get to that number within a specific time frame. Full-year guidance that you have raised, that is a specific time frame. We're not committing to a specific time frame on that 480, which is on Slide 13 of the presentation because, frankly, we have no clue. Right? Third, I mentioned on my presentation or prepared remarks, that we are - this is probably the most optimistic I've heard, all of our operating partners from an industry momentum perspective were yet to see it on sort of in our occupancy. Hopefully, we'll see it. We're not baking. We're not sort of counting on it. We're not giving you an occupancy guidance per se. We're giving you an FFO guidance, and we're simply telling you what underlies that FFO guidance, which is basically straight-lining what we have seen so far. Hopefully, that answers your question. Six weeks is not a long enough time frame, Lukas, to give you a trend. But if you insist, I can tell you if it is 60 basis points over six weeks, the weeks that are closer to us today have seen higher than the two and the weeks that are farther from us have seen lower than the 10. But six weeks is not a good enough time frame for you to project. At least we don't have confidence to project that. I can tell you the tone of our operating partners is a lot more positive than what you're seeing. I want to see first in the numbers and then talk about it. This is a highly uncertain environment. We're just not going to sit here and try to guess what things - how things might or might not play out. Remember, there is a possibility things can get much worse. If we have significant resurgence of COVID, it can get worse us. Right? So we're just telling you what we are seeing, we're telling you things, obviously, seasonally, we're seeing things improving. But we just were not ready to go out and tell you that things will successively get better every week, and we have some sort of a secret sauce to see that. It's just a highly uncertain environment. Yes. I am happy to - Dan, very good question. I'm happy to start sort of the - engage in a guesswork with you. But it is a guesswork nonetheless. I can tell you, historically speaking, HPA or house price appreciation index has a very strong correlation with, obviously, rent growth. But this is a very interesting market. Right? It's unprecedented in many, many ways. You haven't seen this kind of housing shortage combined with demand. You haven't seen this kind of escalation of rent - I mean, cost that makes it very, very difficult to build something. Reasonably speaking, I would say, if all of those are together, you should see rent growth. At the same time, you have to acknowledge the fact that entire industry is in lease-up. Right? So I am not comfortable underwriting a lot of rent growth, but I also believe that you will see modest rent growth like you are seeing. Now do I think that three years from now, the rent growth will be better than what we are seeing today. That's reasonable to expect. Do I know for sure? No. But I think that's reasonable to expect. Lukas, can I get back to you on that? I don't have that on top of my mind. I'll get back to you on that. I can tell you, on an LTV basis, if you ascribe no value to the actual business, which backs the loan, not just the real estate, the overall V in that LTV is extremely low. And it's a substantial, substantial discount to replacement cost. But I don't have the service coverage ratio pre-COVID basis in my head. I will call you off-line and give you that number."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead.\nMatt McQueen: Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement are detailed in the Company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I will review fourth quarter and the year and describe high-level business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on operational performance of our SHO and MOB portfolios. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net business, balance sheet highlights and 2023 full year guidance. Nikhil, our newly appointed CIO, is also on the call to answer questions. While we are happy to bring back full year guidance after three years, I'll point out that many macro and business uncertainties remain. I would recommend investors and analysts to focus on 2023 exit run rate to understand the earnings power of this platform and not overly emphasize the calendar year guidance. I have mixed emotions as I reflect back on 2022. As I've described to you in my prior calls, our results frankly underwound our expectation during the first half of the year. While we don't like to fix that on short-term stock performance as we believe, an appropriate window to gauge our performance is at least three to five years, you should so to measure that [ph] for generating an unsatisfactory return -- total return in 2022. But remember, a stock is a fractional ownership of a business and not a ticker. We view our fellow investors as partners for the long haul and continuously strive to improve the prospects for long-term compounding of this business. In spite of some of the headwinds that we experienced in 2022, my team and I are pleased with the underlying improvements we have seen in this platform and our talent base, resulting in a strong rebound of performance in fourth quarter and farther improving momentum being carried into 2023. Our recent progress is only the tip of the iceberg of many of our initiatives, will truly manifest themselves in the year -- next year or two, which I'll go in a minute. While overall macro headwinds persist, we have seen a considerable improvement in the key indicators of the unit economics of the business as reflected by expense per occupied room or EXPOR or revenue per occupied room, or REVPOR. On the expense front, we have seen significant progress on addressing certain challenges we have faced over first year plus, most notably on the agency and temp labor situation. In fact, export has moderated to -- in Q4 to 3.4% driven largely by a deceleration in compensation per occupied room or COMPOR to 2.6%, the lowest level we have seen in our recorded history. At the same time, REVPOR, again, the revenue per occupied room, remain a consistent bright spot for us, increasing 7.5% in Q4, a clear reflection of strong pricing power resulting from our premier locations, product and operator base. As I mentioned on our last call, one of our largest operators pulled forward January rental increases in Q4. Even without that, our Q4 REVPOR would have exceeded 6% plus, reflecting a broad-based strength across our portfolio. And while we achieved record REVPOR growth in 2022 of 5.5%, we expect to surpass this level of growth in 2023. While we achieved an impressive 19% SHOP NOI growth in 2022 and expect circa 20% NOI growth in 2023, I believe we're only at the beginning of a multiyear double-digit NOI growth, resulting from a long runway of occupancy gain, rate growth and operating margin expansion. And despite significant macro uncertainty already weighing on the fundamentals of many other sectors, our confidence in future growth of our business is supported by the need-based nature of our asset class along with a favorable demand-supply backdrop, which is getting better every single day. I'm pleased to report that 2023 is already off to a great start with January move-ins up 16% of our '19 levels, representing a meaningful acceleration from the fourth quarter. Forward-looking indicators are also showing promise in January with our total volume -- tour volume across our senior housing operating portfolio is up 25% year-over-year. I would be completely remiss to ignore perhaps one of the most important milestones in the 53-year history of our company, and that is the Private Letter Ruling we received, which permits us to both own and self manage independent living assets. The PLR provides us significant flexibility in operating our assets, and its timing coincides almost perfectly with the build-out of our industry-leading operating and asset management platform, which John and his team have been tirelessly working on. We remain optimistic that farther investment in our platform will not only result in a better margin profile of our assets, but also will meaningfully benefit the third-party operating partners across the senior living spectrum, who we choose to do business with in the future. We continue to see a tremendous opportunity to professionalize and modernize the operating side of senior living business, following our instinct where there's mystery, there's margin. And our PLR gives a significant ammunition to accelerate the pace for what Welltower 3.0 might look like. I want to thank Mike Garst, our tax team and many others whose efforts have led to this game-changing achievement. Before turning to investing environment, I want to highlight the addition of Retirement Unlimited, or RUI, to Welltower's roster of exceptional operating partner. RUI is one of the best operating performing senior housing operator in the East Coast with the highest program quality programming and care standards. RUI has consistently maintained occupancy levels at north of 90% and with hardly any use of agency lever over past few years. We announced today that RUI has assumed the management of our first community together in Alexandria, Virginia, with plans to meaningfully grow our relationship in near term through acquisitions, transition and development. We are extremely excited and humbled to partner with the Fralin and Waldron families and RUI\u2019s all star President, Doris-Ellie Sullivan, and welcome them to Welltower family. In terms of other growth partners, it was exactly a year ago when we announced our partnership with David and Simon Reuben, along with their acquisition of Avery Healthcare in the UK. As you know, Reuben Brothers is one of the most sophisticated, forward-thinking and well-capitalized global investors with the reputation of attracting best-in-class talent and technology platform. Our thesis was validated when Reuben Brothers attracted Lorna Rose, one of the most well respected operating -- senior housing operating executive in UK to join Avery as the company\u2019s CEO view in December. Lorna has spent 25 years in the industry and was most recently with Barchester, one of the UK's largest senior housing platforms. Next, on the capital allocation side, we have rarely seen a favorable environment across all our product types in all three countries we do business with in. There are 20-plus-billion of exit cue for core real estate funds and then perhaps even a longer one for non-traded REITs. This along with the challenging debt market, give us an enormous advantage to buy the right product at the right location at the right basis. Please note that while we are underrunning by more than $0.5 billion of EBITDA from pre-pandemic levels, we just reported debt metrics that are better than Q4 of 2019, along with more than $5 billion of near-term liquidity -- available liquidity. We have many avenues to access and deploy capital that I've described before, and we remain busy on all fronts. But our North Star remains consistent and simple. We strive to create per share value for our existing owners by compounding over a long period of time within our circle of competence, which we define as the area where we can assess and allocate capital with house odds rather than gambler\u2019s odds. With that, I'll pass it over to John.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh. I'm excited about our operating performance this quarter and the acceleration in growth, which we've witnessed. My first conference call at Welltower was in Q2 of July 2021. Total portfolio same-store NOI was a negative 7.1%. Since that call, the portfolio's performance has continued to improve. In 2022, despite challenges, growth was in the range of 7% to 9% for the Q1 through Q3. However, in Q4, we accelerated a 12.9% portfolio NOI growth driven by senior housing operating business with NOI growth of 28.1%, despite all the challenges of the current economy. This amazing performance is a result of both the fantastic supply-demand dynamics of the senior housing sector and aggressive asset management. I continue to see many opportunities to professionalize the business, which are being proven out through various initiatives as noted in the case studies we presented in the slide deck and clearly come through the financials when looking at the massive improvement in agency labor, which I'll outline in a moment. It is this abundance of opportunity, the opportunity of applying proven industry solutions to the senior housing industry, which led me to chat to my friend, Jerry Davis, and engage Jerry as a Strategic Advisor. As many of you know, during my multifamily days, Jerry was my counterpart at UDR, one of the largest multifamily REITs with the national platform of 60,000 apartment homes. Jerry spent 30 years in various roles at UDR and nearly 15 overseeing all the company's operations before retiring in 2021. He and I have always shared similar views that the operational excellence requires a focus on people, processes, data and technology, which, if well done, results in a superior experience for both residents and employees and ultimately drives stronger financial performance. We have made substantial headway over the past 1.5-year in enhancing our management capabilities, and Jerry's expertise will accelerate that progress. He\u2019ll focus his efforts on specific opportunities while I\u2019ll continue to build the broader operating platform from asset management and operations to capital, resource management, renovation, et cetera, as Welltower transforms the business. Jerry will help us to continue accelerate -- continue to accelerate change in the senior housing industry. Our work together will not simply be additive, it will be exponential, J squared. Now, I'll provide some insight into our operating business, starting with the medical office portfolio. In the fourth quarter, same-store NOI growth for our outpatient medical business was 2.1% over the prior year's quarter. Same-store occupancy was steady throughout the year at nearly 95%, while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at 93% for the second straight quarter and nearly 92% for the entire year. This robust retention rate helps us drive improved lease rates and continued strong re-leasing rates. Turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. The 28.1% fourth quarter NOI increase over the prior year's quarter was driven by revenue growth of 10.3% for the period. Year-over-year margin growth of 320 basis points was also the strongest of the year. All three regions showed strong revenue growth, starting with Canada at 6.6%, the U.S. and the UK, an impressive 10.6% and 19.2%, respectively. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by a 200 basis-point increase in average occupancy and another quarter of healthy pricing power with REVPOR growth of 7.5%, which, as Shankh mentioned, is the highest we've ever witnessed. Sequentially, portfolio average occupancy continued to improve with a gain of 20 basis points during the period. Turning to expenses. Agency use has obviously been a key factor in 2022 expenses. However, in Q4 2022, just as Tim had mentioned many times, agency expense is acting as an expense deflator. Agency in our same-store portfolio is down 44% year-over-year in Q4 '22. We often quote agency as a percentage of compensation. So looking at it that way, in Q4 of 2021, agency expense was 6.9% of compensation and in Q4 of 2022, it was 3.7%. Regardless of how you look at agency, the expense is declining in the U.S. and Canada, where over 90% of our senior housing portfolio is located. The UK is still impacted by overall labor shortage as well as some rigid staffing models, which have led to lower occupancy properties being overstaffed. Management in the UK is slowly adjusting to a dynamic staffing model, ensuring appropriate staffing at various levels of occupancy. Overall, COMPOR, the compensation per occupied room, which represents about 60% of the expense per occupied room, increased only 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter, which is the lowest growth rate in over five years. This moderating COMPOR growth helped drive the deceleration in overall expense growth, despite continued inflationary pressures in several line items, including food and utilities, which rose 10.5% and 10%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2022 on a per occupied room basis compared to the prior year's quarter. Food and utilities represent roughly 12% of expense per occupied room. The combination of 7.5% REVPOR growth, the highest in over five years with a 3.4% expense POR growth led to remarkable growth rate in net operating income per occupied unit of 25%. Regarding our operating platform, we continue to be on pace to pilot our first module in Q1 '23, with several other modules in the works. I must say that I'm purposefully not giving out the details as they're proprietary. However, I will say that I'm proud of the creative accomplishments of the Welltower team and I'm grateful for the wonderful operators that we are partnering with on these first modules. The successes that we have had through aggressive asset management, as noted in the slide deck, are the result of brute force and prove the opportunity. Operational excellence is achieved by a focus on people, processes, data and technology, and that is exactly what the team has done and the various initiatives that are outlined in three case studies on agency labor reduction, revenue management and care revenue. We will continue to leverage our team to drive results, yet the greatest opportunity will be realized as we roll out the operating platform in the coming years. Finally, I would like to thank our operators and all their employees and the Welltower employees for making these results possible. Our teamwork has clearly paid off, leading to improved resident and employee experiences and stronger overall results. I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\nTim McHugh: Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on the fourth quarter 2022 results, the performance of our triple-net investment segment in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet liquidity update, and finally, our outlook for the year ahead. Welltower reported fourth quarter normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per diluted share, representing 7% year-over-year growth after adjusting for prior period government grants and FX headwinds. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth in the quarter of 12.9% year-over-year. Before getting into our segment results, I want to provide an update on our recently closed ProMedica restructure and the go-forward reporting treatment. In late December, we announced the closing of our restructure joint venture with ProMedica Health System and our newly formed joint venture with Integra Health. The ProMedica Health System JV consisting of 58 private pay assisted living assets will continue to be operated under a lease with ProMedica Health System and it is now part of our senior housing triple-net reporting segment. The Integra Health joint venture, consisting of 147 skilled nursing properties, comprised of a property joint venture and a master lease with Integra Health. The lease commenced upon closing in December adds to the first tranche of the property JV with Integra acquiring 15% of Welltower's stake in 54 of the assets for $73 million. As previously expected, subsequent to year-end, the second tranche of assets closed in January, Integra acquired 15% interest in another 31 assets for $74 million. The remaining 52 assets are expected to close in the second half of the year. As for the underlying operations, the subleasing of the portfolio is progressing in line with expectations. 75% of the beds have already transition management with the remainder of the portfolio waiting on state specific approvals. We will continue to update the market as the progress of management transitions in addition to underlying property level fundamentals. Now turning to the performance of the rest of our triple net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. These statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 9/30/2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 4.3% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.86 times in the quarter. Next, same-store NOI in our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 4% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.34 times in the quarter. Turning to capital market activity. In the quarter, we settled $1.5 billion of previously raised equity through our forward ATM program, helping to bring debt to EBITDA down to 6.3 times at year-end, a substantial decrease of nearly 7 times at year-end 2021 and below pre-COVID levels of Q4 2019. For the year, we settled a total of $3.7 billion of equity to fund $3.7 billion of net investment activity, allowing us to continue to deploy capital into a desiccated private market while materially delevering the balance sheet. Looking forward, we ended the year with $722 million of cash, full capacity on our $4 billion revolving line of credit and $383 million in expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan pay-downs, representing $5.1 billion in near-term available liquidity. Before moving on to our 2023 guidance, I wanted to add more context to Shankh's earlier commentary around the opportunity provided to our company by last year's Private Letter Ruling. Nearly 14 years ago, Welltower structured first day of management agreement, giving a direct economic exposure to senior housing operations. Over the last five-plus years, we built a better and stronger alignment within this contractual structure, ultimately reaching a point in 2021, where we can generate meaningful ROI through centralized human capital and technology investment at Welltower. We hired John Burkart and started to build the team around him. The PLR we received last year allowed us to meaningfully accelerate that effort as the ROI friction is entirely removed under self-management. This Welltower platform investment is evident through G&A. With greater than 80% of our expected year-over-year increase in overhead costs being driven by technology investment and new position additions in '22 and '23, focused primarily on asset management, data analytics and technology. We continue to believe that the opportunity to both modernize operations and drive efficiencies through scale in our business is vast and creates a sustainably strong cash flow tailwind when combined with the demographic-driven demand of the next decade plus. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance, which we are reintroducing for the first time since COVID uncertainty began impacting our business in March of 2020. Last night, we provided an outlook for 2023 of net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.57 to $0.75 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.35 to $3.53 per diluted share or $3.54 at the midpoint. As mentioned in the release, our 2023 guidance contemplates no adjustments for other government grants we receive in the year. So, after adjusting for $0.07 of nonrecurring government grants received in 2022, we are guiding for 5% year-over-year growth. This year-over-year increase in FFO is composed of $0.36 from growth in our senior housing operating portfolio and $0.03 from growth across the rest of our segments. These are offset by $0.04 of prior mentioned higher G&A and Welltower platform costs and $0.19 of floating rate interest and foreign exchange headwinds. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8% to 13%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%, long-term post-cute 2% to 3%, and senior housing triple-net of 1% to 3%, and finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 24%, the midpoint of which is driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.5%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 230 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth of approximately 6.25. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. While we ended 2022 on a positive note, it was also a year of sheer grit and perseverance from our team. As we face different challenges in our business, be it the expense pressure, development cost pressure or ProMedica, we remain steadfast in our belief that our job as stewards of our shareholders' capital is to solve problems when we encounter on this journey and not rip the band aid off and give away potential future upside to private equity -- to profit from either because, one, it is the easiest thing to do instead of working things out or two, the feeling on instant gratification as Wall Street tends to cheer such decisions. We see too many market participants mix up short-term volatility with long-term risk apartment capital loss. As our partners in the business, our investors can count on us to take tough road to deliver strongest returns we believe are achievable when we face challenges. This is evident in the build-out of our operating platform and our transaction with ProMedica and Integra. To paraphrase Mr. Munger, you can rest assured that we have a deferred gratification gene imprinted all over our culture, and we remind ourselves every day that big money is made not in buying and selling, but in winning. Lastly, I'm extremely delighted to see many of my partners recently appointed to the executive and senior management roles within the organization, developing the business fighting it together in the trenches, and I'm convinced that we have the deepest bench strength along with the longest runway as I look across the real estate space. Supplementing this talent is our unmatched data and machine learning capabilities, which allows us to efficiently and cost effectively evaluate new investments as well as reinvestment in our portfolio. In addition to our strength of our existing team, we continue to attract best-in-class talent from outside the industry who share our belief that the future of our business may look very different from the past. Simply said, we want to attract talent that comes from the industries with high standards. And to that point, I could not be happier that John has convinced Jerry Davis to join our team. As you all know from his many years in multifamily sector, Jerry has one of the sharpest operating minds in real estate. I have known and admired Jerry for 15 years and cannot be more excited to work with him and learn from him. I'm more convinced than ever that John along with Jerry will have an exponential impact and transform this industry. If you are or know someone of that operating caliber and more importantly have an outsider\u2019s mindset from a related or frankly unrelated industry who wants to join the formidable team of J squared, please let us know. Welltower is wide open for business, not only for asset acquisition but also for talent acquisition. With that, I'll open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Jonathan Hughes at Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: I just wanted to ask about the increasing operator relationships. Obviously, we just saw another one yesterday with RUI and you talked about more opportunities -- or expected opportunities in the future. But I'm wondering what the landscape looks like after three years of these pandemic headwinds? How many high-quality operators remain as an opportunity that you don't already have a relationship with and what's the size of those individual opportunities? Are they smaller or larger in terms of investment volume than the relationships established over the past few years? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. Jonathan, you asked a very, very good question. So, as I think about -- if your question is specific to senior housing industry, I see that -- obviously, we have most of the operating partners that want to do business which we already do business with. So expansion of new operating partners is less of a focus and going deep rather than going broad is our focus. We are looking for striving for regional density with our existing partners across the different countries, right? Now, we have, I mentioned before that we have -- there are operating partners in the business, there are operators in the business that we have admired for a very long period of time. And this is a long dating process. It takes a long time for both parties to understand how we can add value to each other, right? Capital is a commodity. Just capital, us bringing capital to an operating partner, frankly speaking, in any relationship is not enough. And for our perspective, so we bring in data analytics and other operating platform initiatives that John is doing to the equation. At the same time, we want to understand whether these operating partners are thinking about the business or where the business is going 10, 20 years from now, not where the business was 10, 20 years ago, right? There's a significant mind shift that is needed in the business. And frankly speaking, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we need higher standards, higher standards of employee engagement, higher standards of customer service and higher standard of how we treat capital and what we -- and how we deliver results for the capital. And those are the type of operating partners and business partners that we're looking for, and we're grateful that we have a fundamentally a fantastic roster of these people to drive business with. Now going to the second part of your question, from an investment volume standpoint, I want to reemphasize, you're going to see a majority of the investment volume with existing partners as well as sort of the partners that we have already announced in the last couple of -- two, three years.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Griffin at Citi.\nMichael Griffin: Maybe just on transaction activity. I mean, Shankh, I know you've always talked about how you're an unlevered IRR focused investor. I'm curious if you've seen any change and maybe hurdle or return rates that might get you more excited about one property type relative to another. I know you seem pretty positive in your opening comments, but any additional clarity there would be helpful.\nShankh Mitra: Michael, if you think about -- different times give us opportunities for different types of product. You have seen us buy and sell every product that we own in last, call it, 7 years, 8 years under this -- under the leadership of this team, right? So, because different times, you get opportunities to buy different products at a very favorable basis. This might be the first time we're seeing across all our product type, across the three countries that we do business with, we're seeing opportunities, right? This is a very, very disruptive time from not only from debt side but also from equity side. The people who we normally compete against, right, the core funds, the non-traded REITs and others, everybody is facing very significant flow -- outflow, either because of the denominator effect that you see in pension fund world as well institutional world or some other reasons such as availability of -- not availability of debt and other situations. So, we're seeing across all product types, we're seeing very significant opportunities -- and frankly speaking, an ability to achieve IRRs that we haven't seen in some of the product types, frankly, forever.\nOperator: We'll move next to Jeff Dennerlein (sic) [Josh Dennerlein] at Bank of America.\nJosh Dennerlein: I appreciate all the color on the asset management platform. Just kind of curious how we should be thinking about kind of is this like the full investment year and then payoffs start happening in 2024? Is there anything kind of built into guidance as far as like a payoff -- and how are we thinking about the J squared run rate for returns?\nJohn Burkart: Yes. I'll start and Tim may want to comment. I'm not definitely -- for clarity, not commenting on Tim's guidance. But, I think what we're seeing and what we're trying to show is the returns are already coming through. I mean, if you look at what's going on from an aggressive asset management perspective, you see that in the agency move and what the team has done, which is tremendous amount of blocking and tackling. The additional work that we're doing really relates to scaling those things. And partly why we included that in the deck is I came in and I had a view of things from my gut, you might say, so to speak. And I probed around and got confirmation, and then we started workflows and now that that's proving out, and that's what we wanted to show because that is critical. We were right. There is tremendous opportunity here. And the more I got into it, the more opportunity I see. When you look at J squared, this exponential opportunity, it's huge. My view is where I'm working right now is across the whole platform, as I mentioned, and Jerry will be able to focus in on individual items and execute highest of all levels, which will speed up our process. So bottom-line is we're already delivering numbers. It will continue for many, many years and it ultimately relates to significant margin improvement across the board.\nTim McHugh: I'll just add on cost. We look at this as an investment, right, on the human capital side and on the technology side. So, you know that we run our platform very efficiently, and we don't take the costs lightly as far as any further investment. But we think there's a lot of return here on investment. And so, there is a bit of a lag between dollars in and hires, in that return. But on a go-forward basis, I expect us to be very prudent about it and continue to show high return for dollars spent.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Mike Mueller at JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller: Hi. I\u2019m curious what's the range of margins that you think the SHO business could operate at full occupancy, and to use your term, when it's fully professionalized?\nShankh Mitra: Mike, I was just not going to sit here and try to speculate what might or might not happen, but I will repeat what I've said before. If we went back to pre-COVID occupancy and pre-COVID margin, I will be really disappointed. If that's where we end, we'll be disappointed.\nOperator: We'll go next to Derek Johnston at Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: In addition to the REIT community, a lot of generalist investors are closely following WELL. So, I know we touched on it in the opening, but can you expand on this favorable Private Letter Ruling with the IRS. I think around 45,000 independent living units are not really being designated as healthcare facilities and/or subject to RDEA. [Ph] And so what does that mean, right? And importantly, how the decision may drive further earnings growth, especially given the beefed-up asset platform? Thanks.\nJohn Burkart: Yes. I'll touch on that. So, what it means, I think the easiest way to look at it is if you just go back and read history a little bit and you look at the multifamily world when everyone kind of came together in the mid-'90s when I started -- where I was at. And what you saw is this move from fee managers to owner operators was a fundamental shift. And what I think a lot of people missed was there was a basic economics behind that. In essence, as a fee manager, you get paid a percentage, let's say, 5% to collect $1, and that means you wouldn't spend more than $0.05 to collect the dollar; as an owner operator you paid $1 to collect $1, so that's -- you would spend $0.99 to collect $1. And so that fundamental shift enabled us as owner operators to move much, much faster and changed how we looked at the world, whether it be investing in websites, technology, et cetera, or bringing things in-house, marketing in-house, et cetera. All these things enabled a tremendous improvement in margins. And that's what it ultimately means is it will allow us to step into that business and have tremendous impact on the margins. More than that, I would say, I break the business down into three components overall. There's a real estate or multifamily component. There's what I call the hospitality component, which relates to meals, housekeeping activities, and then there's a care component. And so, our various residential businesses have one to three of those parts. So, as we step in, we address the real estate as well as this hospitality component at our independent living, we'll be able to take those best practices and move those into the assisted living, which we're obviously not managing. But if we find better ways, more effective ways to deliver higher quality meal service, et cetera, that will all be pushed out through our platform, no different than what we're doing right now in our case study on revenue management, how we push that out to one of the assisted living properties. So, the same concept will apply. So, this is pretty huge, and it will impact our overall residential platform.\nShankh Mitra: I'll just add, Derek, one thing to that. Just as I mentioned before, we're working towards regional density and going deep and not going broad with our existing partners, right? So, think about it, I don't know, just -- you will see the future is with our select operating partners, strategic partners, we're going to have bigger density or higher density and a bigger scale in a market and with our investment in the technology platform and the operating platform with our operating partners, the ability to execute on the ground I think, again, this is going to be not only a great win for our owners, our assets, but also a great win for the select operated partners that we'll choose to do business with going forward. So, it is a very much of a focus on win-win, and that's the way business got to be.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Carroll at RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: How has Welltower's relationship changed with its existing independent living operators since the PLR announcement? I mean, are they more willing to work with Welltower, given certain goals or targets, or has there been any noticeable change since that was announced?\nShankh Mitra: The forward thinking ones who are thinking about where the business needs to go 10 years from now, 5 years from now, 15 years from now, has come forward and want to participate in building out the platform together. The ones that are holding on to the notion of what the business was in the \u201890s are clearly realizing their future is not with us.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Ronald Kamdem at Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Adam on for Ron. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask about the ProMedica, Integra assets. Wondering kind of with the new operators in place there for some of them, if you could kind of comment on the rent coverage, I'm not sure if it was in the supplemental. I know there's some changes there in terms of the reporting structure. So I'd love to just hear about the rent coverage. I think it would be helpful for investors kind of given the kind of the prior history there.\nJohn Burkart: Look, I think with the new operators, we've transitioned to at least 16 operators so far. And by the time the dust settles, it will be north of 20 operators. But all these transitions have happened over the last month, 1.5-month. So, it's too soon to have numbers and performance conversations about their performance, but overall transitions have been smooth. And in the upcoming months, we'll have better data to share on performance trends. But for now, the focus has been on getting the buildings in the right hands. And as you'll see, with 16 to 20 operators that the focus has been very deep and very sharpshooter-esque where you want to find for every single asset, the right operator. So, that's been the top priority so far.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Shankh, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the investment opportunities that you're sort of seeing out there? And sort of the distress in the system, you guys were obviously very active last year. I'm just curious what it takes to sort of shake the tree and how the returns might have changed kind of looking forward on the new deals?\nShankh Mitra: Steve, I don't think I have much to add. Maybe Nikhil has something to add after I'm done. I would just tell you that this is sort of the only time I've seen where there's opportunity in all three product types across all three countries, right? You usually don't see that. And that's driven by -- last couple of years have been primarily debt driven, right? So, we have seen a lot of opportunities in the IRR. So, we have done senior housing 9%, call it circa, 9%, some higher, some lower, but call it around 9%. Historically, I've said medical office is an interesting business to buy or interesting space to invest around, call it, 7-plus unlevered IRR. Finally, we're seeing opportunities in 8-plus level. And on the wellness side, where the cap rates have been very, very tight, IRRs have been in the 6s, we're finally seeing they're in the high-7s, right? So, that's sort of, I would say, where the different investment landscape where we're seeing opportunities, but depends on -- some are obviously higher. We're still seeing some double-digit opportunities. But I will tell you the other thing is because it's not just debt driven but also equity driven, most of the stuff that we have bought in last couple of years, we're fundamentally focused on right location, right product, right basis. And we have bought lots of assets with no cash flow, negative cash flow. And finally, we're seeing because people have to transact, right, what's happening, we are seeing opportunities that with very good bases, with very good locations, assets are also starting to come with cash flow. That's sort of, I will say, the slight change in nuance of the investment landscape. But I don't know, Nikhil you want to add anything?\nJohn Burkart: And I think the other thing I'll add is we just go through a lot of pain and effort to try and be the highest quality counterparty for someone to deal with. Whether it is the speed of execution, whether it is across the time frame of a transaction sticking with what we started off saying initially, the deal was, and in times like these, it just makes us the preferred counterparty. And so, there's a lot of recognition for that across the Street. And it's times like these that we really are able to shine. So, very excited about our pipeline for the year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rich Anderson at SMBC.\nRich Anderson: If I could just -- on the PLR, very, very interesting indeed -- just some thoughts around it. Does this mean that we should see sort of a pace of investment from you guys to bring managers in-house for what you have currently? And how much of the IL portfolio that you have today didn't qualify? Will there be cut changes there to have them pass the test so that they also can qualify for the PLR ruling? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So I'll take the second part. Think about we have independent living at a standalone, for example, Holiday Atria portfolio as well as our Canada portfolio. That's roughly, I would say, 2/3 to 3/4 of the independent living that we own that obviously qualifies. How this relates to, when independent living is a part of the continuum, we will figure that out. Most importantly, I want to focus on what I said before that you will see with our forward thinking select operators who have density, you will see that we will -- building out the platform, right? John has mentioned very clearly that he is building out the platform with our best operators, right? This is not a question of what part will do in-house versus in what part we'll do with operator. We have also another 15,000, 20,000 units in the wellness housing sector there, which obviously we always could have done in-house, right? So, this is finding the right balance of retail density with all the products that are out there region, and bringing in-house where we have the density versus -- or keeping it outside when our partners have density. So, the game is not to who does what. This is not a fight of just because we do something, we'll do it better. The main goal is with our operating partners build this operating platform to the highest quality technology and systems and processes and data to deliver the best outcome for our residents as well as frankly, employee experience. John, do you want to add anything to that?\nJohn Burkart: Yes. I mean, that's said perfectly. And I would just add in a sense of the speed, you can only imagine we're moving and we have been moving extremely fast to address the opportunities that we see. We'll definitely build on success. It's not exactly -- what Shankh's saying, it's not about going out and trying to control everything, it\u2019s about creating success that drives value to all the various stakeholders. So, that's where our heads are at. And in the end, there'll be a little bit of the lag in the sense of where we spend money on G&A versus where we start to offset that because of reduced fees because we're just moving it like the multifamily, moving the property management services on to the book. So, a little bit of a lag there, but ultimately, it will offset and the improvement will be in margins.\nOperator: We'll go next to Juan Sanabria at BMO.\nJuan Sanabria: Just wanted to hit on the SHO -- same-store NOI growth guidance Shankh, I think you mentioned in your opening remarks about the exit run rate and focusing on that. So maybe hoping you can provide a little color there? And should we assume that there's any incremental transitions in '23? You mentioned RUI having growing -- going forward through transitions as well. So just curious if you could maybe just comment on those two moving pieces.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. Thanks, Juan. So the transition piece, we'll start with that. There is not a contemplation of further transitions in our guidance. So, our first quarter has about 85% of our open and operating buildings as of 12/31. Our first quarter has 85% of that same-store and that grows to mid-90s. So on average, kind of 90% of the open and operating assets in that pool. What was the first question?\nJuan Sanabria: The cadence of the exit run rate.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So, if you think about it, we're building occupancy, right? You know that Q1 is sort of the weaker point in the occupancy spectrum, and you build occupancy -- occupancy growth happens through spring and summer. So your occupancy build on an average basis, you get closer to sort of that Q3, Q4 level where you get a better revenue, if you will, right, sort of in that annual journey. Now, think about expenses, which are also coming down, right? So you have -- you probably have a better -- significantly better exit run rate in Q4 than Q1, right? So following both revenue as well as expenses. Think about how other situation that I've described before, I think the last call, maybe the one before, is how REVPOR builds, right? You move your rents on a bunch of people at the beginning of the year and as well as our -- for our portfolio, just call it, half and half. We also have a very large operator who moved in Q4, but just think through how that plays out. And then you chase that in-place rent through your market rent, which is also going up for the year. So, if you think about from an occupancy, from rates, from expense improvements, which is we're glad that agency cost is down from, call it, 7 to sub 4. We were very unhappy. It's still sub 4. It should be significantly lower than that. So if you think through all of the main drivers, you're going to get a much higher exit run rate in Q4 than Q1.\nOperator: We'll move next to John Pawlowski at Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: John Burkart, could you just give me a sense for how much more pushback your operators are seeing on rent increases today than in recent quarters, so they've had no issue pushing rents? And if there's any segments of the portfolio that are starting to hit a wall just in terms of absolute rents? Any color there would be appreciated.\nJohn Burkart: Yes. No, glad to. I'm not aware of any pushback. It's not to say, of course, when a rent increase goes out, there's not a discussion. But in the sense of defining pushback as a market response to that, no, I'm not aware of that. I think, the -- our partners have done a phenomenal job of communicating the increases and the reasons behind those increases. And I think our residents understand that they don't want to see important services and care cut. They want to have what they paid for, the best of that, and we're just not aware of any issues there.\nShankh Mitra: John, as I mentioned, I expect REVPOR increase to be better in '23 than '22. So, that sort of gives you -- we'll see what the market gives us. But as we sit here today, we think the pricing environment is getting better.\nOperator: We'll move next to Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: Just maybe building upon the pricing power, maybe Shankh or John, if you can just elaborate. You talked about the exit run rate, earnings run rate sort of as a guide to the earnings power. Can you talk about both on pricing and say, CapEx, as you see inflation come in, your costs come in, your maybe ability to push higher rates. You said near term is not hampered. But as you see inflation come in, but occupancy is still low, can you just give us some context on how you see pricing power evolving until occupancy recovers? And then, similarly, CapEx-wise, after 2, 3 years of COVID, what do you need to invest from a run rate standpoint, maybe percent of NOI? Is there an uptick needed over the next few years on CapEx? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Let me try that. So first on CapEx I do not believe, other than inflationary changes, anything change from a CapEx standpoint, right? So just understand that we bought predominantly in the last two, three years, new assets. We bought one or two portfolio as the value-add portfolio. And when we bought it, for example, the Holiday Atria portfolio, we told you exactly what we underwrote to spend on CapEx, right? We bought in an extremely cheap basis. And we told you exactly what that CapEx needs are and how we plan to invest. So from that perspective, as you think about going forward, I do not believe -- outside those couple of value-add investments that we have done, and we told you otherwise, when we have done it, we do not believe the business\u2019s CapEx needs outside the sort of inflationary increases that are happening anything has changed. Now, I think John has a very large plan, a very big plan to reamenitize the portfolio and sort of fundamentally changing what the value proposition might look like. Obviously, we'll do that if think that we're getting fantastic return on that incremental investment. But from a regular CapEx perspective, I don't think anything has changed. From a pricing power standpoint, I don't think -- what else I can add other than to what I said to John's question and the earlier question, which is we are feeling very good about the pricing power across all our countries and across all our product types. As you know that Canada has been a laggard, feels like Canada is starting to catch up. UK and U.S. has been strong and continue to be strong. So, we're feeling pretty good. John, do you want to add anything to that?\nJohn Burkart: Yes. I mean, again, I would just say, on the value-add side, this is purely opportunistic. I mean, I just look at the world and see our portfolio is positioned so well to come with another layer of value-add opportunities because of the age of the portfolio, which are really the highest returns because the infrastructure is all in great shape. And so, you're talking about what some people would call fluff and buff, but reamenitize, enhancing the units a little bit really improving that value proposition and getting paid very well for it, very much similar to what many of the multi have done, so. But that's all enhanced the returns.\nShankh Mitra: Vikram, I missed one part of your question. I'll just tell you that from a pricing power standpoint, this is something I mentioned in the last call that we are -- despite our average occupancy of the portfolio, call it, circa 80%, there's a significant part of the portfolio, call it, give or take, half of the portfolio, 45% of the portfolio is in that high-80s, mid- to high-80% occupancy. There, the pricing power changes to raising price because have no rooms to sell, right? So there is a dynamic that's going on and increasingly we'll get to the point as we move average occupancy for the portfolio, more and more properties within the bucket that you will get to that pricing power because, frankly, you have no room to sell. So that transition is happening and will continue to happen in '23.\nOperator: We'll take a follow-up from Michael Griffin at Citi.\nMichael Griffin: I just wanted a clarifying question. I don't recall if I heard this earlier, but on the assets that continue to be operated by ProMedica, the assisted living and memory care. What is the coverage on those? Do you happen to have that handy?\nTim McHugh: Yes. Those are covered one-times on EBITDA basis.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Derek Johnston at Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: \u2026won't make the habit of it. But on staffing levels, at 80% occupancy in senior housing, I believe that's near fully staffed, and please correct me if I'm wrong. But the question is, what are you modeling or including in guidance for '23 relative to agency labor as a percentage of labor expenses? And do you view this as possible low-hanging fruit to get back to pre-pandemic levels of agency especially as John and the team increase property level accountability.\nShankh Mitra: Let me try to take part of that and Tim will take part of that question. So, we do not view this as a low-hanging fruit, but we do view this as a fruit that can be plucked, right? So there's a lot of effort that's going on. Tim will tell you what's modeled. Frankly, I don't know. But I will tell you that this is -- agency labor is a function of, frankly, weak management. That's just what it is, weak leadership. And we're working with our best-in-class operators to get the right people in the right place so that we should, over a period of time, see that improvement. As I've said, coming below 4% is an achievement when you start from 9%, but by no means, I want you to think that I'm actually happy with that number. That number needs to be substantially lower. And we need to really get full-time employees in the communities. This is not just a question of cost, but also, as John alluded to, it's also a question of culture and the customer experience.\nTim McHugh: From a modeling perspective, we're essentially in the high-3s as a percentage of compensation. So pretty flat from where we came out of 2022.\nOperator: We'll move next to John Pawlowski at Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. I just had one follow-up on the Private Letter Ruling. I guess what else needs to happen internally in terms of people, systems, technology before you're actually able to self operate a substantial amount of IL units? I'm just curious how quickly we could actually see Welltower operate these assets.\nJohn Burkart: Yes. So, I'll comment on what would need to happen, but not necessarily the speed at which. But if you look at it, I mean, one way to look at it is really just to simplify the world a lot and to say what would happen when a company -- from my past experience, when the two companies merge, you look and say, okay, if I step into their systems and start to fly the plane with what they have, that could happen pretty fast, right? That's not that complex. And so, the timing of it could be -- can be faster if we wanted it to be faster by stepping in that way. Obviously, what -- going back to what we're building, as I've mentioned previously, we're using largely existing modules. There's some creative stuff going on right now with the team. But generally, it's existing modules that are out there. And so, that doesn't take that long either. So, the speed can go fairly fast. The bigger issue is we're focused on success, and we're focused on working with people to deliver the success. It's not about us necessarily doing it. It's about us delivering success for all the stakeholders. So, that's where my mind is at. But the speed could go pretty fast.\nShankh Mitra: It will not surprise me to see that we start to self manage some assets -- some IL assets in calendar year 2023.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. And that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. I'm excited about our operating performance this quarter and the acceleration in growth, which we've witnessed. My first conference call at Welltower was in Q2 of July 2021. Total portfolio same-store NOI was a negative 7.1%. Since that call, the portfolio's performance has continued to improve. In 2022, despite challenges, growth was in the range of 7% to 9% for the Q1 through Q3. However, in Q4, we accelerated a 12.9% portfolio NOI growth driven by senior housing operating business with NOI growth of 28.1%, despite all the challenges of the current economy. This amazing performance is a result of both the fantastic supply-demand dynamics of the senior housing sector and aggressive asset management. I continue to see many opportunities to professionalize the business, which are being proven out through various initiatives as noted in the case studies we presented in the slide deck and clearly come through the financials when looking at the massive improvement in agency labor, which I'll outline in a moment. It is this abundance of opportunity, the opportunity of applying proven industry solutions to the senior housing industry, which led me to chat to my friend, Jerry Davis, and engage Jerry as a Strategic Advisor. As many of you know, during my multifamily days, Jerry was my counterpart at UDR, one of the largest multifamily REITs with the national platform of 60,000 apartment homes. Jerry spent 30 years in various roles at UDR and nearly 15 overseeing all the company's operations before retiring in 2021. He and I have always shared similar views that the operational excellence requires a focus on people, processes, data and technology, which, if well done, results in a superior experience for both residents and employees and ultimately drives stronger financial performance. We have made substantial headway over the past 1.5-year in enhancing our management capabilities, and Jerry's expertise will accelerate that progress. He'll focus his efforts on specific opportunities while I'll continue to build the broader operating platform from asset management and operations to capital, resource management, renovation, et cetera, as Welltower transforms the business. Jerry will help us to continue accelerate -- continue to accelerate change in the senior housing industry. Our work together will not simply be additive, it will be exponential, J squared. Now, I'll provide some insight into our operating business, starting with the medical office portfolio. In the fourth quarter, same-store NOI growth for our outpatient medical business was 2.1% over the prior year's quarter. Same-store occupancy was steady throughout the year at nearly 95%, while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at 93% for the second straight quarter and nearly 92% for the entire year. This robust retention rate helps us drive improved lease rates and continued strong re-leasing rates. Turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. The 28.1% fourth quarter NOI increase over the prior year's quarter was driven by revenue growth of 10.3% for the period. Year-over-year margin growth of 320 basis points was also the strongest of the year. All three regions showed strong revenue growth, starting with Canada at 6.6%, the U.S. and the UK, an impressive 10.6% and 19.2%, respectively. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by a 200 basis-point increase in average occupancy and another quarter of healthy pricing power with REVPOR growth of 7.5%, which, as Shankh mentioned, is the highest we've ever witnessed. Sequentially, portfolio average occupancy continued to improve with a gain of 20 basis points during the period. Turning to expenses. Agency use has obviously been a key factor in 2022 expenses. However, in Q4 2022, just as Tim had mentioned many times, agency expense is acting as an expense deflator. Agency in our same-store portfolio is down 44% year-over-year in Q4 '22. We often quote agency as a percentage of compensation. So looking at it that way, in Q4 of 2021, agency expense was 6.9% of compensation and in Q4 of 2022, it was 3.7%. Regardless of how you look at agency, the expense is declining in the U.S. and Canada, where over 90% of our senior housing portfolio is located. The UK is still impacted by overall labor shortage as well as some rigid staffing models, which have led to lower occupancy properties being overstaffed. Management in the UK is slowly adjusting to a dynamic staffing model, ensuring appropriate staffing at various levels of occupancy. Overall, COMPOR, the compensation per occupied room, which represents about 60% of the expense per occupied room, increased only 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter, which is the lowest growth rate in over five years. This moderating COMPOR growth helped drive the deceleration in overall expense growth, despite continued inflationary pressures in several line items, including food and utilities, which rose 10.5% and 10%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2022 on a per occupied room basis compared to the prior year's quarter. Food and utilities represent roughly 12% of expense per occupied room. The combination of 7.5% REVPOR growth, the highest in over five years with a 3.4% expense POR growth led to remarkable growth rate in net operating income per occupied unit of 25%. Regarding our operating platform, we continue to be on pace to pilot our first module in Q1 '23, with several other modules in the works. I must say that I'm purposefully not giving out the details as they're proprietary. However, I will say that I'm proud of the creative accomplishments of the Welltower team and I'm grateful for the wonderful operators that we are partnering with on these first modules. The successes that we have had through aggressive asset management, as noted in the slide deck, are the result of brute force and prove the opportunity. Operational excellence is achieved by a focus on people, processes, data and technology, and that is exactly what the team has done and the various initiatives that are outlined in three case studies on agency labor reduction, revenue management and care revenue. We will continue to leverage our team to drive results, yet the greatest opportunity will be realized as we roll out the operating platform in the coming years. Finally, I would like to thank our operators and all their employees and the Welltower employees for making these results possible. Our teamwork has clearly paid off, leading to improved resident and employee experiences and stronger overall results. I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Yes. I'll start and Tim may want to comment. I'm not definitely -- for clarity, not commenting on Tim's guidance. But, I think what we're seeing and what we're trying to show is the returns are already coming through. I mean, if you look at what's going on from an aggressive asset management perspective, you see that in the agency move and what the team has done, which is tremendous amount of blocking and tackling. The additional work that we're doing really relates to scaling those things. And partly why we included that in the deck is I came in and I had a view of things from my gut, you might say, so to speak. And I probed around and got confirmation, and then we started workflows and now that that's proving out, and that's what we wanted to show because that is critical. We were right. There is tremendous opportunity here. And the more I got into it, the more opportunity I see. When you look at J squared, this exponential opportunity, it's huge. My view is where I'm working right now is across the whole platform, as I mentioned, and Jerry will be able to focus in on individual items and execute highest of all levels, which will speed up our process. So bottom-line is we're already delivering numbers. It will continue for many, many years and it ultimately relates to significant margin improvement across the board. Yes. I'll touch on that. So, what it means, I think the easiest way to look at it is if you just go back and read history a little bit and you look at the multifamily world when everyone kind of came together in the mid-'90s when I started -- where I was at. And what you saw is this move from fee managers to owner operators was a fundamental shift. And what I think a lot of people missed was there was a basic economics behind that. In essence, as a fee manager, you get paid a percentage, let's say, 5% to collect $1, and that means you wouldn't spend more than $0.05 to collect the dollar; as an owner operator you paid $1 to collect $1, so that's -- you would spend $0.99 to collect $1. And so that fundamental shift enabled us as owner operators to move much, much faster and changed how we looked at the world, whether it be investing in websites, technology, et cetera, or bringing things in-house, marketing in-house, et cetera. All these things enabled a tremendous improvement in margins. And that's what it ultimately means is it will allow us to step into that business and have tremendous impact on the margins. More than that, I would say, I break the business down into three components overall. There's a real estate or multifamily component. There's what I call the hospitality component, which relates to meals, housekeeping activities, and then there's a care component. And so, our various residential businesses have one to three of those parts. So, as we step in, we address the real estate as well as this hospitality component at our independent living, we'll be able to take those best practices and move those into the assisted living, which we're obviously not managing. But if we find better ways, more effective ways to deliver higher quality meal service, et cetera, that will all be pushed out through our platform, no different than what we're doing right now in our case study on revenue management, how we push that out to one of the assisted living properties. So, the same concept will apply. So, this is pretty huge, and it will impact our overall residential platform. Look, I think with the new operators, we've transitioned to at least 16 operators so far. And by the time the dust settles, it will be north of 20 operators. But all these transitions have happened over the last month, 1.5-month. So, it's too soon to have numbers and performance conversations about their performance, but overall transitions have been smooth. And in the upcoming months, we'll have better data to share on performance trends. But for now, the focus has been on getting the buildings in the right hands. And as you'll see, with 16 to 20 operators that the focus has been very deep and very sharpshooter-esque where you want to find for every single asset, the right operator. So, that's been the top priority so far. And I think the other thing I'll add is we just go through a lot of pain and effort to try and be the highest quality counterparty for someone to deal with. Whether it is the speed of execution, whether it is across the time frame of a transaction sticking with what we started off saying initially, the deal was, and in times like these, it just makes us the preferred counterparty. And so, there's a lot of recognition for that across the Street. And it's times like these that we really are able to shine. So, very excited about our pipeline for the year. Yes. I mean, that's said perfectly. And I would just add in a sense of the speed, you can only imagine we're moving and we have been moving extremely fast to address the opportunities that we see. We'll definitely build on success. It's not exactly -- what Shankh's saying, it's not about going out and trying to control everything, it's about creating success that drives value to all the various stakeholders. So, that's where our heads are at. And in the end, there'll be a little bit of the lag in the sense of where we spend money on G&A versus where we start to offset that because of reduced fees because we're just moving it like the multifamily, moving the property management services on to the book. So, a little bit of a lag there, but ultimately, it will offset and the improvement will be in margins. Yes. No, glad to. I'm not aware of any pushback. It's not to say, of course, when a rent increase goes out, there's not a discussion. But in the sense of defining pushback as a market response to that, no, I'm not aware of that. I think, the -- our partners have done a phenomenal job of communicating the increases and the reasons behind those increases. And I think our residents understand that they don't want to see important services and care cut. They want to have what they paid for, the best of that, and we're just not aware of any issues there. Yes. I mean, again, I would just say, on the value-add side, this is purely opportunistic. I mean, I just look at the world and see our portfolio is positioned so well to come with another layer of value-add opportunities because of the age of the portfolio, which are really the highest returns because the infrastructure is all in great shape. And so, you're talking about what some people would call fluff and buff, but reamenitize, enhancing the units a little bit really improving that value proposition and getting paid very well for it, very much similar to what many of the multi have done, so. But that's all enhanced the returns. Yes. So, I'll comment on what would need to happen, but not necessarily the speed at which. But if you look at it, I mean, one way to look at it is really just to simplify the world a lot and to say what would happen when a company -- from my past experience, when the two companies merge, you look and say, okay, if I step into their systems and start to fly the plane with what they have, that could happen pretty fast, right? That's not that complex. And so, the timing of it could be -- can be faster if we wanted it to be faster by stepping in that way. Obviously, what -- going back to what we're building, as I've mentioned previously, we're using largely existing modules. There's some creative stuff going on right now with the team. But generally, it's existing modules that are out there. And so, that doesn't take that long either. So, the speed can go fairly fast. The bigger issue is we're focused on success, and we're focused on working with people to deliver the success. It's not about us necessarily doing it. It's about us delivering success for all the stakeholders. So, that's where my mind is at. But the speed could go pretty fast."

            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I will review fourth quarter and the year and describe high-level business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on operational performance of our SHO and MOB portfolios. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net business, balance sheet highlights and 2023 full year guidance. Nikhil, our newly appointed CIO, is also on the call to answer questions. While we are happy to bring back full year guidance after three years, I'll point out that many macro and business uncertainties remain. I would recommend investors and analysts to focus on 2023 exit run rate to understand the earnings power of this platform and not overly emphasize the calendar year guidance. I have mixed emotions as I reflect back on 2022. As I've described to you in my prior calls, our results frankly underwound our expectation during the first half of the year. While we don't like to fix that on short-term stock performance as we believe, an appropriate window to gauge our performance is at least three to five years, you should so to measure that [ph] for generating an unsatisfactory return -- total return in 2022. But remember, a stock is a fractional ownership of a business and not a ticker. We view our fellow investors as partners for the long haul and continuously strive to improve the prospects for long-term compounding of this business. In spite of some of the headwinds that we experienced in 2022, my team and I are pleased with the underlying improvements we have seen in this platform and our talent base, resulting in a strong rebound of performance in fourth quarter and farther improving momentum being carried into 2023. Our recent progress is only the tip of the iceberg of many of our initiatives, will truly manifest themselves in the year -- next year or two, which I'll go in a minute. While overall macro headwinds persist, we have seen a considerable improvement in the key indicators of the unit economics of the business as reflected by expense per occupied room or EXPOR or revenue per occupied room, or REVPOR. On the expense front, we have seen significant progress on addressing certain challenges we have faced over first year plus, most notably on the agency and temp labor situation. In fact, export has moderated to -- in Q4 to 3.4% driven largely by a deceleration in compensation per occupied room or COMPOR to 2.6%, the lowest level we have seen in our recorded history. At the same time, REVPOR, again, the revenue per occupied room, remain a consistent bright spot for us, increasing 7.5% in Q4, a clear reflection of strong pricing power resulting from our premier locations, product and operator base. As I mentioned on our last call, one of our largest operators pulled forward January rental increases in Q4. Even without that, our Q4 REVPOR would have exceeded 6% plus, reflecting a broad-based strength across our portfolio. And while we achieved record REVPOR growth in 2022 of 5.5%, we expect to surpass this level of growth in 2023. While we achieved an impressive 19% SHOP NOI growth in 2022 and expect circa 20% NOI growth in 2023, I believe we're only at the beginning of a multiyear double-digit NOI growth, resulting from a long runway of occupancy gain, rate growth and operating margin expansion. And despite significant macro uncertainty already weighing on the fundamentals of many other sectors, our confidence in future growth of our business is supported by the need-based nature of our asset class along with a favorable demand-supply backdrop, which is getting better every single day. I'm pleased to report that 2023 is already off to a great start with January move-ins up 16% of our '19 levels, representing a meaningful acceleration from the fourth quarter. Forward-looking indicators are also showing promise in January with our total volume -- tour volume across our senior housing operating portfolio is up 25% year-over-year. I would be completely remiss to ignore perhaps one of the most important milestones in the 53-year history of our company, and that is the Private Letter Ruling we received, which permits us to both own and self manage independent living assets. The PLR provides us significant flexibility in operating our assets, and its timing coincides almost perfectly with the build-out of our industry-leading operating and asset management platform, which John and his team have been tirelessly working on. We remain optimistic that farther investment in our platform will not only result in a better margin profile of our assets, but also will meaningfully benefit the third-party operating partners across the senior living spectrum, who we choose to do business with in the future. We continue to see a tremendous opportunity to professionalize and modernize the operating side of senior living business, following our instinct where there's mystery, there's margin. And our PLR gives a significant ammunition to accelerate the pace for what Welltower 3.0 might look like. I want to thank Mike Garst, our tax team and many others whose efforts have led to this game-changing achievement. Before turning to investing environment, I want to highlight the addition of Retirement Unlimited, or RUI, to Welltower's roster of exceptional operating partner. RUI is one of the best operating performing senior housing operator in the East Coast with the highest program quality programming and care standards. RUI has consistently maintained occupancy levels at north of 90% and with hardly any use of agency lever over past few years. We announced today that RUI has assumed the management of our first community together in Alexandria, Virginia, with plans to meaningfully grow our relationship in near term through acquisitions, transition and development. We are extremely excited and humbled to partner with the Fralin and Waldron families and RUI's all star President, Doris-Ellie Sullivan, and welcome them to Welltower family. In terms of other growth partners, it was exactly a year ago when we announced our partnership with David and Simon Reuben, along with their acquisition of Avery Healthcare in the UK. As you know, Reuben Brothers is one of the most sophisticated, forward-thinking and well-capitalized global investors with the reputation of attracting best-in-class talent and technology platform. Our thesis was validated when Reuben Brothers attracted Lorna Rose, one of the most well respected operating -- senior housing operating executive in UK to join Avery as the company's CEO view in December. Lorna has spent 25 years in the industry and was most recently with Barchester, one of the UK's largest senior housing platforms. Next, on the capital allocation side, we have rarely seen a favorable environment across all our product types in all three countries we do business with in. There are 20-plus-billion of exit cue for core real estate funds and then perhaps even a longer one for non-traded REITs. This along with the challenging debt market, give us an enormous advantage to buy the right product at the right location at the right basis. Please note that while we are underrunning by more than $0.5 billion of EBITDA from pre-pandemic levels, we just reported debt metrics that are better than Q4 of 2019, along with more than $5 billion of near-term liquidity -- available liquidity. We have many avenues to access and deploy capital that I've described before, and we remain busy on all fronts. But our North Star remains consistent and simple. We strive to create per share value for our existing owners by compounding over a long period of time within our circle of competence, which we define as the area where we can assess and allocate capital with house odds rather than gambler's odds. With that, I'll pass it over to John. Thank you, Tim. While we ended 2022 on a positive note, it was also a year of sheer grit and perseverance from our team. As we face different challenges in our business, be it the expense pressure, development cost pressure or ProMedica, we remain steadfast in our belief that our job as stewards of our shareholders' capital is to solve problems when we encounter on this journey and not rip the band aid off and give away potential future upside to private equity -- to profit from either because, one, it is the easiest thing to do instead of working things out or two, the feeling on instant gratification as Wall Street tends to cheer such decisions. We see too many market participants mix up short-term volatility with long-term risk apartment capital loss. As our partners in the business, our investors can count on us to take tough road to deliver strongest returns we believe are achievable when we face challenges. This is evident in the build-out of our operating platform and our transaction with ProMedica and Integra. To paraphrase Mr. Munger, you can rest assured that we have a deferred gratification gene imprinted all over our culture, and we remind ourselves every day that big money is made not in buying and selling, but in winning. Lastly, I'm extremely delighted to see many of my partners recently appointed to the executive and senior management roles within the organization, developing the business fighting it together in the trenches, and I'm convinced that we have the deepest bench strength along with the longest runway as I look across the real estate space. Supplementing this talent is our unmatched data and machine learning capabilities, which allows us to efficiently and cost effectively evaluate new investments as well as reinvestment in our portfolio. In addition to our strength of our existing team, we continue to attract best-in-class talent from outside the industry who share our belief that the future of our business may look very different from the past. Simply said, we want to attract talent that comes from the industries with high standards. And to that point, I could not be happier that John has convinced Jerry Davis to join our team. As you all know from his many years in multifamily sector, Jerry has one of the sharpest operating minds in real estate. I have known and admired Jerry for 15 years and cannot be more excited to work with him and learn from him. I'm more convinced than ever that John along with Jerry will have an exponential impact and transform this industry. If you are or know someone of that operating caliber and more importantly have an outsider's mindset from a related or frankly unrelated industry who wants to join the formidable team of J squared, please let us know. Welltower is wide open for business, not only for asset acquisition but also for talent acquisition. With that, I'll open the call up for questions. Yes. Jonathan, you asked a very, very good question. So, as I think about -- if your question is specific to senior housing industry, I see that -- obviously, we have most of the operating partners that want to do business which we already do business with. So expansion of new operating partners is less of a focus and going deep rather than going broad is our focus. We are looking for striving for regional density with our existing partners across the different countries, right? Now, we have, I mentioned before that we have -- there are operating partners in the business, there are operators in the business that we have admired for a very long period of time. And this is a long dating process. It takes a long time for both parties to understand how we can add value to each other, right? Capital is a commodity. Just capital, us bringing capital to an operating partner, frankly speaking, in any relationship is not enough. And for our perspective, so we bring in data analytics and other operating platform initiatives that John is doing to the equation. At the same time, we want to understand whether these operating partners are thinking about the business or where the business is going 10, 20 years from now, not where the business was 10, 20 years ago, right? There's a significant mind shift that is needed in the business. And frankly speaking, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we need higher standards, higher standards of employee engagement, higher standards of customer service and higher standard of how we treat capital and what we -- and how we deliver results for the capital. And those are the type of operating partners and business partners that we're looking for, and we're grateful that we have a fundamentally a fantastic roster of these people to drive business with. Now going to the second part of your question, from an investment volume standpoint, I want to reemphasize, you're going to see a majority of the investment volume with existing partners as well as sort of the partners that we have already announced in the last couple of -- two, three years. Michael, if you think about -- different times give us opportunities for different types of product. You have seen us buy and sell every product that we own in last, call it, 7 years, 8 years under this -- under the leadership of this team, right? So, because different times, you get opportunities to buy different products at a very favorable basis. This might be the first time we're seeing across all our product type, across the three countries that we do business with, we're seeing opportunities, right? This is a very, very disruptive time from not only from debt side but also from equity side. The people who we normally compete against, right, the core funds, the non-traded REITs and others, everybody is facing very significant flow -- outflow, either because of the denominator effect that you see in pension fund world as well institutional world or some other reasons such as availability of -- not availability of debt and other situations. So, we're seeing across all product types, we're seeing very significant opportunities -- and frankly speaking, an ability to achieve IRRs that we haven't seen in some of the product types, frankly, forever. Mike, I was just not going to sit here and try to speculate what might or might not happen, but I will repeat what I've said before. If we went back to pre-COVID occupancy and pre-COVID margin, I will be really disappointed. If that's where we end, we'll be disappointed. I'll just add, Derek, one thing to that. Just as I mentioned before, we're working towards regional density and going deep and not going broad with our existing partners, right? So, think about it, I don't know, just -- you will see the future is with our select operating partners, strategic partners, we're going to have bigger density or higher density and a bigger scale in a market and with our investment in the technology platform and the operating platform with our operating partners, the ability to execute on the ground I think, again, this is going to be not only a great win for our owners, our assets, but also a great win for the select operated partners that we'll choose to do business with going forward. So, it is a very much of a focus on win-win, and that's the way business got to be. The forward thinking ones who are thinking about where the business needs to go 10 years from now, 5 years from now, 15 years from now, has come forward and want to participate in building out the platform together. The ones that are holding on to the notion of what the business was in the \u201890s are clearly realizing their future is not with us. Steve, I don't think I have much to add. Maybe Nikhil has something to add after I'm done. I would just tell you that this is sort of the only time I've seen where there's opportunity in all three product types across all three countries, right? You usually don't see that. And that's driven by -- last couple of years have been primarily debt driven, right? So, we have seen a lot of opportunities in the IRR. So, we have done senior housing 9%, call it circa, 9%, some higher, some lower, but call it around 9%. Historically, I've said medical office is an interesting business to buy or interesting space to invest around, call it, 7-plus unlevered IRR. Finally, we're seeing opportunities in 8-plus level. And on the wellness side, where the cap rates have been very, very tight, IRRs have been in the 6s, we're finally seeing they're in the high-7s, right? So, that's sort of, I would say, where the different investment landscape where we're seeing opportunities, but depends on -- some are obviously higher. We're still seeing some double-digit opportunities. But I will tell you the other thing is because it's not just debt driven but also equity driven, most of the stuff that we have bought in last couple of years, we're fundamentally focused on right location, right product, right basis. And we have bought lots of assets with no cash flow, negative cash flow. And finally, we're seeing because people have to transact, right, what's happening, we are seeing opportunities that with very good bases, with very good locations, assets are also starting to come with cash flow. That's sort of, I will say, the slight change in nuance of the investment landscape. But I don't know, Nikhil you want to add anything? Yes. So I'll take the second part. Think about we have independent living at a standalone, for example, Holiday Atria portfolio as well as our Canada portfolio. That's roughly, I would say, 2/3 to 3/4 of the independent living that we own that obviously qualifies. How this relates to, when independent living is a part of the continuum, we will figure that out. Most importantly, I want to focus on what I said before that you will see with our forward thinking select operators who have density, you will see that we will -- building out the platform, right? John has mentioned very clearly that he is building out the platform with our best operators, right? This is not a question of what part will do in-house versus in what part we'll do with operator. We have also another 15,000, 20,000 units in the wellness housing sector there, which obviously we always could have done in-house, right? So, this is finding the right balance of retail density with all the products that are out there region, and bringing in-house where we have the density versus -- or keeping it outside when our partners have density. So, the game is not to who does what. This is not a fight of just because we do something, we'll do it better. The main goal is with our operating partners build this operating platform to the highest quality technology and systems and processes and data to deliver the best outcome for our residents as well as frankly, employee experience. John, do you want to add anything to that? Yes. Thanks, Juan. So the transition piece, we'll start with that. There is not a contemplation of further transitions in our guidance. So, our first quarter has about 85% of our open and operating buildings as of 12/31. Our first quarter has 85% of that same-store and that grows to mid-90s. So on average, kind of 90% of the open and operating assets in that pool. What was the first question? Yes. So, if you think about it, we're building occupancy, right? You know that Q1 is sort of the weaker point in the occupancy spectrum, and you build occupancy -- occupancy growth happens through spring and summer. So your occupancy build on an average basis, you get closer to sort of that Q3, Q4 level where you get a better revenue, if you will, right, sort of in that annual journey. Now, think about expenses, which are also coming down, right? So you have -- you probably have a better -- significantly better exit run rate in Q4 than Q1, right? So following both revenue as well as expenses. Think about how other situation that I've described before, I think the last call, maybe the one before, is how REVPOR builds, right? You move your rents on a bunch of people at the beginning of the year and as well as our -- for our portfolio, just call it, half and half. We also have a very large operator who moved in Q4, but just think through how that plays out. And then you chase that in-place rent through your market rent, which is also going up for the year. So, if you think about from an occupancy, from rates, from expense improvements, which is we're glad that agency cost is down from, call it, 7 to sub 4. We were very unhappy. It's still sub 4. It should be significantly lower than that. So if you think through all of the main drivers, you're going to get a much higher exit run rate in Q4 than Q1. John, as I mentioned, I expect REVPOR increase to be better in '23 than '22. So, that sort of gives you -- we'll see what the market gives us. But as we sit here today, we think the pricing environment is getting better. Let me try that. So first on CapEx I do not believe, other than inflationary changes, anything change from a CapEx standpoint, right? So just understand that we bought predominantly in the last two, three years, new assets. We bought one or two portfolio as the value-add portfolio. And when we bought it, for example, the Holiday Atria portfolio, we told you exactly what we underwrote to spend on CapEx, right? We bought in an extremely cheap basis. And we told you exactly what that CapEx needs are and how we plan to invest. So from that perspective, as you think about going forward, I do not believe -- outside those couple of value-add investments that we have done, and we told you otherwise, when we have done it, we do not believe the business's CapEx needs outside the sort of inflationary increases that are happening anything has changed. Now, I think John has a very large plan, a very big plan to reamenitize the portfolio and sort of fundamentally changing what the value proposition might look like. Obviously, we'll do that if think that we're getting fantastic return on that incremental investment. But from a regular CapEx perspective, I don't think anything has changed. From a pricing power standpoint, I don't think -- what else I can add other than to what I said to John's question and the earlier question, which is we are feeling very good about the pricing power across all our countries and across all our product types. As you know that Canada has been a laggard, feels like Canada is starting to catch up. UK and U.S. has been strong and continue to be strong. So, we're feeling pretty good. John, do you want to add anything to that? Vikram, I missed one part of your question. I'll just tell you that from a pricing power standpoint, this is something I mentioned in the last call that we are -- despite our average occupancy of the portfolio, call it, circa 80%, there's a significant part of the portfolio, call it, give or take, half of the portfolio, 45% of the portfolio is in that high-80s, mid- to high-80% occupancy. There, the pricing power changes to raising price because have no rooms to sell, right? So there is a dynamic that's going on and increasingly we'll get to the point as we move average occupancy for the portfolio, more and more properties within the bucket that you will get to that pricing power because, frankly, you have no room to sell. So that transition is happening and will continue to happen in '23. Let me try to take part of that and Tim will take part of that question. So, we do not view this as a low-hanging fruit, but we do view this as a fruit that can be plucked, right? So there's a lot of effort that's going on. Tim will tell you what's modeled. Frankly, I don't know. But I will tell you that this is -- agency labor is a function of, frankly, weak management. That's just what it is, weak leadership. And we're working with our best-in-class operators to get the right people in the right place so that we should, over a period of time, see that improvement. As I've said, coming below 4% is an achievement when you start from 9%, but by no means, I want you to think that I'm actually happy with that number. That number needs to be substantially lower. And we need to really get full-time employees in the communities. This is not just a question of cost, but also, as John alluded to, it's also a question of culture and the customer experience. It will not surprise me to see that we start to self manage some assets -- some IL assets in calendar year 2023."

            "content": "Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on the fourth quarter 2022 results, the performance of our triple-net investment segment in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet liquidity update, and finally, our outlook for the year ahead. Welltower reported fourth quarter normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per diluted share, representing 7% year-over-year growth after adjusting for prior period government grants and FX headwinds. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth in the quarter of 12.9% year-over-year. Before getting into our segment results, I want to provide an update on our recently closed ProMedica restructure and the go-forward reporting treatment. In late December, we announced the closing of our restructure joint venture with ProMedica Health System and our newly formed joint venture with Integra Health. The ProMedica Health System JV consisting of 58 private pay assisted living assets will continue to be operated under a lease with ProMedica Health System and it is now part of our senior housing triple-net reporting segment. The Integra Health joint venture, consisting of 147 skilled nursing properties, comprised of a property joint venture and a master lease with Integra Health. The lease commenced upon closing in December adds to the first tranche of the property JV with Integra acquiring 15% of Welltower's stake in 54 of the assets for $73 million. As previously expected, subsequent to year-end, the second tranche of assets closed in January, Integra acquired 15% interest in another 31 assets for $74 million. The remaining 52 assets are expected to close in the second half of the year. As for the underlying operations, the subleasing of the portfolio is progressing in line with expectations. 75% of the beds have already transition management with the remainder of the portfolio waiting on state specific approvals. We will continue to update the market as the progress of management transitions in addition to underlying property level fundamentals. Now turning to the performance of the rest of our triple net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. These statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 9/30/2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 4.3% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.86 times in the quarter. Next, same-store NOI in our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 4% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.34 times in the quarter. Turning to capital market activity. In the quarter, we settled $1.5 billion of previously raised equity through our forward ATM program, helping to bring debt to EBITDA down to 6.3 times at year-end, a substantial decrease of nearly 7 times at year-end 2021 and below pre-COVID levels of Q4 2019. For the year, we settled a total of $3.7 billion of equity to fund $3.7 billion of net investment activity, allowing us to continue to deploy capital into a desiccated private market while materially delevering the balance sheet. Looking forward, we ended the year with $722 million of cash, full capacity on our $4 billion revolving line of credit and $383 million in expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan pay-downs, representing $5.1 billion in near-term available liquidity. Before moving on to our 2023 guidance, I wanted to add more context to Shankh's earlier commentary around the opportunity provided to our company by last year's Private Letter Ruling. Nearly 14 years ago, Welltower structured first day of management agreement, giving a direct economic exposure to senior housing operations. Over the last five-plus years, we built a better and stronger alignment within this contractual structure, ultimately reaching a point in 2021, where we can generate meaningful ROI through centralized human capital and technology investment at Welltower. We hired John Burkart and started to build the team around him. The PLR we received last year allowed us to meaningfully accelerate that effort as the ROI friction is entirely removed under self-management. This Welltower platform investment is evident through G&A. With greater than 80% of our expected year-over-year increase in overhead costs being driven by technology investment and new position additions in '22 and '23, focused primarily on asset management, data analytics and technology. We continue to believe that the opportunity to both modernize operations and drive efficiencies through scale in our business is vast and creates a sustainably strong cash flow tailwind when combined with the demographic-driven demand of the next decade plus. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance, which we are reintroducing for the first time since COVID uncertainty began impacting our business in March of 2020. Last night, we provided an outlook for 2023 of net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.57 to $0.75 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.35 to $3.53 per diluted share or $3.54 at the midpoint. As mentioned in the release, our 2023 guidance contemplates no adjustments for other government grants we receive in the year. So, after adjusting for $0.07 of nonrecurring government grants received in 2022, we are guiding for 5% year-over-year growth. This year-over-year increase in FFO is composed of $0.36 from growth in our senior housing operating portfolio and $0.03 from growth across the rest of our segments. These are offset by $0.04 of prior mentioned higher G&A and Welltower platform costs and $0.19 of floating rate interest and foreign exchange headwinds. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8% to 13%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%, long-term post-cute 2% to 3%, and senior housing triple-net of 1% to 3%, and finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 24%, the midpoint of which is driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.5%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 230 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth of approximately 6.25. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. I'll just add on cost. We look at this as an investment, right, on the human capital side and on the technology side. So, you know that we run our platform very efficiently, and we don't take the costs lightly as far as any further investment. But we think there's a lot of return here on investment. And so, there is a bit of a lag between dollars in and hires, in that return. But on a go-forward basis, I expect us to be very prudent about it and continue to show high return for dollars spent. Yes. Those are covered one-times on EBITDA basis. From a modeling perspective, we're essentially in the high-3s as a percentage of compensation. So pretty flat from where we came out of 2022."

        "content": "Operator: Hello. My name is Lisa, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatt McQueen: Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to describe our capital allocation priorities, ProMedica Senior Care transaction and the rapidly evolving capital markets environment. I will also review some high-level business trends before handling the call over to John, who will provide details on operational trends and a brief update on our operating platform. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since we last spoke 90 days ago, despite a flattish earnings trends on a sequential basis, driven by several existing headwinds, including FX, interest rate and utility expenses, our underlying business is actually improving meaningfully and setting up for the coil spring recovery that we hoped for. In our senior housing operating business, same-store revenue is up 10.8% year-over-year, driven by strong occupancy gains, and most importantly, pricing power. 5.3% same-store rate growth is the best we have seen in our recorded history and I want to remind everyone that we're compounding already industry-leading rate growth from last year. From these early trends, I believe you will see a further improvement in Q4, which will create a strong setup for 2023. However perhaps what I'm most excited about is the progress we're making on the labor front with compensation for occupied unit is up 4.3% year-over-year, the lowest level of growth we have reported since the beginning of pandemic. Our operating partners are experiencing a significant surge in applications, which has translated into strong increase in net hiring. In fact, in September, total portfolio monthly contract labor spend was the lowest since August of 2021 and subsequently improved in October. We believe this trend will continue into year-end outside the normal pickup agency use during the holiday season and into well into the next year. We strongly believe the labor market is changing for the better, and it will help our sector to be a total standout amongst all real estate sectors next year on a relative basis. SHO portfolio same-store NOI growth was 17.6% in the quarter, led by U.S., which posted third quarter of 20-plus percent growth and assisted living product reported same-store NOI growth of an impressive 25.1%. Let me highlight three operating partners for you, that provide further insight into why I'm so pleased with our progress over the last 90 days. Number one, Oakmont. As you recall, we transitioned 10 top California assets to Oakmont in August while we expected some initial disruption to occupancy NOI during that transition. In actuality, we recognized an immediate benefits due to remarkable performance from Courtney's team. These assets have experienced a slight increase of NOI and occupancy despite challenges that are normally incurred during a transition. This is the first time I've seen a transition with no negative P&L impact, apart from the six assets we transition to Oakmont last year. I expect these properties as well as the other assets that we transition to Oakmont to add significantly to our 2023 growth. If you're visiting San Francisco this month for NAREIT Conference, I recommend you to join our property tour and experience firsthand the remarkable job this team has done. To my earlier point on shift of labor market during the summer, open positions across Oakmont platform was 16% of total jobs. It is down to low single-digit at this point. Number two, StoryPoint. StoryPoint is one of our best operating partners perhaps will be the source of biggest NOI swing next year, with a billion dollars of investment with low occupancy properties, which is generating approximately 2.7% yield in Q3. StoryPoint made remarkable improvement a top line on both occupancy and rates, but the properties have not generated a significant NOI in 2022, as these properties were just over the breakeven occupancy and agency cost was very detrimental. Their open positions are now down more than 50% through the end of October and we expect 80% reduction of agency by the end of this month. We believe that stabilized NOI for this group of portfolio is about circa $80 million, which will be substantially achieved in 2024. While will not close this gap in 2023, I expect will make significant strides next year, and really over the half year way mark. We cannot be more pleased with execution Dan and the team has pulled off. Number three Sunrise. Sunrise is our largest operator due to a national presence Sunrise experienced significant labor challenges and has had to rely on contract labor for last many quarters. Jack and his team has made remarkable progress in this area over the last 60 days. Contract labor down 52% from year-to-date run rate and I believe sunrise will be the biggest contributor to contract labor improvement in the coming months and quarters. Given strong rates Sunrise benefit from in this incredibly well located Welltower building, we should see extremely strong NOI growth contribution from Sunrise. While we're encouraged - very encouraged by these trends, and our fourth quarter guidance of 21% growth at the midpoint, I'll remind you that we are at the very early inning of senior housing recovery. We\u2019ll remain as excited as ever about the growth prospects in coming years and the 80-plus population growth will continue to accelerate and as new construction in the sector will come to come to near a standstill. In fact, 2023 should see 4.5% increase in 80-plus population. As you may have observed only 2,700 units got started in Q3. And frankly, I don't even understand how these people will make any money in development. While new development should continue to come down, assuming people want to develop to make any money. Another interesting phenomenon we're observing is that the thousands of units have been taken offline either because of obsolescence or because of higher and better use like behavioral health. As of 9/30, almost 15,000 units were taken offline on a TTM basis. I also want to highlight consistent and steady performance of our outpatient medical group under Ryan's leadership. Our retention rate for the quarter is a remarkable 92.7% and rent spreads are ticking up into the mid-3. Both new and renewal leases -- for both new and renewal leases, I'm pleased that our weighted average escalators are now about 3%. I'm also pleased that the low interest rate environment and the wall of capital that drove 2% to low 2% escalator seems to be a thing of the past. Kelsey-Seybold, which is our largest MOB tenant, and also represents a very significant portion of the Helmand pipeline was acquired by United Health during this summer. The significant credit upgrade of our largest tenant and our development client represents a meaningful value creation for our shareholders. The most significant change we observed in this, however, in the MOB space, is the remarkable widening of cap rates. I've stayed like a broken record for a long time that MOB cap rate made no sense to us, given where the forward view of inflation was relative to underlying growth rate on the cash flow. I'm pleased to see other capital sources are now waking up to the ugly realities of real return on capital in this inflationary environment. There was nothing wrong with this asset class except price. And I relieved to see that has finally changed billions of dollars of transactions were consummated at low cap rate, often which short-term floating rate debt, the party's over with - is over with capital structure and cash flow, as many of these vehicles are now upside down. We'll be observing the space closely in coming months and quarter. Now, I would like to discuss our recent restructuring of a lease with ProMedica health system. I'm not going to bore you with the details our fundamental thesis of this investment in 2018. I laid it out, clearly when we did this transaction, we didn't predict COVID and the impact and its impact on the cash flow portfolio, and frankly, were underwhelmed by the execution. But the fundamental investment thesis of the original transaction should still protect our shareholder\u2019s capital, that basis, and appropriate structure are critical to any real estate investment. While we have historically relied on our operatively to drive cash flow and that yield, we never make real estate investment decision based on yield. We believe success in real estate investment over a long period of time, is a function of right basis and staying power. If you own an apartment in New York City for $400,000, while everybody owns equivalent apartment for $1 million, you can still charge rent for that unit and generate strong returns. That is such a simple yet perhaps one of the most overlooked concept on Wall Street. The cacophony of noise around ProMedica as negative dark coverage over the last few months have reached a fever pitch. And we honestly understand and empathize with this Pavlovian response as the history of healthcare REIT sector is full of remedies, such as massive red cards, or disposal of assets at fire sale prices that result in significant value destruction to shareholders. Even though I'm personally humbled by the cash flow deterioration in the ProMedica portfolio, let me repeat that we are not experiencing a rent cut on a cash basis, and our investors are the beneficiary of a satisfactory total return to date. And that goes back to an incredibly favorable basis and structure. To continue my metaphor previous metaphor, Manhattan apartment rents might come down from 5000 to 4000 in a bad year, but we never hypothetical even charged 4000 as we bought our unit at such a low price. That is why our rent is now going up not down after this transaction. And I continue to believe it remains below market and will be a source of future value creation. As I mentioned in our last call, ProMedica has made significant strides in reducing its operating losses, which are farther narrow the last 90 days to both occupancy gains and lower labor cost contract labor costs particularly. Integral or its parent entity which we have done multiple transactions previously, has successfully executed many turnarounds, including those involving at our assets and we sold it to them in last couple of years and is well positioned to return these assets to its previous glory using a regional operating strategy, just like they have done over the last couple of years. We are looking through integrates parent entity and the owner for the downside protection through subordination of their equity as well as significant other guarantees and will subsequently share significant value creation with us. But I cannot overemphasize that the fundamental idea of below market rent basis equals to below market rent is not about ProMedica, it is about our belief how we invest and protect our shareholder\u2019s capital. If a business has demand growth, and you can own it for significantly less than what it costs to build, the low leverage capital structure, it is challenging for me to see how lose money in most scenarios. We remain partner with ProMedica, albeit on its surface on a much smaller scale and we'll be delighted to see the significant credit improvement of this important institution in Toledo. Finally, let's discuss the current capital markets environment, which excites me to no end. Before I go into what we might do in the future, let's discuss what we have done in the past under this leadership team. If we go back and read all our comments about capital deployment in the last few years, you will notice a few attributes, one, was unlevered IRR buyers and we underwrite significant cap rate expansion at exit. Hence, the recent rate increase doesn\u2019t fluster us, just as we have never chased low rates down under the guise of low cost per capital. Two, our unrelenting focus on basis relative replacement cost, and as a result, we seriously dislike low cap rates in stabilized occupancy scenarios. Nothing has happened so far, even in this turbulent capital markets backdrop that require us to change how we invest capital. We are experiencing historic volatility in the treasury market, in every part of the -- with every part of the yield curve inverted right now, with significantly the most important two to 10 curve is as inverted as it was during Paul Volcker's time 40 years ago. One approach for us would be to ride out the storm in a shelter and do nothing. But those of you know as well, know, we're unlikely to do so. We maintain a fairly favorable capital position and a war chest due to our extremely talented capital markets team under the leadership of Tim. Despite our unfavorable public cost of capital on a spot basis, today, we have no dearth of global institutions who want to partner with us. And let me remind you, again, a simple capital allocation framework I've described to you before. Every company effectively has four choices of raising capital, one, tapping internal cash flow, two, issuing debt, three, issuing equity and four, disposition of existing assets. It also has five essential choices of deploying that capital. One, investing in existing assets, two, acquisitions, three, buying debt at a discount, four, paying a dividend and five, buying stock at a discount. You can loosely call the first set of choices as selling, but the right description would be sourcing or raising capital, you can loosely call the second set of choices as buying, but perhaps the correct description will be deployment of capital. Following the same line of thinking loosely speaking, consistently, buying low and selling high creates value for shareholders. In a more wholesome and thoughtful description, optimizing these choices from this menu of sources and uses in a tax efficient manner, creates meaningful value for continuing shareholders on a partial basis. Our goal is to maximize partial value and partial cash flow, not to become the biggest or the most revolutionary. Our capital allocation team on both sides of the balance sheet is poised to pounce on these great manual opportunities, while the most volatile and interest rate environment in four decades has put in front of us. And at the same time, John's team is just getting started on the journey of cash flow and platform optimization. With that. I'll pass it over to John. John?\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh. I'll provide some insight into our operating business, starting with the medical office portfolio. In the third quarter same-store NOI growth for our outpatient medical business was 1.4% over the prior year's quarter which was below trends, due to some timing issues on tenant improvements, delaying moving and higher utility expenses. We continue to see strong retention levels at 93% in the quarter and accelerating renewal rates in the marketplace. Turning to our senior housing operating portfolio, the recovery in the sector continues. As Shankh mentioned, revenue in our same-store portfolio came in at 10.8% in the third quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. All three regions showed strong revenue growth starting with Canada 4.4%, the U.S. and UK growing in an impressive 11.6% and 18.9% respectively. Revenue growth for the quarter was driven by a 390 basis point increase in occupancy, and another quarter of healthy pricing power with REVPOR growth of 5.3%. As Shankh mentioned the highest we've witnessed. Sequentially, the portfolio occupancy continued to improve with a gain of 110 basis points during the quarter. While expenses remain a challenge, our operators continue to control expense for or expense per occupied room. The cost for compensation per occupied room only grew at 4.3% in the third quarter over the prior year's quarter. The lowest growth rate since 2019. Expense for grew at a rate of 3.7% in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, well below our REVPOR growth and 5.3%, driving expansion of 130 basis points on a year-over-year basis in our margins. As our operators have pivoted from the COVID state to normalized operations and as labor and materials have become more available, we have aggressively addressed maintenance that was delayed during COVID. Which resulted in slightly elevated repairs and maintenance during the maintenance expense during the quarter. Overall, the quarter's occupancy gains strong REVPOR an expense controls enable the senior housing operating portfolio to deliver 17.6% year-over-year same-store NOI growth in the period led by the U.S. with over 20% year-over-year growth. While Canada NOI grew at 6.3% and UK was up 9.8%. Going forward, we expect the operating portfolio to continue to deliver outside NOI growth with each geography expected to experience accelerating NOI growth in the fourth quarter. As we look forward to what many believes will be a weaker labor market in 2023, it's important to realize that labor as an expense represents about 60% of our total expenses. Additionally, nurses are only about 5% of the labor force at the communities. And although there are other more specialized positions at the communities, most of the physicians require skills that are transferable from other sectors of the economy, allowing us to benefit from the softer labor market, as Shankh noted. Regarding our operating platform, we continue to quickly move forward on plans to pilot our first module in early 2023 with several other modules in the works. Like all technology rollouts, it's about people, processes, data, and then technology. So it's not about flipping a switch, it takes teamwork. The results will show up over time. Our meetings with our operators have been very productive as we bring together their skills and experience with our own to build a better future for the industry. Finally, I would like to thank our operators and their employees for making these results possible. It's been a full sprint since the beginning of COVID. And they have addressed one challenge after the next. We are finally at a point where it seems like there's light at the end of the tunnel. Occupancy continues to rise, net hiring is occurring month after month. REVPOR continues to outpace expense for which will drive further margin expansion, and so much more. We wish to thank everyone and wish them a wonderful Thanksgiving. And thank you for your hard work. I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\nTim McHugh: Thanks, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2022 results. Performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet liquidity update, and finally our outlook for the fourth quarter. Welltower reported third quarter normalized funds from operations of $0.84 per diluted share, representing 6.2% growth over the prior year period when adjusted for HHS funds received and changes in FX rates. Marking our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth since the start of the pandemic. We also reported our second consecutive quarter positive total portfolio same-store NOI growth, the 7.2% year-over-year growth. Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6, 30 2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 1.6% year-over-year, below the low end of our guidance range, which is primarily timing related. Trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is 0.83 times in the quarter. Next, same-store NOI and our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3.1% year-over-year, in trailing 12 month EBITDA coverage of 1.31 times. And lastly health systems, which comprise of our joint venture with ProMedica Health System. Had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month EBITDA and EBITDAR coverages were negative 0.01 and negative 0.6 respectively, as operations continue to be impacted by higher agency utilization costs in the second quarter relative to the prior year. What are these coverage figures in context of our announcement last night, trailing 12-month ProMedica senior care EBITDAN coverage of negative 0.01 implies trailing 12 month EBITDAN of negative $1.6 million relative to $106.68 million of cash rent paid in the trailing 12-month period ending 6, 30 2022? The transition of the skilled nursing business will bring the remaining ProMedica senior care EBITDAN back to profitability with the trailing 12-month coverage of nearly two times relative to the remaining rent and the 58 assisted living facilities they will continue to operate. Thus, the transition to Integra Health has a dual benefit providing us a well-capitalized strategic partner to focus on the skilled nursing properties while also leaving ProMedica senior care a substantially better financial state following the transaction. Turning to the capital market activity. In the quarter we continue to enhance our balance sheet strength by utilizing our ATM program to raise approximately $760 million afford equity an average price of $80.12. We settled 9.1 million shares for total proceeds of at $842 million to fund $1 billion of net investment activity, leaving $1.5 billion of unsettled forward ATM as of 9, 30. Post quarter end, we settled additional ATM proceeds to fund investment activity and pay down $850 million of total debt. $817 million of which was floating rate. Post that pay down, we have the full $4.0 billion available borrowing capacity on our line of credit, and no one secured maturities until 2024. We expect to finish the fourth quarter with consolidated net-debt-to EBITDA below 6.5 times for the first time since 2020. From liquidity perspective, in addition to $4 billion, we pass in line of credit we have $1 billion of cash and forward equity and $580 million remaining near term dispositions and loan pay down proceeds and a 4.6 yield representing $5.6 billion of total near term liquidity. Lastly, moving to our fourth quarter outlook. Last night, we provide an outlook for the fourth quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders, of $0.08 to $0.13 per diluted share, and normalized FFO of $0.80 to $0.85 per diluted share, or $82.5 at the midpoint. As mentioned in the release, our fourth quarter guidance contemplates no HHS funds to be received in the fourth quarter. So after adjusting for $1.5 of non-recurring items, including HHS funds receiving the third quarter were effectively flat for sequential FFO. The sequential change is composed of $0.02 from sequential increases in senior housing operating portfolio and $0.01 from sequential increases in outpatient medical and senior housing triple net. These are offset by $0.03 of interest expense and foreign exchange headwinds. Underlying this FFO guidance, is estimated total portfolio of year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8.5% to 10.5%. Driven by sub segment growth of outpatient medical, 1.5% to 2.5%. Long-term post Q 2.5% to 3.5%. Senior housing tripled net, 5% to 6%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 18.5% to 23.5%. Driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.5% year-over-year. Underlying this revenue growth, is expectation approximately 200 basis points of year-over-year occupancy increase and rent growth approximately 7%. And with that, I'll hand the back the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thanks, Tim. One of my mentors, Peter Kaufman often says, life is not about predicting, it's about positioning. Did we predict that ProMedica EBITDA coverage will turn negative? Absolutely not. But we positioned for it and structured as such. Did we know COVID will happen and availability of credit in senior housing sector will weaken? No, but we positioned for it. We own more than 11,000 units of age restricted and age targeted apartments that will benefit from government agency backstop financing at very attractive pricing from which we can generate a couple of billions of dollars of proceeds. Did we predict that our stock will be in the low 60s and we'll lose our access to equity capital? No, we didn't. But we positioned for it and raised $3.28 billion of capital at an average price of $86.55 this year. We have no idea if rates are going back down or going back up and how ugly the capital markets environment might turn before it gets better. We're laser focused on what we can control and have an incredible organization that is rallying to take advantage of the opportunities with how thoughts as opposed to gambler thoughts. I cannot be more excited about the period of unprecedented far share value creation that we are embarking on for our existing owners. And with that, I'll open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: Morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just a quick 2-parter here. One, you talked a lot about pricing power. You gave the examples across operators on how pricing in labor is improving. Just how sustainable is this across your regions maybe within the U.S., but also globally? And then can you just add on to that, any early signs that the elevated flu is impacting fundamentals?\nShankh Mitra: I'll take the pricing power, John, if you take the flu, that's great. So from a pricing part standpoint, Vikram, if you just look at what we said at the beginning of the year, nothing really changed, except if you think about what happens is in the industry, not at least for our portfolio, you've got a lot of renewals in the beginning of the year. And this year, we got very strong pricing, obviously. And given that the gap between where market rent is as well as where your renewal rates are obviously with the rents that are rolling off, there's a gap over a period of the year that sort of comes down, right, that's sort of what happens in the normal year. What we have said this year, given that market rents have been rising at a faster rate than annual rates, first time, honestly, like a decade. So we have seen that gap close down pretty meaningfully, and you're seeing RevPOR increases are actually getting better through the year. You adds on top of that, that we are seeing some early renewals for next year in that sort of, call it, another 10-ish percent range, and we expect that obviously, we'll do similar type of pricing increases as we come to next year, you will see that pricing power will continue to hold up and RevPOR rate increases will continue to hold up. So we're pretty excited about it. But remember, pricing power also comes in many forms and substances, right? So you have occupancy of the portfolio and many parts of the portfolio is getting to a point overall portfolio might still be at 80% occupancy, but there is segments of the portfolio is well above high 80s and 90% occupancy, where it starts to get pretty meaningful pricing power because you have no innings to sell anymore, right? So as we get into that environment more and more, I believe that you will see sustainable pricing power. I have no crystal ball on exactly what the macroeconomic environment would be next year. But as we sit here today, we feel very good about pricing.\nJohn Burkart: Yes. On your question regarding the flu, I most certainly can't predict the future. But what I can say is that the COVID protocols, I think, will mitigate the situation within our community, they're still in place. I was at one of the properties very recently, and I'm waiting in line to get in, we wash hands, temperature check, wear a mask, et cetera. And I'm going to align with employees any vendor, all of us. That's the protocol. It's a safe, thoughtful protocol. And so my expectation is that, that will have a very positive impact in the communities, how the flu season goes in the U.S. and otherwise, I don't -- I can't predict that. But I do think the COVID protocols will be very positive going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Good morning. Can we discuss the newly authorized $3 billion in share repurchase program? How do you feel about the shares at current levels? And I guess, the possible timing of execution given the announcement comes in conjunction with earnings, which is seems unique? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Good morning, Derek. I think I laid out pretty clearly what our possible capital deployment opportunities look like, buying back shares is one of them. And frankly speaking, as you know how we think, we are unlevered IRR buyers. And we look at everything from that lens or you can look at from the basis lens, and you will see that we find our stock to be very, very attractively priced, and we'll measure that against every other opportunities we have.  I cannot predict on timing. That's just not -- we just don't do that, as you know. But we know -- you know how we think. We think through a lens basis to replacement cost, and we think through an eye of total unlevered IRR. And if you do those calculations, you will come to the perhaps the same conclusion that we have come through.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for the time. John Burkart, as operations recover in the SHO portfolio, in between AL versus IL, do you expect structurally different margins between the two businesses once fundamentals fully stabilized?\nJohn Burkart: There naturally are different margins starting out. But I think that the endpoint will change. I think what we're doing with the operating platform will change that across the board and because AL has perhaps might say more opportunity, though the impact might be slightly greater there. But I think the whole business is going in the right direction at this point in time. And I think we're benefiting across the board.\nShankh Mitra: John, you didn't ask for my opinion, my $0.02 on this topic is that you will see more improvement in AL than IL, but you'll see improvement in both. But you asked the right person, that question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Ma with Evercore.\nWendy Ma: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So could you please give us some color about the moving trends of different senior housing project types like IL, AL and the senior apartments? And also given the current slowdown of the housing transaction market, have you observed any slowdown of your independent living move-in?\nShankh Mitra: I'm not sure I completely followed that question, but do you think -- I think you asked about the moving trends in the senior\u2019s apartment business, if I heard that correctly, I will tell you that \u2013 go ahead, Wendy.\nWendy Ma: And also -- sorry, can you give some color for different senior housing types like IL, AL and also the senior apartments?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. Okay. So I think I understand the question. So look, I mean, if you think about from a product-type perspective, as I mentioned, that the assisted living is going through probably the most robust recovery perhaps for nothing other than the fact that it is the most need-based environment. It's more susceptible, least susceptible to in the macroeconomic environment. When you need it, you need the product when you need it. And obviously, it also fail farther. So we have more rooms to climb back up. So that's why we're seeing the most sort of robust recovery. As I mentioned, the NOI growth in that sector for the quarter was 25-plus percent, right? So that's sort of -- let's just then talk about the senior\u2019s apartment business. That business has been as good of a business as any business I've seen has been very strong. Through COVID, it's been very, very strong. Through times, I mean our portfolio is at 95-plus percent occupancy. As you know, we operate in the mid-market portion of that business, which is very dependent on social security and everything else. And you've got a massive cola increase next year, which we also think will be very beneficial for the pricing power increase in that business next year. Independent living, obviously, independent living did not fall as far as assisted living, and it's coming back more slowly. But that is a -- I personally think that's a good business when you combine that with other property types. And I think, obviously, Canada, which is our majority of our independent living exposure, has been so hard to recover, but as John noted, that we are starting to see improvement there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Bernstein with Capital One.\nDaniel Bernstein: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to kind of expand on your comments about the upside down, I guess, private buyers in the MOB space. Just trying to understand there a little bit more if lenders are actually foreclosing on assets? And maybe if you are already seeing some opportunities there to buy assets at a better IRR? And maybe on a related question, does that just do your comments also apply to seniors housing and skilled nursing where I believe there are some upside down loans as well?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So Dan, we haven't seen lenders are foreclosing on medical office loans yet. But my comment was if you -- it's just called the convexity of the situation, right, when you have very, very low rates, and people buying cap rates that are in that environment makes sense and then treasury card moves 200, 300 basis points. The treasury cards sitting on top of or above the cap rates that you are paid that's a prior upside down convexity situation, and that's the comment I was making, it takes time for lenders to foreclose, it takes time.  But we are starting to see some meaningful increase in the cap rates there, which is interesting. We're not yet to talk about whether we are going to look at that and execute on that yet. We have lots of opportunities that we see on a relative basis. We talked about, obviously, senior housing is one of those. Nothing changed. I'm specifically pointed out in MOBs because that has changed. Senior housing as an opportunity was there for last 18 months and when executing on it, nothing changed there, right, and continues to be super attractive. On top of that, to the earlier question Derek asked, our stock isn't really attractive.  So we look at every opportunity and think about what's the unlevered IRR on a risk-adjusted basis and what's the sort of execution risk as well as obviously the frictional cost that comes with the execution risk. But is the way finally first time in years has become interesting. And yes, but it's interesting at a price. And that price is likely a lot lower than most what you think.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just 1 2-parter. Just looking back at the slide in the deck, on the long-term $543 million embedded NOI. My question is just on that $230 million that comes from getting back to 4Q '19 NOI levels. Your comments sounds like you're pretty constructive on sort of margin improvement still with sort of the acceleration you saw in revenues relative to expenses this quarter.  Can you just remind us how you're thinking about the margins of that $230 million versus sort of the 4Q '19 level is part one? And if I could take in a part two, which is just on the ProMedica consideration, about $0.5 billion, how much of that is the 15% stake that they're giving up? And how much of that is sort of the working capital.\nTim McHugh: Yes, I'll start with the first comment on the margin side. The assumption is we get back to pre-COVID levels. So no assumption on change in margins. We assume we get back to pre COVID level profitability and operating margins of about 30.8% across the portfolio.\nShankh Mitra: On the consideration, it's roughly half and half.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: Yes, I just wanted to touch on the new SNF JV. I know you just kind of highlighted the rough size of the operating reserves ProMedica is going to be providing. But how is that going to be distributed to the new operators? Are they simply earmarked to fund near-term cash flow losses during the transitions? And what happens if these new operators don't actually need to access those reserves?\nShankh Mitra: The reserves are earmarked for the operating losses, working capital losses and that reserve will go to them to improve the quality of the portfolio. So if they do a good job and don't need all -- that's good for them. So they share the risk and they get the benefit of their savings there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.\nTayo Okusanya: Yes, good morning. Again, congrats on the quarter and the transition. I have been covering this from15 years. I don't think I've ever seen a rent restructuring where the rents went up. So that's pretty cool to see. In regards to Integra, and again, this idea that they're going to be subleasing a lot of the assets to regional operators. Just curious a little bit again. Your mantra in the past is always going to be as close to the operator as you possibly can. You add even on the Board at ProMedica. How is that relationship going to be with these subcontracted operators? And how do you kind of manage that to ensure you continue to kind of get operational excellence out of them?\nShankh Mitra: Tayo, extraordinarily good question, and thank you for your comment there. I'll just add one thing to that not only the rent is going up also the previous tenant being close to $0.5 million on the table. To make sure that these properties are taking care of going forward. So we think our partner for that. So I'll just add to the question of why we didn't go and find the offers. Our mantra is to get close to the operators, but that's in the senior housing business. I fundamentally believe in the expertise, and we have worked with Integra and its parent company on many of these transactions before. There's no caution that they are significantly better in the skilled nursing business than we are aware and will ever be. So we are sharing and for creating that value, I've mentioned in my script that we're seeing very significant upside that they can create with them. And return, they're providing us the downside protection, which is very important for us. So you think about it, you got to do in life, what you are best at. Think about from an op standpoint, we think we understand operations of senior living, the wellness housing business as well as MOB business. And we want to partner with people who we fundamentally believe on the other hand, are very good in other businesses, and that's what you're saying. Fundamentally, it is sort of going through the decision-making is going to the people who are the best at what they are good at. At the same time, it sort of cut the risk reward in terms of who creates value. It's just as simple as that. As I've said before, you can see the value still remains at very attractive basis, what you can get to.  You know the total rent, you know what market sort of rent sort of constant of significant business is, and you can divide it to a value and you will see that value is still extraordinarily attractive and thus, the rent is extraordinarily attractive and remains below market. So there will be hopefully a lot of upside as the regional operators bring this portfolio back to his previous Glory, which we actually -- this is not a guess. We have -- we kill how many assets we have transacted, Medicare assets we\u2019re transacted with Integra and its parent. About 21, 21 assets. We have seen them doing it. And we are going on an execution path that we have seen in the last couple of years. So fully, there's a lot of value to be created for residents, for employees, for capital, and that will be shared between the two parties. But it is fundamentally the belief of they're giving us the downside protection for which they should enjoy very significant upside that they create -- on the other hand, for us, it's all about where we sit in the risk spectrum.  So it's a win-win-win for all three parties. ProMedica wants to focus on its core business, and wants to be in the higher margin business and that's the leadership that they are taking that forward. There's a very significant improvement in their credit. For Welltower, it's obviously a great day for some value realization as well as, obviously, taking this portfolio to the hands where we can create another round of very significant up step of values. For Integra, they can ping it at a very attractive basis. And obviously, they're creating the value that they will share the upside with us. So it's a win-win-win on all fronts.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: Hi. We appreciate the expanded development disclosure. But what's the time frame that you see for ramping the developments from the 1.6% initial yield to the 7% stabilized yield?\nTim McHugh: Yes, Michael, I appreciate recognition that we're trying to help just the ramp or the kind of trajectory of how that cash flow comes through and it depends on the type of development. So we think about our -- where a lot of our starts have been as of late is more in the senior apartments to on the housing side. And there, you're talking about more 12, 18 months type ramp towards stabilization in the traditional senior housing side, it's more of a 24, 36-month ramp. And that's where more of the lower yields negative by able to come in the first 12 months.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotia Bank.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just want to go back to ProMedica. Clearly, strong pricing you got there and the cash rent going up as attractive. I just want to see, though, if you could let us know the GAAP impact because I didn't see any mention of lease escalators for the new arrangement you had previously. So just trying to understand the FFO impact from this. And separately, if you had -- I don't know if you're going to be filing details on the new lease, but if you had anything you can share right now in terms of escalators, financial covenants CapEx requirements because those were specific, very sort of onerous conditions of the last lease with ProMedica, which kind of strengthened I think, the whole process you went through. So any detail there would be helpful? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Very good question. The escalators remain the same, 2.75%. And the GAAP impact, as we mentioned, will be roughly neutral to slightly accretive. One of the leases are remaining the same lease ManorCare, the Aramco senior living lease is going to 10 years. So you have a negative GAAP impact there. So net-net, you will be roughly neutral to slightly attractive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning. Curious, first off, if there were other partners you approach for the ProMedica joint venture. How do we think about you going from a health system investment with feeders into these assets to the more regional operator approach? And then just lastly, I'm curious, kind of going back to 2016, 2017, wasn't the plan to ultimately exit the SNF business. And so curious how you think about the strategic direction of that segment of the portfolio?\nShankh Mitra: So can you please repeat the first part of your question again?\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes. I was just curious if you approached any other partners beyond just Integra for the new joint venture.\nShankh Mitra: So look, it is no secret that we have been thinking about in the industry that we have been thinking about this particular portfolio for a long time. We have been approached by at least five parties who are interested in being this transaction similar or higher value similar or higher structures. We went with a partner that we know very well, where we felt the execution risk is much lower. But I think if you have heard that you have correctly heard that we have been approached by many groups because these assets are not only very attractive assets, they have very good history, but also the basis remains very, very attractive. Going back to 2016, '17, I think your question was to exit the SNF business. I -- we are very clearly laid out two years ago when I took over as CEO we have a very simple strategy that we want to make money on a risk-adjusted basis on a partial basis for our existing shareholders. That's the strategy, and it's a very simple strategy whether it's skilled nursing, whether it's medical office or the senior apartments, whether it's senior housing, what is debt to equity, value-add development, opportunistic will go anywhere we can find opportunities to make money on a partial basis for existing shareholders. That's a simple strategy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Shankh, I was just hoping you could talk to maybe opportunities you see outside of the U.S. given the unusually strong U.S. dollar and whether that presents a wider opportunity set for potential acquisitions?\nShankh Mitra: One extraordinarily good question. As you know, we get really excited about basis and were USD, we raised capital in USD, our expenses are mostly in USD, capital structures and USD. And we think about basis in terms of USD. And as you can figure out, U.K. on a U.S. dollar basis has never looked more attractive and Canada also looks pretty attractive. But U.K. particularly given what happens to the currency situation, it's extraordinarily attractive. If you add on top of that, that you don't have a super functioning debt market in U.K., like you have the agency support in U.S. and Canada. It's a very, very interesting market. I have never seen U.K. opportunities as cheap as it looks today from the U.S. dollar investor. And that probably perhaps goes for any asset class, anything even for shoppers. So you're picking up the right thing, we're absolutely thinking about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRichard Anderson: Thanks, good morning. Congrats on the ProMedica Integra transaction. The market seems to be rewarding you for that resolution. But the way I look at it is your kind of married ProMedica in 2018, but you signed a prenup, and that protected your downside. And all this is based on basis and it's all clear and understood. But now you're selling 15% to Integra, what happens to base for that 15%?  In other words, 85% I assume, stays put -- but are you selling -- are you upping your basis and eliminating some of that \u201cprenup\u201d component so that if there is a disruption going forward with Integra and its regional partners, that you still have an equal amount of protection should something go wrong here? Because a transition isn't a silver bullet. It usually -- it sometimes works, but sometimes not. So I just want to get a gauge in the future in terms of how you're protected going forward? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So our basis remains the same, and you can do the calculation on -- again, you have the total rent. You know what the give or take yield is in the business. And you can get to the total value, rent divided by the yield give will get you the value. You can divide that by the total number of beds, and you will see Integra basis are also very attractive. So our basis remains attractive. Remember, what we sold to Integra is what we got for ProMedica for nothing. So it's important for you to understand the nuances of what's happening here. So our basis remains very attractive. Obviously, we got the support for the operator who is living and living, as I mentioned, living close to $0.5 billion on the table. We created another structure where that 15%, which Integra is paying for remains subordinated that further lowers our net basis, which is the first time when you remember, I talked about that, that condition remains, we have obviously other guarantees in place, as I said. And if that's not the case, remains -- remember, in the last question, I said that people want these assets because they're very well-located assets, and a very good location and the very attractive basis. So we don't see, as I said, look, anything can happen, Rich. But as I've mentioned before, four years ago on this topic, that low basis, well-located assets that have demand that's held in low-level structure, it's hard to see how we lose money. Anything can happen, anything is possible. But if you think about we have to leave within the realms of probabilities, not possibilities, it looks pretty good to me.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Michael. You've talked a lot about the opportunity for improvements in modernization in senior housing. But when you look at the skilled side, and I recognize it's a very different business, more regulatory considerations and everything like that. But are there opportunities to improve either the operations or share best practices from a well perspective that maybe could help coverage going forward?\nShankh Mitra: Nick, first, congratulations for getting the top job. We have been a big fan of yours for a long time, and obviously, thank you for your question on the call today. So look, I've mentioned very, very clearly that we do not consider ourselves a skilled nursing expert. If we did, then we would not bring in our partners in this deal, who we consider knows the business better than we do. So I will leave that to our partner to execute the strategy, which we have mentioned, as Nikhil just mentioned, that we have done just from these portfolio 21 assets before, we'll leave it to them to maximize where, in this case, is this sort of a structural protection is what we are after, not maximizing value through operators. That's what they're bringing to the people in this case, and we remain focused on our core businesses, where -- whether it's senior living, whether it's well in housing or medical office, and that's what John is spending all this time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning. Just sticking with ProMedica for a minute here. I guess 1 of the expected operational synergies from ProMedica acquiring the ManorCare SNF assets in the first place was likely centered around good flow of patient referrals from ProMedica hospitals into a lease of the ManorCare SNFs where it made sense geographically. I guess I'm curious, with hindsight, it that part of the strategy plays out the way everyone thought it would maybe just perhaps the underwhelming execution that you alluded to, Shankh, was just more a function of just tough industry dynamics for SNFs overall?  And also under the new agreement then, does ProMedica patient referrals to the SNFs under Integra's operating control stay intact going forward as part of the strategy for Integra to turn things around is really to maybe widen and expand the Medicare post-acute referral sources to improve the occupancy?\nShankh Mitra: Let me try to address your question, Steve, and then Nikhil, you jump in. First is the fundamentally the strategic part of the patient flow point that you made has not played out. And has it not played out because we walk directly into a very tough environment of COVID or has it not played out because the idea we couldn't execute or ProMedica could not execute. I don't know the answer to that question. Hindsight is 2020. But there is no caution that it hasn't played out and the leadership at ProMedica firsthand will tell you that they're under wound with the execution as well. So no question, it hasn't played out. And the second -- but if you think about it, again, I would recommend you, it's hard to say things, easy to say things sort of looking back I would like you to go back and to the call where I've described why we did this transaction, and we'll see how much we emphasize that we fundamentally think everything goes away, what we still have is the basis. Think about Steve as I mentioned, that you have a 2-bedroom apartment in New York City where cost it costs everybody $1 million bucks, but you bought something for $400,000 doing JC. You don't need to charge the rent that everybody else is charging. That is the fundamental idea of how you make money will stay without taking a lot of risk. And that's what we saw, and that has played out, hopefully, you'll agree in this transaction. Nikhil, do you want to add anything to the second part of the question?\nNikhil Chaudhri: Yes, I think from a clinical programming perspective, I think this portfolio ManorCare ProMedica has always been good at providing good clinical programs, and they work closely with hospitals across different markets, whether it's for medical hospitals or not in creating programming that serves the need for the local hospitals. And that programming stays in place. And obviously, as new operators come in, they'll decide if they want to keep that in place, scale that back, enhance it. But this whole platform has been known to have incredible clinical programming and that stays in place.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rogers with Baird.\nDavid Rodgers: Yes, maybe for John Burkart. John, as you obviously grow occupancy in the SHOP portfolio, you have more and more assets that are likely now at kind of stabilized occupancy. Can you talk about the margins at the stabilized assets? And if they stabilize to pre-COVID levels. And then any delay between the occupancy stabilization and margin that you're witnessing in that larger group of assets?\nJohn Burkart: Yes. Let me just give you an interesting piece of data. One of our operators that has very high occupancy in the 95% actually had expenses going backwards. And so you see some tremendous margin improvement there. The whole portfolio is going that way. And no doubt that the higher occupancy levels, as Shankh mentioned, was pushing able to push rents to achieve higher rent, which is, again, then driving better margins. But on the expense side, we continue to see opportunities to improve as we go forward and move out of the situation during COVID. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one of the situations during COVID was there's a challenge to get some maintenance done, get people into the buildings, et cetera, et cetera. So our numbers today even reflect some elevated maintenance expenses, which will be reduced over the coming quarters and again, provide a stronger run rate. So yes, things are going very good. They're going good at all levels. The -- as Shankh mentioned, we have maybe four buckets of assets with different levels of occupancy across the board and at the top occupancy assets. We're achieving fantastic margins as you get down the run, obviously, that's not the case, but we're continuing to improve occupancy and things are all looking forward. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. No, I appreciate all the color on ProMedica. I guess maybe one question on the senior housing side for the ProMedica. Was there any discussion of potentially moving that to another operator or you guys are pretty comfortable with how they're performing?\nShankh Mitra: As Tim mentioned, those assets actually a decent amount of profitability for them. And ProMedica, that is part of ProMedica strategic, obviously, planned, and those are, as you know, high margin businesses, and they have been even before COVID and we expect they will continue to come back to -- remember, where pre COVID assets on mid-80 to person occupancy was generating high 30% margin. So I expect as you sort of come back from the COVID and get that occupancy stabilize. Frankly speaking, I will venture a guess that will be the best sort of margin part from all of ProMedica's businesses.  So look, I mean, that's where we stand today, and there's no reason to believe that those assets will not. As you can see, as part of this recovery from these occupancy levels in the business, margins are coming back. I'm not happy with where margins are today, and we're seeing obviously a lot of signs of improvement that we discussed. But the margin of this business should come back to a much higher level, and ProMedica should enjoy that like everybody else in the business.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. I'll provide some insight into our operating business, starting with the medical office portfolio. In the third quarter same-store NOI growth for our outpatient medical business was 1.4% over the prior year's quarter which was below trends, due to some timing issues on tenant improvements, delaying moving and higher utility expenses. We continue to see strong retention levels at 93% in the quarter and accelerating renewal rates in the marketplace. Turning to our senior housing operating portfolio, the recovery in the sector continues. As Shankh mentioned, revenue in our same-store portfolio came in at 10.8% in the third quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. All three regions showed strong revenue growth starting with Canada 4.4%, the U.S. and UK growing in an impressive 11.6% and 18.9% respectively. Revenue growth for the quarter was driven by a 390 basis point increase in occupancy, and another quarter of healthy pricing power with REVPOR growth of 5.3%. As Shankh mentioned the highest we've witnessed. Sequentially, the portfolio occupancy continued to improve with a gain of 110 basis points during the quarter. While expenses remain a challenge, our operators continue to control expense for or expense per occupied room. The cost for compensation per occupied room only grew at 4.3% in the third quarter over the prior year's quarter. The lowest growth rate since 2019. Expense for grew at a rate of 3.7% in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, well below our REVPOR growth and 5.3%, driving expansion of 130 basis points on a year-over-year basis in our margins. As our operators have pivoted from the COVID state to normalized operations and as labor and materials have become more available, we have aggressively addressed maintenance that was delayed during COVID. Which resulted in slightly elevated repairs and maintenance during the maintenance expense during the quarter. Overall, the quarter's occupancy gains strong REVPOR an expense controls enable the senior housing operating portfolio to deliver 17.6% year-over-year same-store NOI growth in the period led by the U.S. with over 20% year-over-year growth. While Canada NOI grew at 6.3% and UK was up 9.8%. Going forward, we expect the operating portfolio to continue to deliver outside NOI growth with each geography expected to experience accelerating NOI growth in the fourth quarter. As we look forward to what many believes will be a weaker labor market in 2023, it's important to realize that labor as an expense represents about 60% of our total expenses. Additionally, nurses are only about 5% of the labor force at the communities. And although there are other more specialized positions at the communities, most of the physicians require skills that are transferable from other sectors of the economy, allowing us to benefit from the softer labor market, as Shankh noted. Regarding our operating platform, we continue to quickly move forward on plans to pilot our first module in early 2023 with several other modules in the works. Like all technology rollouts, it's about people, processes, data, and then technology. So it's not about flipping a switch, it takes teamwork. The results will show up over time. Our meetings with our operators have been very productive as we bring together their skills and experience with our own to build a better future for the industry. Finally, I would like to thank our operators and their employees for making these results possible. It's been a full sprint since the beginning of COVID. And they have addressed one challenge after the next. We are finally at a point where it seems like there's light at the end of the tunnel. Occupancy continues to rise, net hiring is occurring month after month. REVPOR continues to outpace expense for which will drive further margin expansion, and so much more. We wish to thank everyone and wish them a wonderful Thanksgiving. And thank you for your hard work. I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Yes. On your question regarding the flu, I most certainly can't predict the future. But what I can say is that the COVID protocols, I think, will mitigate the situation within our community, they're still in place. I was at one of the properties very recently, and I'm waiting in line to get in, we wash hands, temperature check, wear a mask, et cetera. And I'm going to align with employees any vendor, all of us. That's the protocol. It's a safe, thoughtful protocol. And so my expectation is that, that will have a very positive impact in the communities, how the flu season goes in the U.S. and otherwise, I don't -- I can't predict that. But I do think the COVID protocols will be very positive going forward. There naturally are different margins starting out. But I think that the endpoint will change. I think what we're doing with the operating platform will change that across the board and because AL has perhaps might say more opportunity, though the impact might be slightly greater there. But I think the whole business is going in the right direction at this point in time. And I think we're benefiting across the board. Yes. Let me just give you an interesting piece of data. One of our operators that has very high occupancy in the 95% actually had expenses going backwards. And so you see some tremendous margin improvement there. The whole portfolio is going that way. And no doubt that the higher occupancy levels, as Shankh mentioned, was pushing able to push rents to achieve higher rent, which is, again, then driving better margins. But on the expense side, we continue to see opportunities to improve as we go forward and move out of the situation during COVID. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one of the situations during COVID was there's a challenge to get some maintenance done, get people into the buildings, et cetera, et cetera. So our numbers today even reflect some elevated maintenance expenses, which will be reduced over the coming quarters and again, provide a stronger run rate. So yes, things are going very good. They're going good at all levels. The -- as Shankh mentioned, we have maybe four buckets of assets with different levels of occupancy across the board and at the top occupancy assets. We're achieving fantastic margins as you get down the run, obviously, that's not the case, but we're continuing to improve occupancy and things are all looking forward. So hopefully, that answers your question."

            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to describe our capital allocation priorities, ProMedica Senior Care transaction and the rapidly evolving capital markets environment. I will also review some high-level business trends before handling the call over to John, who will provide details on operational trends and a brief update on our operating platform. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since we last spoke 90 days ago, despite a flattish earnings trends on a sequential basis, driven by several existing headwinds, including FX, interest rate and utility expenses, our underlying business is actually improving meaningfully and setting up for the coil spring recovery that we hoped for. In our senior housing operating business, same-store revenue is up 10.8% year-over-year, driven by strong occupancy gains, and most importantly, pricing power. 5.3% same-store rate growth is the best we have seen in our recorded history and I want to remind everyone that we're compounding already industry-leading rate growth from last year. From these early trends, I believe you will see a further improvement in Q4, which will create a strong setup for 2023. However perhaps what I'm most excited about is the progress we're making on the labor front with compensation for occupied unit is up 4.3% year-over-year, the lowest level of growth we have reported since the beginning of pandemic. Our operating partners are experiencing a significant surge in applications, which has translated into strong increase in net hiring. In fact, in September, total portfolio monthly contract labor spend was the lowest since August of 2021 and subsequently improved in October. We believe this trend will continue into year-end outside the normal pickup agency use during the holiday season and into well into the next year. We strongly believe the labor market is changing for the better, and it will help our sector to be a total standout amongst all real estate sectors next year on a relative basis. SHO portfolio same-store NOI growth was 17.6% in the quarter, led by U.S., which posted third quarter of 20-plus percent growth and assisted living product reported same-store NOI growth of an impressive 25.1%. Let me highlight three operating partners for you, that provide further insight into why I'm so pleased with our progress over the last 90 days. Number one, Oakmont. As you recall, we transitioned 10 top California assets to Oakmont in August while we expected some initial disruption to occupancy NOI during that transition. In actuality, we recognized an immediate benefits due to remarkable performance from Courtney's team. These assets have experienced a slight increase of NOI and occupancy despite challenges that are normally incurred during a transition. This is the first time I've seen a transition with no negative P&L impact, apart from the six assets we transition to Oakmont last year. I expect these properties as well as the other assets that we transition to Oakmont to add significantly to our 2023 growth. If you're visiting San Francisco this month for NAREIT Conference, I recommend you to join our property tour and experience firsthand the remarkable job this team has done. To my earlier point on shift of labor market during the summer, open positions across Oakmont platform was 16% of total jobs. It is down to low single-digit at this point. Number two, StoryPoint. StoryPoint is one of our best operating partners perhaps will be the source of biggest NOI swing next year, with a billion dollars of investment with low occupancy properties, which is generating approximately 2.7% yield in Q3. StoryPoint made remarkable improvement a top line on both occupancy and rates, but the properties have not generated a significant NOI in 2022, as these properties were just over the breakeven occupancy and agency cost was very detrimental. Their open positions are now down more than 50% through the end of October and we expect 80% reduction of agency by the end of this month. We believe that stabilized NOI for this group of portfolio is about circa $80 million, which will be substantially achieved in 2024. While will not close this gap in 2023, I expect will make significant strides next year, and really over the half year way mark. We cannot be more pleased with execution Dan and the team has pulled off. Number three Sunrise. Sunrise is our largest operator due to a national presence Sunrise experienced significant labor challenges and has had to rely on contract labor for last many quarters. Jack and his team has made remarkable progress in this area over the last 60 days. Contract labor down 52% from year-to-date run rate and I believe sunrise will be the biggest contributor to contract labor improvement in the coming months and quarters. Given strong rates Sunrise benefit from in this incredibly well located Welltower building, we should see extremely strong NOI growth contribution from Sunrise. While we're encouraged - very encouraged by these trends, and our fourth quarter guidance of 21% growth at the midpoint, I'll remind you that we are at the very early inning of senior housing recovery. We'll remain as excited as ever about the growth prospects in coming years and the 80-plus population growth will continue to accelerate and as new construction in the sector will come to come to near a standstill. In fact, 2023 should see 4.5% increase in 80-plus population. As you may have observed only 2,700 units got started in Q3. And frankly, I don't even understand how these people will make any money in development. While new development should continue to come down, assuming people want to develop to make any money. Another interesting phenomenon we're observing is that the thousands of units have been taken offline either because of obsolescence or because of higher and better use like behavioral health. As of 9/30, almost 15,000 units were taken offline on a TTM basis. I also want to highlight consistent and steady performance of our outpatient medical group under Ryan's leadership. Our retention rate for the quarter is a remarkable 92.7% and rent spreads are ticking up into the mid-3. Both new and renewal leases -- for both new and renewal leases, I'm pleased that our weighted average escalators are now about 3%. I'm also pleased that the low interest rate environment and the wall of capital that drove 2% to low 2% escalator seems to be a thing of the past. Kelsey-Seybold, which is our largest MOB tenant, and also represents a very significant portion of the Helmand pipeline was acquired by United Health during this summer. The significant credit upgrade of our largest tenant and our development client represents a meaningful value creation for our shareholders. The most significant change we observed in this, however, in the MOB space, is the remarkable widening of cap rates. I've stayed like a broken record for a long time that MOB cap rate made no sense to us, given where the forward view of inflation was relative to underlying growth rate on the cash flow. I'm pleased to see other capital sources are now waking up to the ugly realities of real return on capital in this inflationary environment. There was nothing wrong with this asset class except price. And I relieved to see that has finally changed billions of dollars of transactions were consummated at low cap rate, often which short-term floating rate debt, the party's over with - is over with capital structure and cash flow, as many of these vehicles are now upside down. We'll be observing the space closely in coming months and quarter. Now, I would like to discuss our recent restructuring of a lease with ProMedica health system. I'm not going to bore you with the details our fundamental thesis of this investment in 2018. I laid it out, clearly when we did this transaction, we didn't predict COVID and the impact and its impact on the cash flow portfolio, and frankly, were underwhelmed by the execution. But the fundamental investment thesis of the original transaction should still protect our shareholder's capital, that basis, and appropriate structure are critical to any real estate investment. While we have historically relied on our operatively to drive cash flow and that yield, we never make real estate investment decision based on yield. We believe success in real estate investment over a long period of time, is a function of right basis and staying power. If you own an apartment in New York City for $400,000, while everybody owns equivalent apartment for $1 million, you can still charge rent for that unit and generate strong returns. That is such a simple yet perhaps one of the most overlooked concept on Wall Street. The cacophony of noise around ProMedica as negative dark coverage over the last few months have reached a fever pitch. And we honestly understand and empathize with this Pavlovian response as the history of healthcare REIT sector is full of remedies, such as massive red cards, or disposal of assets at fire sale prices that result in significant value destruction to shareholders. Even though I'm personally humbled by the cash flow deterioration in the ProMedica portfolio, let me repeat that we are not experiencing a rent cut on a cash basis, and our investors are the beneficiary of a satisfactory total return to date. And that goes back to an incredibly favorable basis and structure. To continue my metaphor previous metaphor, Manhattan apartment rents might come down from 5000 to 4000 in a bad year, but we never hypothetical even charged 4000 as we bought our unit at such a low price. That is why our rent is now going up not down after this transaction. And I continue to believe it remains below market and will be a source of future value creation. As I mentioned in our last call, ProMedica has made significant strides in reducing its operating losses, which are farther narrow the last 90 days to both occupancy gains and lower labor cost contract labor costs particularly. Integral or its parent entity which we have done multiple transactions previously, has successfully executed many turnarounds, including those involving at our assets and we sold it to them in last couple of years and is well positioned to return these assets to its previous glory using a regional operating strategy, just like they have done over the last couple of years. We are looking through integrates parent entity and the owner for the downside protection through subordination of their equity as well as significant other guarantees and will subsequently share significant value creation with us. But I cannot overemphasize that the fundamental idea of below market rent basis equals to below market rent is not about ProMedica, it is about our belief how we invest and protect our shareholder's capital. If a business has demand growth, and you can own it for significantly less than what it costs to build, the low leverage capital structure, it is challenging for me to see how lose money in most scenarios. We remain partner with ProMedica, albeit on its surface on a much smaller scale and we'll be delighted to see the significant credit improvement of this important institution in Toledo. Finally, let's discuss the current capital markets environment, which excites me to no end. Before I go into what we might do in the future, let's discuss what we have done in the past under this leadership team. If we go back and read all our comments about capital deployment in the last few years, you will notice a few attributes, one, was unlevered IRR buyers and we underwrite significant cap rate expansion at exit. Hence, the recent rate increase doesn't fluster us, just as we have never chased low rates down under the guise of low cost per capital. Two, our unrelenting focus on basis relative replacement cost, and as a result, we seriously dislike low cap rates in stabilized occupancy scenarios. Nothing has happened so far, even in this turbulent capital markets backdrop that require us to change how we invest capital. We are experiencing historic volatility in the treasury market, in every part of the -- with every part of the yield curve inverted right now, with significantly the most important two to 10 curve is as inverted as it was during Paul Volcker's time 40 years ago. One approach for us would be to ride out the storm in a shelter and do nothing. But those of you know as well, know, we're unlikely to do so. We maintain a fairly favorable capital position and a war chest due to our extremely talented capital markets team under the leadership of Tim. Despite our unfavorable public cost of capital on a spot basis, today, we have no dearth of global institutions who want to partner with us. And let me remind you, again, a simple capital allocation framework I've described to you before. Every company effectively has four choices of raising capital, one, tapping internal cash flow, two, issuing debt, three, issuing equity and four, disposition of existing assets. It also has five essential choices of deploying that capital. One, investing in existing assets, two, acquisitions, three, buying debt at a discount, four, paying a dividend and five, buying stock at a discount. You can loosely call the first set of choices as selling, but the right description would be sourcing or raising capital, you can loosely call the second set of choices as buying, but perhaps the correct description will be deployment of capital. Following the same line of thinking loosely speaking, consistently, buying low and selling high creates value for shareholders. In a more wholesome and thoughtful description, optimizing these choices from this menu of sources and uses in a tax efficient manner, creates meaningful value for continuing shareholders on a partial basis. Our goal is to maximize partial value and partial cash flow, not to become the biggest or the most revolutionary. Our capital allocation team on both sides of the balance sheet is poised to pounce on these great manual opportunities, while the most volatile and interest rate environment in four decades has put in front of us. And at the same time, John's team is just getting started on the journey of cash flow and platform optimization. With that. I'll pass it over to John. John? Thanks, Tim. One of my mentors, Peter Kaufman often says, life is not about predicting, it's about positioning. Did we predict that ProMedica EBITDA coverage will turn negative? Absolutely not. But we positioned for it and structured as such. Did we know COVID will happen and availability of credit in senior housing sector will weaken? No, but we positioned for it. We own more than 11,000 units of age restricted and age targeted apartments that will benefit from government agency backstop financing at very attractive pricing from which we can generate a couple of billions of dollars of proceeds. Did we predict that our stock will be in the low 60s and we'll lose our access to equity capital? No, we didn't. But we positioned for it and raised $3.28 billion of capital at an average price of $86.55 this year. We have no idea if rates are going back down or going back up and how ugly the capital markets environment might turn before it gets better. We're laser focused on what we can control and have an incredible organization that is rallying to take advantage of the opportunities with how thoughts as opposed to gambler thoughts. I cannot be more excited about the period of unprecedented far share value creation that we are embarking on for our existing owners. And with that, I'll open the call up for questions. I'll take the pricing power, John, if you take the flu, that's great. So from a pricing part standpoint, Vikram, if you just look at what we said at the beginning of the year, nothing really changed, except if you think about what happens is in the industry, not at least for our portfolio, you've got a lot of renewals in the beginning of the year. And this year, we got very strong pricing, obviously. And given that the gap between where market rent is as well as where your renewal rates are obviously with the rents that are rolling off, there's a gap over a period of the year that sort of comes down, right, that's sort of what happens in the normal year. What we have said this year, given that market rents have been rising at a faster rate than annual rates, first time, honestly, like a decade. So we have seen that gap close down pretty meaningfully, and you're seeing RevPOR increases are actually getting better through the year. You adds on top of that, that we are seeing some early renewals for next year in that sort of, call it, another 10-ish percent range, and we expect that obviously, we'll do similar type of pricing increases as we come to next year, you will see that pricing power will continue to hold up and RevPOR rate increases will continue to hold up. So we're pretty excited about it. But remember, pricing power also comes in many forms and substances, right? So you have occupancy of the portfolio and many parts of the portfolio is getting to a point overall portfolio might still be at 80% occupancy, but there is segments of the portfolio is well above high 80s and 90% occupancy, where it starts to get pretty meaningful pricing power because you have no innings to sell anymore, right? So as we get into that environment more and more, I believe that you will see sustainable pricing power. I have no crystal ball on exactly what the macroeconomic environment would be next year. But as we sit here today, we feel very good about pricing. Good morning, Derek. I think I laid out pretty clearly what our possible capital deployment opportunities look like, buying back shares is one of them. And frankly speaking, as you know how we think, we are unlevered IRR buyers. And we look at everything from that lens or you can look at from the basis lens, and you will see that we find our stock to be very, very attractively priced, and we'll measure that against every other opportunities we have.  I cannot predict on timing. That's just not -- we just don't do that, as you know. But we know -- you know how we think. We think through a lens basis to replacement cost, and we think through an eye of total unlevered IRR. And if you do those calculations, you will come to the perhaps the same conclusion that we have come through. John, you didn't ask for my opinion, my $0.02 on this topic is that you will see more improvement in AL than IL, but you'll see improvement in both. But you asked the right person, that question. I'm not sure I completely followed that question, but do you think -- I think you asked about the moving trends in the senior's apartment business, if I heard that correctly, I will tell you that \u2013 go ahead, Wendy. Yes. Okay. So I think I understand the question. So look, I mean, if you think about from a product-type perspective, as I mentioned, that the assisted living is going through probably the most robust recovery perhaps for nothing other than the fact that it is the most need-based environment. It's more susceptible, least susceptible to in the macroeconomic environment. When you need it, you need the product when you need it. And obviously, it also fail farther. So we have more rooms to climb back up. So that's why we're seeing the most sort of robust recovery. As I mentioned, the NOI growth in that sector for the quarter was 25-plus percent, right? So that's sort of -- let's just then talk about the senior's apartment business. That business has been as good of a business as any business I've seen has been very strong. Through COVID, it's been very, very strong. Through times, I mean our portfolio is at 95-plus percent occupancy. As you know, we operate in the mid-market portion of that business, which is very dependent on social security and everything else. And you've got a massive cola increase next year, which we also think will be very beneficial for the pricing power increase in that business next year. Independent living, obviously, independent living did not fall as far as assisted living, and it's coming back more slowly. But that is a -- I personally think that's a good business when you combine that with other property types. And I think, obviously, Canada, which is our majority of our independent living exposure, has been so hard to recover, but as John noted, that we are starting to see improvement there. Yes. So Dan, we haven't seen lenders are foreclosing on medical office loans yet. But my comment was if you -- it's just called the convexity of the situation, right, when you have very, very low rates, and people buying cap rates that are in that environment makes sense and then treasury card moves 200, 300 basis points. The treasury cards sitting on top of or above the cap rates that you are paid that's a prior upside down convexity situation, and that's the comment I was making, it takes time for lenders to foreclose, it takes time.  But we are starting to see some meaningful increase in the cap rates there, which is interesting. We're not yet to talk about whether we are going to look at that and execute on that yet. We have lots of opportunities that we see on a relative basis. We talked about, obviously, senior housing is one of those. Nothing changed. I'm specifically pointed out in MOBs because that has changed. Senior housing as an opportunity was there for last 18 months and when executing on it, nothing changed there, right, and continues to be super attractive. On top of that, to the earlier question Derek asked, our stock isn't really attractive.  So we look at every opportunity and think about what's the unlevered IRR on a risk-adjusted basis and what's the sort of execution risk as well as obviously the frictional cost that comes with the execution risk. But is the way finally first time in years has become interesting. And yes, but it's interesting at a price. And that price is likely a lot lower than most what you think. On the consideration, it's roughly half and half. The reserves are earmarked for the operating losses, working capital losses and that reserve will go to them to improve the quality of the portfolio. So if they do a good job and don't need all -- that's good for them. So they share the risk and they get the benefit of their savings there. Tayo, extraordinarily good question, and thank you for your comment there. I'll just add one thing to that not only the rent is going up also the previous tenant being close to $0.5 million on the table. To make sure that these properties are taking care of going forward. So we think our partner for that. So I'll just add to the question of why we didn't go and find the offers. Our mantra is to get close to the operators, but that's in the senior housing business. I fundamentally believe in the expertise, and we have worked with Integra and its parent company on many of these transactions before. There's no caution that they are significantly better in the skilled nursing business than we are aware and will ever be. So we are sharing and for creating that value, I've mentioned in my script that we're seeing very significant upside that they can create with them. And return, they're providing us the downside protection, which is very important for us. So you think about it, you got to do in life, what you are best at. Think about from an op standpoint, we think we understand operations of senior living, the wellness housing business as well as MOB business. And we want to partner with people who we fundamentally believe on the other hand, are very good in other businesses, and that's what you're saying. Fundamentally, it is sort of going through the decision-making is going to the people who are the best at what they are good at. At the same time, it sort of cut the risk reward in terms of who creates value. It's just as simple as that. As I've said before, you can see the value still remains at very attractive basis, what you can get to.  You know the total rent, you know what market sort of rent sort of constant of significant business is, and you can divide it to a value and you will see that value is still extraordinarily attractive and thus, the rent is extraordinarily attractive and remains below market. So there will be hopefully a lot of upside as the regional operators bring this portfolio back to his previous Glory, which we actually -- this is not a guess. We have -- we kill how many assets we have transacted, Medicare assets we're transacted with Integra and its parent. About 21, 21 assets. We have seen them doing it. And we are going on an execution path that we have seen in the last couple of years. So fully, there's a lot of value to be created for residents, for employees, for capital, and that will be shared between the two parties. But it is fundamentally the belief of they're giving us the downside protection for which they should enjoy very significant upside that they create -- on the other hand, for us, it's all about where we sit in the risk spectrum.  So it's a win-win-win for all three parties. ProMedica wants to focus on its core business, and wants to be in the higher margin business and that's the leadership that they are taking that forward. There's a very significant improvement in their credit. For Welltower, it's obviously a great day for some value realization as well as, obviously, taking this portfolio to the hands where we can create another round of very significant up step of values. For Integra, they can ping it at a very attractive basis. And obviously, they're creating the value that they will share the upside with us. So it's a win-win-win on all fronts. Very good question. The escalators remain the same, 2.75%. And the GAAP impact, as we mentioned, will be roughly neutral to slightly accretive. One of the leases are remaining the same lease ManorCare, the Aramco senior living lease is going to 10 years. So you have a negative GAAP impact there. So net-net, you will be roughly neutral to slightly attractive. So can you please repeat the first part of your question again? So look, it is no secret that we have been thinking about in the industry that we have been thinking about this particular portfolio for a long time. We have been approached by at least five parties who are interested in being this transaction similar or higher value similar or higher structures. We went with a partner that we know very well, where we felt the execution risk is much lower. But I think if you have heard that you have correctly heard that we have been approached by many groups because these assets are not only very attractive assets, they have very good history, but also the basis remains very, very attractive. Going back to 2016, '17, I think your question was to exit the SNF business. I -- we are very clearly laid out two years ago when I took over as CEO we have a very simple strategy that we want to make money on a risk-adjusted basis on a partial basis for our existing shareholders. That's the strategy, and it's a very simple strategy whether it's skilled nursing, whether it's medical office or the senior apartments, whether it's senior housing, what is debt to equity, value-add development, opportunistic will go anywhere we can find opportunities to make money on a partial basis for existing shareholders. That's a simple strategy. One extraordinarily good question. As you know, we get really excited about basis and were USD, we raised capital in USD, our expenses are mostly in USD, capital structures and USD. And we think about basis in terms of USD. And as you can figure out, U.K. on a U.S. dollar basis has never looked more attractive and Canada also looks pretty attractive. But U.K. particularly given what happens to the currency situation, it's extraordinarily attractive. If you add on top of that, that you don't have a super functioning debt market in U.K., like you have the agency support in U.S. and Canada. It's a very, very interesting market. I have never seen U.K. opportunities as cheap as it looks today from the U.S. dollar investor. And that probably perhaps goes for any asset class, anything even for shoppers. So you're picking up the right thing, we're absolutely thinking about it. Yes. So our basis remains the same, and you can do the calculation on -- again, you have the total rent. You know what the give or take yield is in the business. And you can get to the total value, rent divided by the yield give will get you the value. You can divide that by the total number of beds, and you will see Integra basis are also very attractive. So our basis remains attractive. Remember, what we sold to Integra is what we got for ProMedica for nothing. So it's important for you to understand the nuances of what's happening here. So our basis remains very attractive. Obviously, we got the support for the operator who is living and living, as I mentioned, living close to $0.5 billion on the table. We created another structure where that 15%, which Integra is paying for remains subordinated that further lowers our net basis, which is the first time when you remember, I talked about that, that condition remains, we have obviously other guarantees in place, as I said. And if that's not the case, remains -- remember, in the last question, I said that people want these assets because they're very well-located assets, and a very good location and the very attractive basis. So we don't see, as I said, look, anything can happen, Rich. But as I've mentioned before, four years ago on this topic, that low basis, well-located assets that have demand that's held in low-level structure, it's hard to see how we lose money. Anything can happen, anything is possible. But if you think about we have to leave within the realms of probabilities, not possibilities, it looks pretty good to me. Nick, first, congratulations for getting the top job. We have been a big fan of yours for a long time, and obviously, thank you for your question on the call today. So look, I've mentioned very, very clearly that we do not consider ourselves a skilled nursing expert. If we did, then we would not bring in our partners in this deal, who we consider knows the business better than we do. So I will leave that to our partner to execute the strategy, which we have mentioned, as Nikhil just mentioned, that we have done just from these portfolio 21 assets before, we'll leave it to them to maximize where, in this case, is this sort of a structural protection is what we are after, not maximizing value through operators. That's what they're bringing to the people in this case, and we remain focused on our core businesses, where -- whether it's senior living, whether it's well in housing or medical office, and that's what John is spending all this time. Let me try to address your question, Steve, and then Nikhil, you jump in. First is the fundamentally the strategic part of the patient flow point that you made has not played out. And has it not played out because we walk directly into a very tough environment of COVID or has it not played out because the idea we couldn't execute or ProMedica could not execute. I don't know the answer to that question. Hindsight is 2020. But there is no caution that it hasn't played out and the leadership at ProMedica firsthand will tell you that they're under wound with the execution as well. So no question, it hasn't played out. And the second -- but if you think about it, again, I would recommend you, it's hard to say things, easy to say things sort of looking back I would like you to go back and to the call where I've described why we did this transaction, and we'll see how much we emphasize that we fundamentally think everything goes away, what we still have is the basis. Think about Steve as I mentioned, that you have a 2-bedroom apartment in New York City where cost it costs everybody $1 million bucks, but you bought something for $400,000 doing JC. You don't need to charge the rent that everybody else is charging. That is the fundamental idea of how you make money will stay without taking a lot of risk. And that's what we saw, and that has played out, hopefully, you'll agree in this transaction. Nikhil, do you want to add anything to the second part of the question? As Tim mentioned, those assets actually a decent amount of profitability for them. And ProMedica, that is part of ProMedica strategic, obviously, planned, and those are, as you know, high margin businesses, and they have been even before COVID and we expect they will continue to come back to -- remember, where pre COVID assets on mid-80 to person occupancy was generating high 30% margin. So I expect as you sort of come back from the COVID and get that occupancy stabilize. Frankly speaking, I will venture a guess that will be the best sort of margin part from all of ProMedica's businesses.  So look, I mean, that's where we stand today, and there's no reason to believe that those assets will not. As you can see, as part of this recovery from these occupancy levels in the business, margins are coming back. I'm not happy with where margins are today, and we're seeing obviously a lot of signs of improvement that we discussed. But the margin of this business should come back to a much higher level, and ProMedica should enjoy that like everybody else in the business."

            "name": "Tim McHugh",
            "content": "Thanks, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2022 results. Performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet liquidity update, and finally our outlook for the fourth quarter. Welltower reported third quarter normalized funds from operations of $0.84 per diluted share, representing 6.2% growth over the prior year period when adjusted for HHS funds received and changes in FX rates. Marking our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth since the start of the pandemic. We also reported our second consecutive quarter positive total portfolio same-store NOI growth, the 7.2% year-over-year growth. Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6, 30 2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 1.6% year-over-year, below the low end of our guidance range, which is primarily timing related. Trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is 0.83 times in the quarter. Next, same-store NOI and our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3.1% year-over-year, in trailing 12 month EBITDA coverage of 1.31 times. And lastly health systems, which comprise of our joint venture with ProMedica Health System. Had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month EBITDA and EBITDAR coverages were negative 0.01 and negative 0.6 respectively, as operations continue to be impacted by higher agency utilization costs in the second quarter relative to the prior year. What are these coverage figures in context of our announcement last night, trailing 12-month ProMedica senior care EBITDAN coverage of negative 0.01 implies trailing 12 month EBITDAN of negative $1.6 million relative to $106.68 million of cash rent paid in the trailing 12-month period ending 6, 30 2022? The transition of the skilled nursing business will bring the remaining ProMedica senior care EBITDAN back to profitability with the trailing 12-month coverage of nearly two times relative to the remaining rent and the 58 assisted living facilities they will continue to operate. Thus, the transition to Integra Health has a dual benefit providing us a well-capitalized strategic partner to focus on the skilled nursing properties while also leaving ProMedica senior care a substantially better financial state following the transaction. Turning to the capital market activity. In the quarter we continue to enhance our balance sheet strength by utilizing our ATM program to raise approximately $760 million afford equity an average price of $80.12. We settled 9.1 million shares for total proceeds of at $842 million to fund $1 billion of net investment activity, leaving $1.5 billion of unsettled forward ATM as of 9, 30. Post quarter end, we settled additional ATM proceeds to fund investment activity and pay down $850 million of total debt. $817 million of which was floating rate. Post that pay down, we have the full $4.0 billion available borrowing capacity on our line of credit, and no one secured maturities until 2024. We expect to finish the fourth quarter with consolidated net-debt-to EBITDA below 6.5 times for the first time since 2020. From liquidity perspective, in addition to $4 billion, we pass in line of credit we have $1 billion of cash and forward equity and $580 million remaining near term dispositions and loan pay down proceeds and a 4.6 yield representing $5.6 billion of total near term liquidity. Lastly, moving to our fourth quarter outlook. Last night, we provide an outlook for the fourth quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders, of $0.08 to $0.13 per diluted share, and normalized FFO of $0.80 to $0.85 per diluted share, or $82.5 at the midpoint. As mentioned in the release, our fourth quarter guidance contemplates no HHS funds to be received in the fourth quarter. So after adjusting for $1.5 of non-recurring items, including HHS funds receiving the third quarter were effectively flat for sequential FFO. The sequential change is composed of $0.02 from sequential increases in senior housing operating portfolio and $0.01 from sequential increases in outpatient medical and senior housing triple net. These are offset by $0.03 of interest expense and foreign exchange headwinds. Underlying this FFO guidance, is estimated total portfolio of year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8.5% to 10.5%. Driven by sub segment growth of outpatient medical, 1.5% to 2.5%. Long-term post Q 2.5% to 3.5%. Senior housing tripled net, 5% to 6%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 18.5% to 23.5%. Driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.5% year-over-year. Underlying this revenue growth, is expectation approximately 200 basis points of year-over-year occupancy increase and rent growth approximately 7%. And with that, I'll hand the back the call back over to Shankh. Yes, I'll start with the first comment on the margin side. The assumption is we get back to pre-COVID levels. So no assumption on change in margins. We assume we get back to pre COVID level profitability and operating margins of about 30.8% across the portfolio. Yes, Michael, I appreciate recognition that we're trying to help just the ramp or the kind of trajectory of how that cash flow comes through and it depends on the type of development. So we think about our -- where a lot of our starts have been as of late is more in the senior apartments to on the housing side. And there, you're talking about more 12, 18 months type ramp towards stabilization in the traditional senior housing side, it's more of a 24, 36-month ramp. And that's where more of the lower yields negative by able to come in the first 12 months."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Chantal, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  Matt McQueen, General Counsel. You may begin.\nMatt McQueen: Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review high-level business trends and describe our capital allocation priorities before handing the call over to John, who will detail the operational trends and provide more details on the operating platform that he is building. Our total revenue is up 29% year-over-year, driven by both organic revenue growth and contribution from significant capital deployment activity over last 18 months. On a same-store basis, our senior housing operating portfolio revenue is up 11.5% year-over-year, driven by a 5% occupancy growth and a 4.5% REVPOR growth. All this translated into a 15.4% same-store NOI growth in Q2. Our annual EBITDA is back above $2 billion. Annualized in-place SHOP NOI is at $895 million.  Though shy of $923 million of pre-pandemic numbers, our revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. However, I'm not happy with these results, which I would characterize mediocre at best. Why? Because the size of our portfolio is much bigger today, given the significant amount of capital deployment over the last 18 months and yet our quarterly results are not reflecting the cash flow that this portfolio is capable of generating. I'll give you a few things to reflect on. First, we have about 120 senior living -- senior housing properties that are generating negative cash flow today. In other words, if we just shut down these buildings, our earnings would be significantly higher. Clearly, we would not do such a thing as they were recently developed or going through a value and repositioning program. Hence, the timing mismatch.  Second, while I don't like to fix it on short-term trends and instead focus on long-term prospects of the business, I'll offer a few observations on the second quarter. We started the quarter with results coming in better than expected, only to get hilt simultaneously by multiple challenges primarily related to another COVID spike during the last couple of weeks of June. Only this time, we didn't see it coming as the testing requirements have been lowered in recent months, particularly for those residents who are not experiencing symptoms. In instances where few residents or team members develop symptoms and an entire building would be tested only to find out many asymptomatic residents and staff actually were COVID positive. This created some disruption to move-ins, but particularly impactful to the use of agency labor in June. Our operators are walking through as we speak and made very good progress in July.  Let me dig into some recent trends even a bit more. From a demand standpoint, we always see first half of July as two last weeks, similar to the last weeks of December as families celebrate 4th of July weekend and don't usually move parents and grandparents in. This July, we lost an additional week. And as a result, almost a whole month was shut from a move-in perspective before we gain significant traction later in the month with tour activities returning to the levels experienced in June. We and our operators have a few theories of why that might be the case. One, the hyper-positivity rate of COVID over 20%. Despite people on a reporting to government, families know from home testing they're COVID positive and are delaying move-ins as they wait for this wave to subside. And number two, travel. Summer travel has surged as families took advantage of looser COVID restrictions. Again, I would describe this as our conjecture because we don't know for sure. But we are clearly seeing broad-based demand recovery continues, particularly towards the second half of the month in terms of leads and tours, which led to a recent rebound in move-ins across the portfolio over the last couple of weeks. On the cost side, it is important that you understand the progress we made on the agency labor. In the U.S., most of our operators are decreased from June to July, resulting largely from a favorable net hiring trends. The July books have not closed yet, we're expecting a decline in agency labor expense in high-single digit from month of June. In terms of net hiring, our operators have continued to make significant momentum with July increase alone in headcount nearly equal to the net hires of past six months of the year combined. As a result, we're already starting to see benefit of this trend, which should reduce the dependence on agency labor in the second half of the year. The downside of high-frequency data is that you get a lot of noise. And I strongly believe that's what you're seeing in the numbers today, a lot of noise. I encourage my team and will encourage you not to confuse any short-term high-frequency noise whether good or bad as a signal and project that into the future prospect of the business. For a few quarters, I've been talking about the run rate earnings or the true earnings part of this portfolio being significantly different from our current reported earnings. Clearly, some of the anticipated second half growth has slipped into the next year, but this should only be a timing mismatch. As we focus on '23 and '24, I continue to believe that this earnings power will shine through. Before I move on to the capital allocation priorities, let me make a comment on ProMedica. When we bought HCR ManorCare portfolio out of bankruptcy, we did not outsource our underwriting to rating agencies. Clearly, there was no way for us to predict a global pandemic or a day when almost every hospital system in the country would lose money similar to what happened in Q1 of this year because of COVID. We got comfortable because our basis of $57,000 per skilled nursing bed, we saw very minimal risk of permanent capital loss, which is at the core of how we think about risk. Of all the structuring bells and whistles aside, which we're very proud of, we fundamentally believe investment basis not cash flow in a given building at a given point in time determines investment success. Having said that, the ProMedica team has been able to make reduced agency labor almost by half over the last four months and significantly narrowed their operating losses. We have below market basis, and thus, below market rent here. I remain very comfortable with our rent and longer-term expected IRR from this investment that we discussed with you when we did this deal four years ago.  Turning to the capital deployment. I cannot overstate how favorable of an environment we find ourselves in today. During the second quarter, our off-market, privately negotiated transaction machines kept humming, having deployed an additional $1.1 billion of capital. Today, there is definite stress in the lending environment given the significant rate and credit volatility and increasing recession talk. Cap rates are going up across the board and most institutional capital is waiting to see where the chips fall. We're seeing many high-quality opportunities, and we think the environment will only get more favorable as Fed continues to raise rate at a rapid clip. Our pipeline remains robust, having replenished after all of our Q2 and Q3 closings. Our fundamental investment thesis remains intact. One, we need to buy at a favorable basis relative to replacement cost; and two, we need to be able to add value through our platform. We're not spread investing deal junkies and instead remains laser focused on total return or unlevered IRR. I continue to believe this year will be a record year for Welltower from a capital deployment standpoint.  Cost of capital has surged for everybody, including governments and access to capital remains very sparse for most people. In this environment, we remain in a very favorable capital position with $2 billion-plus of equity capital that is raised but not settled and almost full availability of our $4 billion line. Sellers who did not like our price six months ago are realizing that glossy broker package and nonbinding LOI are not cash in a bank. This environment reinforces the value of a counterparty like Welltower, which always acts on a very simple principle. We say what we do and we do what we say. And in that vein, as our long-term investors have come to expect from us, we exercise utmost discipline on every transaction we look at, large or small and will not chase any deal. As we have said in the recent past, price is the price, and we only act in a manner that creates long-term value for -- part share for our owners.  With respect to capital deployment over the last 18 months, some of you have asked me if I'm satisfied with the performance of these properties. In many cases, in the case of many of these acquisitions, including some larger ones, the answer is no. The same-store challenge that I have described above are accentuated in many non-same-store properties, which are being repositioned through operator changes. However, I do believe that we have turned the corner as we approach the completion of our operator transition and system integration for the COVID class of acquisitions. We should see significant progress from these properties as we enter next year. Please recall, we make investment decisions based on long-term IRR with an exit cap rate going up every single year from the duration of the ownership. And we feel strongly about achieving those return targets as we have discussed with you. As frustrating as near-term challenges of operator transition might be for reported earnings and trust me, I share those frustrations with you, we have to do what's right for long-term interest of our owners. I will give you two examples. Vintage and Gracewell, two of the most ill-fated HCN acquisition from many months ago. Despite some of the most coveted locations and CapEx plans, these assets did not live up to our expectations. We finally pulled the plug over last 12 months, frankly, because we're not permitted to do so earlier. Our Gracewell assets were transferred to Care UK and the Vintage assets were mostly transferred to Oakmont with one each to Kisco and Cogir. Oakmont has already made incredible progress with the first tranche of the asset they received last fall, with occupancy up 13%, and I believe you will see this repeated in the most recent tranche as well. Care UK is having similar success with Gracewell assets taking occupancy above 80%. And I believe they will be stabilized or get close to it in 2023. We made similar decisions for our other properties, which come with some short-term pain. But as we capital allocators strive every day to create per share value by compounding over a long period of time, while we hope near-term priorities do not conflict with those long term, practically speaking, we often encounter situations where those time horizons diverge. And it is critical for our investors to understand that at these crossroads, we'll always follow the path to long-term value creation at the expense of short-term gains. The good news is that -- all of these, as my partner, John Burkart, would say, is baked in the cake.  With that, I'll hand the call over to John, who will describe to you perhaps the most exciting set of initiatives that will transform the business as we know today and creates tremendous value for our residents, team members, operating partners and most importantly, our shareholders. John?\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will touch upon the performance of our operating business and provide additional color regarding our vision for senior housing as well as an update on our platform initiatives.  Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the second quarter, our outpatient medical business sequentially increased occupancy by 30 basis points and delivered 2.5% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter. We continue to see strong retention rates over 89% in the quarter, good demand and rising new lease rates. Now turning to our senior housing operating platform -- portfolio. The recovery in the sector continues. As Shankh mentioned, revenue in our same-store portfolio accelerated to 11.5% in the second quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. All three regions showed good revenue growth led by the U.S. and UK with growth of 13.1%, 14.7%, respectively. The revenue for the quarter was driven by a 500 basis point increase in occupancy and another quarter of healthy rate growth. Sequentially, the portfolio increased occupancy 100 basis points during a period in which sequentially average occupancy has historically been slightly negative. While expenses grew at a rate of 10.5%, our operators continue to control [EXPOR] or expense per occupied room, which only grew at a rate of 3.5% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. And as Shankh indicated, we're encouraged by recent trends in terms of agency hiring and new hiring, which we believe should drive a deceleration in the second half expense growth. Despite short-term challenges driven by COVID, the tight labor market and inflationary pressures, the portfolio delivered 15.4% year-over-year same-store NOI growth in the period, the second highest in the company's history with the U.S. portfolio generating over 20% same-store NOI growth. Going forward, we expect the portfolio to deliver outside NOI growth over a multiyear period with strengthening supply and demand backdrop compounded by our efforts to optimize the business, which I'll get to shortly. Regarding the overall market, the traffic this summer has been influenced by COVID in various ways. For example, the traffic was very good in June and then fell significantly as expected for the 4th of July weekend and continue to remain low until it accelerated in the last couple of weeks of July We had total July traffic was about equal to total June traffic. We expect to increase traffic in the later part of July to lead to increased move-ins in August. The average occupancy for the portfolio in July was up over 40 basis points in the same-store portfolio. I also want to quickly comment on recent management transitions within the SHO portfolio. As we make adjustments to our operators' portfolios and the related assets are in transition, we appropriately remove them from the same-store portfolio as they tend to underperform early in the transition and subsequently outperformed later in the transition which can create noise in the same-store portfolio performance. This is very similar to removing an asset for full renovation. Transitions take substantial amounts of time from the point of notice to the actual transition of management which negatively impacts staffing, sales leads and other operational aspects of the asset. The challenges the new operator faces upon takeover are significant. However, over time, they get resolved. And of course, the assets performance improves over the pre-transition baseline, which is the purpose of the transition to begin with. The fact that we have 59 assets in transition is meaningful and that management is willing to take short-term earnings pain for improved performance in the future. If we had not removed transition assets from the same-store portfolio, our year-over-year NOI growth for the quarter would have been 14.9%. Bottom line, strategic transitions are undoubtedly worth it, and they can drive significant value despite creating near-term noise for the same-store portfolio. Shifting to an update on the operating platform. Previously, I mentioned the opportunity to fundamentally change the growth potential of this business by creating a full-scale operating platform and bringing operational excellence to our senior housing portfolio. In terms of industry life cycle, I would place the senior housing business in the infancy phase, but rapidly transitioning into the growth phase. This is very similar to the multifamily business years ago, whose transformation I witnessed firsthand. Businesses that are in infancy phase of the industry life cycle focus on effectiveness, which is essential. Without it, the business would not be able to exist long term. As an industry transitions from the infancy phase to the growth phase continuing to remain effective as the core objective is essential. However, the winners focus on operational excellence, including efficiency. The analogy that I've used is the diner business of the 1950s. To survive and thrive, you had to serve a good meal, a good burger, fries and shake in the case of the McDonald Brothers. However, to grow as the industry moved from its infancy to growth phase, a focus on operational excellence was imperative, including an obsessive focus on efficiency, which is what Ray Kroc did when he franchised McDonald's. The senior housing operators faced many small business challenges, including the inability to recruit and retain top talent and key functions from technology and data analytics to process and facilities management due to their size and inability to compete from a compensation perspective. Additionally, the fee-based structure limits the economic incentive to fully invest in optimizing the business as an owner-operator would. For example, if a fee manager is paid 5% of revenues, the most they would logically spend to collect $1 of revenue is $0.05, whereas owner operators would theoretically invest $0.99 to collect $1. As you all know, we have worked to change this unfavorable incentive structure through our aligned RIDEA 3.0 contracts. And we are now working on our next generation of contracts that will provide Welltower with a greater ability to help address senior housing operators small business challenges. These challenges are across the board, including basic functions to illustrate in a relatively simple areas such as billing. In the two reviews we performed, we identified that care revenue was underbilled by 25% or more, meaning that the necessary quality of care was provided to the resident. However, they were under billed. Other challenges are much greater, including keeping up with modern consumer expectations such as building-wide, high-speed Internet connectivity, identifying and integrating quality technology systems and creating and delivering real time, insightful and actionable reporting to improve operational results. Focusing on operational excellence is more than a digital transformation. It's about people, processes, data and technology, recognizing that everything starts with people. Our residents living at our communities, the employees serving those residents and the operators leading the effort. We start by focusing on the customer experience and the employee experience and optimizing the various processes. Then we evaluate the data that may -- that we may leverage to draw meaningful insight into the business in a way that improves the experience of the various stakeholders. Finally, we implement cutting-edge technology to simplify and automate the processes as we will provide real-time actionable, insightful information, improving the customer and employee experience while optimizing results. This isn't simply about buying the latest software. It's about fundamentally transforming the business. Over the years, many businesses have transformed from buying books to used cars to buying homes and finding vacation rentals. Digital transformations have fundamentally changed these businesses and improve the overall experience. One of the key imperatives of operational excellence is the recognition that data is the asset. There is no entity in this space better positioned to leverage data than Welltower as we are effectively building the operating platform to improve the overall experience on what we call Alpha, our data analytics platform that has been developed over the last six years. Welltower will improve the customer and employee experience and create shareholder value through leading transformation of the business.  I have gone from full emergence and observation to planning and now action mode. I will not give away all the details of my future playbook, but I will say the following: We are moving very fast. Several recent highlights include forming an internal multidisciplinary team of experts focused on improving the senior housing operations in Q2, hiring a Chief Technology Officer in Q2 to lead the technology aspect of the operating platform, completing the implementation of Welltower's ERP last week, which is central to this effort. And frankly, I want to thank the Welltower team that executed this massive project with great speed and excellent execution. Initiating a data analytics pilot on the correct information that we have available with an expected rollout over the next six months. This step alone will enable us to start driving value. Finally, creating the sales force automation plan with expectations to launch a pilot in early 2023. We have numerous other modules in the works and we'll update as appropriate. Although this is a huge effort, Welltower is uniquely positioned to execute it faster than historically possible. Our strategy is to leverage existing quality modules and only create new modules where they don't exist or where they give us a strategic advantage, such as our revenue management module, which we're developing. Another unique benefit that Welltower has relates to the number of top quality operators in our portfolio. We are separating the pilots of the modules into parallel initiatives, each with a different operator, which will minimize the potential delays that can be caused by a lack of employee bandwidth or overall fatigue and have slowed down other transformations. Ultimately, as we perfect each module, we will then rapidly roll it out to the broader group. This business transformation will continue to deepen and widen the moat Welltower has built while improving the overall experience of all stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\nTim McHugh: Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2022 results, the performance of our triple net investment segment in the quarter, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update; and finally, our outlook for the third quarter. Welltower reported second quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.20 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.86 per diluted share, which included $17 million of Provider Relief Funds from the Department of Health and Human Services, approximately $11 million or $0.02 per share more than was assumed in our initial guide for the quarter. This quarter represented our second consecutive quarter with a year-over-year normalized FFO growth since the start of the pandemic, a positive 8.9% or 7.7% when normalized on HHS funds received and year-over-year changes in FX rates. We also reported our second consecutive quarter of positive total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 8.7% year-over-year growth. Turning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. These statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 9.9% year-over-year, driven by improvements in rent collections and leases currently on cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage increased 0.01x to 0.83x in the quarter.  Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio grew same-store NOI by positive 2.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage is 1.31x. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health system, which had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was negative 0.29x as operation continued to be impacted by high agency utilization in the first quarter. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to capitalize on our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to efficiently fund those near-term transactions. At the start of the second quarter, we sold 18 million shares via forward sale agreement at initial weighted average price of approximately $87.67 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.6 billion. We currently have approximately 22.5 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $2.0 billion. Taken together, our unsettled equity proceeds includes some committed OP units on pipeline deals and $257 million of expected property dispositions and loan payoff proceeds, totaled $2.3 billion in equity capital, providing ample capacity to fund our current investment pipeline. During the quarter, we closed on an amended $4 billion unsecured revolving line of credit, along with an upsized term facility comprised of a $1 billion USD term loan and a $250 million CAD term loan. At quarter end, when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. And when combined with the previous mentioned $2.3 billion of unsettled equity proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we remain in a very strong liquidity position. Lastly, moving to our third quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the third quarter of net income attributable to the common stockholders per diluted share of $0.12 to $0.17, and normalized FFO per share of $0.82 to $0.87 or $0.845 at the midpoint. This guidance includes $7 million with HHS funds expected to be received in the third quarter. Excluding HHS funds, guidance represented a $0.005 increase at the midpoint from 2Q normalized FFO. This $0.005 increase composed of $0.025 from incremental SHO NOI growth and SHO investment activity and $0.01 from performance across the rest of our investment segments and from lower sequential G&A costs. This is offset by $0.03 of higher floating rate interest costs and unfavorable FX rates. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated third quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 7% to 9%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical 1.75% to 2.75%, long-term post-acute of 2.5% to 3.5%, health systems of 2.75%, senior housing triple net of 5% to 6%; and finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 20%, driven by year-over-year revenue growth of 10%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation for approximately 400 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy growth and continued robust rate growth. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of the top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by a combination of rate and occupancy growth.  As I remarked last quarter, as we realize the recovery in our core portfolio, we have made the conscious decision to steadily allocate capital to distress under-operated and often initially diluted properties, along with high-quality development projects. While this capital allocation is the effect of offsetting some of our core growth today, it should substantially amplified in years to come. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. If I may distract you all from the short-term noise and focus on the main drivers of long-term earnings and cash flow per share growth, there are really four large buckets that we must pay attention to: occupancy, rates, labor cost and external growth. In 2021, whenever we're hit by a massive COVID wave, it felt as though we are taking one step forward and two steps back in terms of occupancy, rates and labor costs. Thankfully, the health impact of COVID has been getting more mild and the psyche of the population has significantly improved. Now we are taking two steps forward and one step back in terms of occupancy and labor cost and it appears from the July trends that we're making that one extra step back forward very quickly. So COVID impacts are getting less pronounced and rebounds are getting quicker as we learn how to live with COVID. Despite the reported issues of agency labor, the team member count in our communities has grown significantly off let and we have not seen any let up -- though we have not seen any let up of the cost of labor, there is no question that we have seen the availability of labor increase meaningfully off let. The portfolio has almost the same net hiring in July as we had in the first six months of the year combined. Though our operators have had success in net hiring members over the last few months, as you can see from the case studies on Slide 7 and 8, it appears that the labor market is finally on demand from the significant success of hiring trends in July. Assuming these trends continue, this bodes very well for agency labor cost as we get second half of the year. And where we continue to make the largest strides is through pricing power. The recent COVID spikes have not in any way dulled our operators' ability to push through strong rates. What is particularly encouraging is the Street rates, which are up from high-single digits all the way up to 15%, 20% in case of some large operators. Given the sharp acceleration in growth of the senior population and plummeting new supply of few projects penciling for developers today, our confidence in driving occupancy and rate growth for the next few years continue to strengthen. As for external growth opportunities, our prospects, which have been very good are only getting better, the willingness of owners to transact has grown over the last two years as they struggled with COVID-related challenges and debt maturity. And now with recent surge in borrowing costs and tighter lending standards that are keeping many borrowers at bay. If we overlay all this with how John is fundamentally transforming our business, I have not been more excited of the future prospect of our firm. We know we need to translate all of this into significant higher earnings run rate and cash flow per share and our team, which thinks and acts like long-term owners is hyper focused on that mission.  With that, we'll open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: This is Michael Bilerman here with Griff. Shankh, I was wondering if you can just step back and look, I appreciate the comment about the downside of using high-frequency data and the noise and effectively not to confuse the short term, whether it's good or bad to protect on the future. And you guys have been very all over COVID providing us a lot of business updates. And I think back in June, you use that data to lift guidance, right? And you issued the business update. And so I'm trying to understand whether you're thinking about a change and how you communicate to the Street and the reads that you're feeling, right? Because you took that data and you lifted the Street and you raised a bunch of equity and now things are a little bit lower. And I'm wondering, as you think about that short term, whether it makes sense to really start putting out the building blocks for all these things that you've done, I mean 20% of the portfolio has been bought since the late to 2020 and start to pencil that out on a three- to five-year basis and go through all the building blocks of all the deals you've done, the 120 assets that are negative cash flow and all these things to try to model out where that future growth really is because of all of these, what you call them noise today?\nJohn Burkart: Yes, Michael, I'll start with that and then Shankh can come in. I think the point on NAREIT and the guidance change there, I think Shankh spoke to this in the script. But we've tightened guidance at NAREIT based upon the trends that we saw and those trends reversed towards the end of the quarter and up towards the lower end of that range. So I hear you on the high frequency of data and frankly, what we've been trying to do give updates because the longer-term view has been tougher to project. And given COVID is a backdrop, right? And we've been trying to balance essentially since we've been able to be able to provide less of that long term need to provide more of that short-term information. And I will speak for Shankh, if you can give a comment on this. But I think part of the commentary on the short-term noise is just trying to see the long-term trends continue to be strong in the recovery side. And we're certainly focused on that, and we continue to evaluate that piece of it. And although we understand the market's need for frequent updates on data, we're trying to make sure that you see how we're looking at it and keeping our long-term focus on kind of the core fundamentals of the business.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. I'll just add one thing, Michael. As I mentioned, if you look at when we got hit by BA.5, second half, it was about a week after NAREIT. And that impact, which is sort of followed through about the middle of July. And you probably have noticed that we provided another business update a few weeks ago, is to make sure that everybody knows that our view has changed because of things that we talked about NAREIT. So there was another business update, not just the ones that you mentioned. So we have -- we provide information as investors know. They see what we see. But fundamentally, as I mentioned in my last quarter call that all our -- we tell you how we think, but if we get hit by a COVID wave, are better off. I mentioned that in the last call, I mentioned that in five calls before that, and that continues. The good news here is with every passing wave, we're seeing the impact is lessening. And we're seeing the rebounds are getting faster. But the fact of the matter is we just went through one and rather we're sort of coming towards the tail end of one. And we have no way to project how and when we're going to see COVID in our communities. That's just not what we can do, and I'm not aware of anybody else can do. We're just telling you as we are seeing things, but we're hoping at least we're trying to help you understand the fundamentals of the business, right? For example, if you can see, there's a tremendous amount of, obviously, noise on the agency labor. If you look at that was obviously reported quarter of June, we see a pretty meaningful improvement in July. But if you truly see the improvement that we are excited about, it's the net hiring number because July net hiring number doesn't impact July agency numbers, right? It's sort of -- there's a lag between when you hire people versus when they impact your numbers because you got to train them and there's a lag between when you hire them and then they hit the floors, et cetera, right? So we're just telling you what we are seeing. And it's important that we communicate if trends change because of COVID and otherwise. But we -- I hope that you appreciate that we remain transparent, and we report things to you as we see things. And if things change, things change.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: So maybe, Shankh and John, Tim, as well, I just want to kind of take the pricing power comments you echoed and just think about leaving costs aside, as you mentioned, COVID comes and goes, it's tough to predict. But would it be unfair or reasonable to say given what you're seeing on the bumps, the re-leasing spreads, as we head into '23, given demand supply, pricing power should only accelerate, and I should not be surprised if we see call it, a mid- to high single-digit REVPOR growth for a couple of quarters? And lastly, can you just translate that pricing power into your latest thoughts on margins in the senior housing space?\nShankh Mitra: Vikram, I'm not going to get into sort of giving you guidance on pricing power in particularly for next year's pricing power. But I will tell you that we are seeing that Street rates are significantly accelerating. There has been talks -- not talks. I mean I was in the UK for a few weeks. Our UK operators are talking about giving a midyear pricing increases in September, October time frame. I've not seen that before. There are some talks of U.S. operators thinking about something of that nature. But most importantly, Street rates are just going up very significantly. So all this should translate into continued pricing power in our portfolio, especially if you look at next year, demand supply is even more favorable, right? But we're trying to optimize the revenue growth and frankly, so from our standpoint, we think that pricing power should continue. As you can appreciate that we had pricing power last year, right? So we obviously had REVPOR growth. We continue to push that, and we'll -- as we move forward, you'll see that we'll continue to push that pricing power. As I've suggested before, the two types of pricing power that you should see. Frankly speaking, the one you are seeing today is arises from the need of pushing pricing because of cost inflation, and that's sort of we're sort of going through that. But as we stabilize different buildings, you will see another set of pricing power which is we're raising prices because we don't have a lot of rooms to sell, right? So hopefully, you see a lot of that going through next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.\nDaniel Bernstein: I just wanted to ask something quickly about the differences in labor cost growth between AL, mem care and IL wellness and how that's factoring kind of into your capital allocation of what you want to buy and invest in?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So on the wellness side, there's not a lot of cost, right, on the people side. So you don't have that. Though, I will say that sort of cost mostly driven by taxes as well as the energy cost increase. Our capital allocation is not driven by what we think of labor. You can just price that in. It is driven by what is the opportunity set, was the price relative to what the replacement cost is. So that's how we think about it. And if we have to think -- let's just say that you come with this idea that labor cost is going to be high forever, which I don't think is going to be the case. Labor cost has been a problem for this industry for a very long period of time. And as I said, who are finally probably see that it's on the map, right? We'll see whether -- how that plays out, but we'll likely probably see the first sort of shot across the bow. But you can absolutely price that in. We're price-driven investors, not necessarily. So we take some thematic ideas and just run with it because you can price that in. Hopefully, that's helpful then.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: Could you just talk about the recurring CapEx spend trajectory. I see it is expected to kind of more than double through September from last year's pace. Is that higher spend due to some deferred or lower spending in the past few years during lockdowns and we're just catching up? Or much higher construction costs, a bit of both? And then kind of an extension of that, how that CapEx spend should trend in the next year and help fuel increased competitiveness of your properties and ultimately, revenue growth potential.\nTim McHugh: Yes, I'll start with that, and then John can add anything. Part of it is, we have been certainly in 2022 playing a bit of catch-up in the costs of senior housing space and just the buildings being less accessible over 2020 and 2021. And then efficient for us a lot of the acquisitions we've made have had substantial value-add opportunities. So we've highlighted that with some of the larger ones and explicitly stated how much kind of redevelopment capital or value-add capital we put into it. But I think that's what's driving that right now is a combination of a little bit of deferred or catch-up capital from a period of time in which the buildings were for safety reasons less accessible. And on top of that, we put a lot of capital to work into opportunities that have high return value-add investment.\nJohn Burkart: Yes. And I'll just add. You're actually pulling something from a certain sense from a future script because I talked about the operating platform. The next initiative that I'm focusing on in a big way or workflow really relates to capital and internal investments, what I'd call it as how we reposition the portfolio, our senior housing business portfolio age is at the absolute sweet spot, just right under 20 years old on average, providing tremendous opportunities to reposition those assets. So I'm actually building out a capital team right now, and we will align our CapEx with our value-add initiatives and drive pretty substantial value over the coming three to five years. So it will be a very big effort, and we're at the very front of that effort right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt: I'm just curious for the 120 senior housing facilities currently generating negative cash flow, what is the NOI drag from those facilities. Can you give us what percent of the $538 million of total NOI upside in SHOP that they represent? And do you expect them to stabilize at a faster pace than the overall portfolio?\nShankh Mitra: Well, Austin, we're not going to give you a number on how much capital -- how much cash flow that's losing today? Maybe I'll talk to Tim and see if we can kind of quantify that for you. Should they grow faster, the answer is obviously, yes, right? They are losing money because they're at a lower occupancy. And as they stabilize over, say, a number of years, just from the base they're coming out of, and if you think about the trajectory of the margin, they should grow faster. But a lot of these properties have been recently built or we bought the properties at a very, very low occupancy, right? So if you look at the last tranche of, for example, the StoryPoint acquisitions we did, I think the average occupancy was like 40%, right? So if you think about it, average age of the portfolio, I think that we bought is between 2 to 4 years, and they're at 40% occupancy. So there's no question there's a lot of those buildings that opened in last year, 1.5 years, and we bought a lot of these things, right, from developers from multifamily developers from banks. They're just a drag. But the point here is they're not a sequential sort of a linear progress to your NOI growth, right, as they go from a negative sort of margin to the margin inflection and that sort of margin grows after you hit the J curve, right? So that's sort of the way to think about it. I mentioned that for you to understand that something very simple, right? Just take an example of our East 56th Street property. That property opened 7.5 months ago. It's what? It's probably low 30% occupied today. And our average rate of those residents that we have received, of the people who are living there is $23,000, $24,000, okay? Clearly, that has negative margins. But you would think about it as we thought about that property when we developed it, we're getting significantly high rates and trajectory of East sub is doing better than we thought. Still that's a negative value add. So as you think about negative value, as you think about putting a multiple on our income understand that you are valuing 120 buildings at a negative value. That's all, right? So I'm not going to add anything more to that at this point, but something to just reflect on what's sort of dragging on our earnings and cash flow today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: On John Burkart's operational initiatives, what's his team hoping to accomplish and really to build confidence these endeavors can bear fruit. How are you guys measuring success? And what's the upside here?\nJohn Burkart: The measuring success -- actually, let's go back to what I hope to accomplish is, again, really bringing modern processes, technology, et cetera, to the business. And to give you an example, a very specific example. So one of the things I tested when I came in as I tested how we respond to our customer, customer experience. And what it found out after about 200 customer inquiries, was that 50% were never returned. And of the 50% that were returned, the average time was about 13 business hours. So if a family member needs help on a Monday, and my father falls or something like this and I decide he needs to go into assisted living. I might get a call back on a Wednesday or I might not ever. That's a horrible experience and that is a very solvable situation. If you look at the current CRMs that are in place, they're basically relying upon the salespeople inputting data. It's like I write a sticky note. I put it in a file. That's my CRM. It's glorified because it's electronic, but it's the same thing. So for example, I went to one of our large operators and gave them their results, which were six out of six calls did not get returned, six out of six, zero return and they said, \"Gee, I'm shocked because I'm looking on my desk at our report, our pretty report, PowerPoint report that shows that 85% of the phone calls that come in, we respond to it an hour.\" So that's shocking, but this is all something that we can work ourselves through because you can just test it yourself. I said, but first, tell me how does that get reported. And he said, \"Well, it gets reported because our salespeople report it themselves.\" Well, therein lies the issue. The tracking systems weren't in place, et cetera, et cetera. It's really a bunch of sticky notes from a receptionist that get lost and picked up by the janitor and the calls get lost. So that's the type of professionalism that we're going to apply to the business, and the results will be to the financial benefit, most obviously, increased occupancy, increased rates and a better overall experience for the consumers. So that hopefully answers the question. As far as the details and time lines, we're obviously not giving that out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: I appreciate the case study pages showing that you're hiring in recent months. I guess I still don't have a sense for the magnitude of understaffing, assuming occupancy starts climbing. So to the extent we get positive surprises on the occupancy upside is next six to 12 months, are you going to have to lean on agency expense to kind of meet that demand? Or do you think properties on average or staff properly right now to handle additional occupancy?\nShankh Mitra: I think, John, that's a very fair comment, which I should -- we talked about July was obviously a very positive month for net hiring. And we hired -- for the portfolio overall, our operating partners have hired as many people in July as they did six months ago. But what we haven't told you that hiring puts us finally to a 2% plus above what the total number of employees were last year. We should have added that. It's a fair question -- comment from year end. So as you recall, this whole agency sort of cost drama started about a year ago, and we have finally worked our way through that with this July hiring we're finally about 2% above where total employee count was on a net basis above last year. So what you're saying is possible, but I would say probably unlikely as we are finally seeing, as I said -- I talked a little bit about that that -- our operators have been talking about the overall availability of labor is increasing in June, it feels like, again, I'm going to be very careful how I describe it because it is not that we know everything that's happening. But it feels like that finally that labor market is on the mend from -- at least from an availability, for sure, it's on the mend. And hopefully, that translates into price of labor in not a distant future, but at this point, at least, we're hopeful -- not just hopeful, we're seeing it in the numbers that agency lever, which were obviously pretty ugly number in June, but came down in July. And hopefully, obviously, there's net hire numbers in July, you'll see that should impact pretty positively as we get towards the end of the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: I wanted to actually touch on the study that you just answered, but I guess the -- just to frame it slightly differently, not to get redundant here. What percent of total open positions across all the senior housing were filled in July? If you think of it that way, are we talking 75%, nearly 100%. I think that's 2% above where you were before, it's still kind of hard to, I guess, frame that perfectly in our own minds. So another thing is just on the double staffing, what's the typical time period of training where you have that double staffing? Are we talking weeks or months? Just any rule of thumb would help around that, too, as we think of magnitude of potential expense reduction for 3Q versus 4Q, et cetera?\nShankh Mitra: So net hiring in July was about 3%, just about 3% of total employee count. And you should think about the second half of your -- of course, you should think about weeks, not months. So July higher should impact August and September sort of agency numbers. There is a case study that you can see on Page 7 and 8. Page 8, we'll show you, this is an interesting case, right? Page 7 and 8 has two large operators, which constituted roughly half of our agency labor costs. Page 7 would show you an operator who has already made the strides and the cost has come down meaningfully. Let's just say, call it from a $2 million a month to, call it, $0.5 million a month. Rough numbers in a matter of four months, call it, from April to July. The Page 8 shows you an operator, which actually has it. The numbers have been pretty much flat from June to July. But if you look at the number of hours booked, that has come down pretty significantly which tells you if that trend continues, they should see significant improvement in August and September, right? So we in case take two examples. I want to give you diversity of example and two consequential examples with sort of two constitute of pretty much half of the total cost. But hopefully, that sort of gives you a sense of what we are seeing. Rather than predicting the future, we're sort of giving you the positioning of our portfolio, which probably should help fully translate that into the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: I was wondering, can you tie together the 4.5% on same-store revenue REVPOR growth? And maybe talk a little bit about the sequential trend there relative to Q1? And can you dissect a little bit and talk about roll downs and just, I guess, pricing by unit type?\nTim McHugh: Yes, yes. And I will -- on the REVPOR side, I think the way to think about it is we talked about this last quarter, but we get a large amount of -- half of our portfolio roughly resets on Jan 1. So you see that occurred -- that part of the portfolio actually happened to also be heavily weighted towards our higher acuity unit types. The Jan 1 increases tend to be the daily billers. The daily billers are the part of the business that have your higher acuity assisted living weighting. So you saw those increases in the first quarter and what you're seeing now kind of spreading from the first quarter to the second quarter is we've talked about in this business, historically, you've seen kind of 10% or high single-digit roll-downs between move-in and move-out rates. A lot of it's acuity related, but that's actually -- that got as wide at 20-plus percent last year and it started to tighten into the mid- to low single-digit range. So you're seeing some of those Jan 1 increases I'd say bleed off a little bit with there is still some negative leasing spreads on that, and that's being offset by annual increases that are hitting throughout pretty much evenly throughout the year and the other half of the portfolio.\nShankh Mitra: And as I mentioned, my last call, right, if you have pretty much a scenario, which we haven't seen in a long time, which is if Street trade continues to go up, the way it is going up, that gap will continue to narrow. And sort of it is conceivable that they come very close. We have seen a couple of operators where actually it has crossed over. But there's a portfolio-wise, it is conceivable that they come very, very close and that negative re-leasing spread that comes from the acuity clip that Tim talked about goes away. And so but remember, what we are also talking about, this is sort of a problem that you chase again as you raise -- you send the in-house increase letters again, right? So and you change that number again, right? So this is a phenomenon. But frankly speaking, we haven't seen in a long time, eight or nine years where Street rates are getting very close to in place. So we're pretty encouraged by that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Rodgers with Baird.\nDavid Rodgers: Shankh, you and Tim both mentioned ProMedica, I think, in your prepared comments. And you went through some of the coverage ratios and agency labor statistics and basis. But I was kind of curious the fact that you spent a little bit more time this quarter. Was that just related to where their coverage has gone and you're reiterating comfort with that? Or are you having conversations or have they approached you about maybe making changes? I guess that would be the first question. And the second question is what about that portfolio relative to the other portfolio that you own? -- has made them kind of lag in some of the recovery statistics that you've mentioned.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So I'm going to be -- I'm going to repeat what I said before. First is to understand, a lot of that portfolio has a skilled nursing, which has been impacted, obviously, very significantly. And it has been a very significant hit from agency labor in that portfolio. What we report is a one-quarter lag sort of a four-quarter average type of EBITDAR.  What I mentioned -- if you look at -- reread the transcript, you will see that the improvement that they have seen has happened really in the last four, five months. And that they have significantly narrowed their loss as occupancy has gone up and agency labor has come down, right? So that's sort of the overall underlying picture of what's happening.  It is very important for you to understand, as we have described before, that rent doesn't come from the four-walls of [indiscernible], right, that rent -- with the only reason we did that transaction, -- they -- and we mentioned this before, that rent was guaranteed by the market share, right? So that's very important for you to understand where that lies. As I mentioned again, I'm going to say this again, as I've mentioned before, right? We fundamentally believe that below-market basis translate into below-market rent, like there's nothing -- there's no special insight into that. If you have a low basis and your market rent constant, you will get to a level by market rent, right? So on an average basis, for example, on the average bed rate, the ProMedica portfolio is roughly around $7,000 per bed of rent. If you look at any other skilled nursing provider, let's just take an example of Omega, you will see the average rent is about $10,000, right? So that sort of gives you a sense of if everything was exactly the same, the rent is 30% below, right? So they sort of give you order of magnitude. I'm not talking about specific because it's hard to compare assets from portfolio one to portfolio two, but that would give you a sense, which gives us a lot of comfort that about, a, first, our income from that portfolio; and b, what we strive to do, which is to achieve long-term returns as we deploy capital. And as I mentioned, I'm going to mention it again, I remain very comfortable that we're not losing our sleep over that income or that return from that portfolio. That\u2019s all I am going to say.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNicholas Yulico: I was just hoping to understand for the operator transition assets in senior housing. What's embedded in the guidance for the third quarter about any incremental sequential NOI drag there since I think you said those assets are not in the same-store calculation.\nTim McHugh: Yes, correct. They're not in the same-store. So the assets, just to clarify, the assets that we -- in our July business update, that we talked about transitioning. Those are still in the same-store portfolio, they completed the quarter in -- under the management of the prior manager. And then they're coming out going forward. From a sequential basis, we expect a slight drag from a [build] perspective, about 0.5% from those transitions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRichard Anderson: So I think we all get the message here on the short term versus the long term, but I want to see if I can get some kind of quantitive evidence of that. So the occupancy guide for the third quarter is 400 basis points year-over-year, and that seems to imply 120 basis points sequentially, which compares to 100 basis points sequential in the second quarter. So we didn't get the seasonal pop in occupancy and understand for the reasons you described. When you were sitting in your seat at NAREIT and you were thinking about the third quarter at the time, how much do you think we lost by virtue of what happened with the COVID wave in June and the kind of the lost month of July? And where do you think the sequential number, landing at 120 basis points as of now, would have been, if not for the disruptions that you faced after NAREIT?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So let's just -- I'll take the essence of your question, and there's no debate about the fact that for -- specifically for third quarter, and I mentioned this in my script that some of the growth has leaped into next year because we're not getting that growth in the third quarter. Why? Because we lost the month of July, right? So if you lose your traffic that much in first half of the month, it's very, very -- it's almost impossible to recover from that as you think through the sales cycle of tours translate into sales, right? So it's very important for you to understand that last month with sort of -- it's a very important month, right? So we got an average occupancy growth in that month, as John said, about 40-plus basis points, there should have been double that. And that's was not the case because we got hit. So the only good news here, as I will suggest to you, and I think John mentioned this in his script, that we started first, call it, first 10 days, first 15 days of July, but tours were 40% below June, like with just the market just went away. By the time we ended the month, we caught up on a cumulative basis almost to the 95% of June. So if you think about, you start at a 40% hole, and you end up at a 5% hole, that sort of suggest to you, there's a remarkable progress made in the second half. And that's sort of we're seeing that now the move-ins are coming back on back of the tours. But by no question, but absolutely no question, Rich, that we -- because of this COVID hits are sort of, just call it, try to be specific on something that it can be that we saw between mid-June to mid-July, has hit our June numbers on an expense basis, which sort of recovered in July or at least hopefully recovered a lot in July, and it hit revenue because all the tours went away. It hits revenue in July. I hope that sort of gives you a sense of how this wave hit us and how that translates from one side of the quarter from the other side of the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: John, I know you're hesitant to provide too many details on your data plan, but I wanted to touch on your comments in your prepared remarks that Well is initiating on a data analytics pilot that's expected to roll out over the next six months. I guess what does this actually mean? And how does this different from the company's current data analytic programs that you have right now?\nJohn Burkart: Yes. So, it's better to look at it versus the operating platform. So the operating platform will drive -- will provide tremendous amounts of data because we'll be able to gather all the nuanced information from the web hits the traffic all the way through. But currently, we can gather more information from our operators, and that's really the opportunity that I'm taking midterm is to gather some more. So we've been working with our operators to connect. And in this particular case, we connected with our cloud system to pull down on a daily basis the information that they currently have from the platforms that they're currently using. So we haven't done that level of detail before. We get good reporting from them, but now we're upping that gain. And so from an interim basis, that will inform us much better than we have right now from an operating level the company -- what the company has done from the investment side is untouchable. But from an operating perspective, there's some more opportunities that I'm going after and that should help us from an asset management level.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just a longer-term question, I guess, you noticed some transitions happening and near-term drag for a long-term opportunity. But at this point, how should we think about the risk of further transitions into 2023? Are you confident that we're past 90% of any potential transitions? Or is that just part of the business where there's always going to be some laggards and maybe like I think about kind of Goldman calling 10% of the staff annually. Is that kind of the way we should think about? There's always going to be some underperformer you're going to kind of rectify that as things go? Or is this kind of -- we're at the end of that, given where we are in COVID and cyclically?\nShankh Mitra: So Juan, I think the way you should think about it for the COVID class of acquisitions that we have done, the transition, operator transition, system integration, all of those things are reaching nearing completion, right? So they are nearing completion. Now from the perspective of what you are asking, which is more of a philosophical question than a planning question, right, we are of the belief that you have to earn your keep if you want to manage our properties. It's very simple, right? Managing our properties, which had substantial amount of capital is a given. And you see that in all other businesses, whether it's a competitive business, whether just take an example of multifamily, right? And if you look at people who are managers, fee managers, they expect to earn their right to manage for fee. And frankly speaking, in senior housing business, there has been very significant amount of complacency, and we have not seen that. So as long as people perform, we have absolutely no desire to move assets because it's disruptive. No one wants to do that. But if people don't perform, there will be transition. It's a lot of capital -- for our shareholders' capital are tied up into these buildings, but we're not going to see it tear and take underperformance. That's just not what we do. Near-term underperformance because something happened to an asset completely understandable. But as John mentioned to you, some of the basic operating standards are expected. And if people don't perform, they're not going to be in our portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: It's Bilerman, again. I just had two quick follow-ups. Shankh just on ProMedica, who is funding the operating cash flow losses today? Or is the entity just taking on increased debt for that? So maybe you can just talk through the capital structure and how all of that's happening. And then secondarily, just going back to my opening question about sort of longer-term and focusing on all of the initiatives and investments that you've made, I think Burkart, when you were at Essex, you've put out a three-year plan, and I remember UDR and Aimco and there was a lot of that, do you think the company would benefit a little bit about -- you have done a lot of sending out all of the impacts and opportunities to start to understand the earnings as well as the asset value, NAV, because it just feels that the market is focused to short term and you can provide a lot more details. You've dropped little things like the transition, the $120 million negative cash flow, but actually getting the details and really putting the building blocks to your three-year return based on everything that's involved, I think, would be really helpful. So if you can address those two things, that would be good.\nShankh Mitra: So I answer the first question. ProMedica is funding and the operating cash flows. As you guys know, it's an entity that has -- how their funding is very simple, that entity has really have $2 billion of cash on their balance sheet, so they're just using that cash to fund it. So John, do you want to add anything?\nJohn Burkart: Yes. I mean I will continue to provide more insight into the platform. And as I'm a very simple person, as you know, I call it the [indiscernible]. Literally, we'll start all the way from traffic, i.e., web and that type all the way through sales force management, all the way through the operating platform, the ERP, so to speak through every other aspect of the business, HRIS, et cetera. And we'll start to lay out more information. I will say from the past the -- my experience -- the companies typically aren't laying out specific time lines for dollars. You lay out paths as to what you expect to accomplish and how that will positively impact the business, but not necessarily time to dollars, and I don't intend to do that. But I'm glad to give more clarity over time. We're running extraordinarily fast at this point in time, and we'll provide some more detail on the coming calls and at NAREIT, et cetera.\nTim McHugh: And Michael, just a continuation to answer to your first question. I think overall, you should certainly hear from us that we've adapted the way that what we've disclosed over the last 2.5 years in a pretty dynamic environment. So a lot of it has been driven certainly by what we think is important. And a lot of this has been driven by feedback from individuals with yourself and investors. So I hope you've seen that and certainly continued to have dialogue with the market on what is helpful to be seen, and we'll continue to adapt what we disclose based upon that. So you shouldn't think there'll be any change in the way that we -- our approach to that.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will touch upon the performance of our operating business and provide additional color regarding our vision for senior housing as well as an update on our platform initiatives.  Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the second quarter, our outpatient medical business sequentially increased occupancy by 30 basis points and delivered 2.5% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter. We continue to see strong retention rates over 89% in the quarter, good demand and rising new lease rates. Now turning to our senior housing operating platform -- portfolio. The recovery in the sector continues. As Shankh mentioned, revenue in our same-store portfolio accelerated to 11.5% in the second quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. All three regions showed good revenue growth led by the U.S. and UK with growth of 13.1%, 14.7%, respectively. The revenue for the quarter was driven by a 500 basis point increase in occupancy and another quarter of healthy rate growth. Sequentially, the portfolio increased occupancy 100 basis points during a period in which sequentially average occupancy has historically been slightly negative. While expenses grew at a rate of 10.5%, our operators continue to control [EXPOR] or expense per occupied room, which only grew at a rate of 3.5% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. And as Shankh indicated, we're encouraged by recent trends in terms of agency hiring and new hiring, which we believe should drive a deceleration in the second half expense growth. Despite short-term challenges driven by COVID, the tight labor market and inflationary pressures, the portfolio delivered 15.4% year-over-year same-store NOI growth in the period, the second highest in the company's history with the U.S. portfolio generating over 20% same-store NOI growth. Going forward, we expect the portfolio to deliver outside NOI growth over a multiyear period with strengthening supply and demand backdrop compounded by our efforts to optimize the business, which I'll get to shortly. Regarding the overall market, the traffic this summer has been influenced by COVID in various ways. For example, the traffic was very good in June and then fell significantly as expected for the 4th of July weekend and continue to remain low until it accelerated in the last couple of weeks of July We had total July traffic was about equal to total June traffic. We expect to increase traffic in the later part of July to lead to increased move-ins in August. The average occupancy for the portfolio in July was up over 40 basis points in the same-store portfolio. I also want to quickly comment on recent management transitions within the SHO portfolio. As we make adjustments to our operators' portfolios and the related assets are in transition, we appropriately remove them from the same-store portfolio as they tend to underperform early in the transition and subsequently outperformed later in the transition which can create noise in the same-store portfolio performance. This is very similar to removing an asset for full renovation. Transitions take substantial amounts of time from the point of notice to the actual transition of management which negatively impacts staffing, sales leads and other operational aspects of the asset. The challenges the new operator faces upon takeover are significant. However, over time, they get resolved. And of course, the assets performance improves over the pre-transition baseline, which is the purpose of the transition to begin with. The fact that we have 59 assets in transition is meaningful and that management is willing to take short-term earnings pain for improved performance in the future. If we had not removed transition assets from the same-store portfolio, our year-over-year NOI growth for the quarter would have been 14.9%. Bottom line, strategic transitions are undoubtedly worth it, and they can drive significant value despite creating near-term noise for the same-store portfolio. Shifting to an update on the operating platform. Previously, I mentioned the opportunity to fundamentally change the growth potential of this business by creating a full-scale operating platform and bringing operational excellence to our senior housing portfolio. In terms of industry life cycle, I would place the senior housing business in the infancy phase, but rapidly transitioning into the growth phase. This is very similar to the multifamily business years ago, whose transformation I witnessed firsthand. Businesses that are in infancy phase of the industry life cycle focus on effectiveness, which is essential. Without it, the business would not be able to exist long term. As an industry transitions from the infancy phase to the growth phase continuing to remain effective as the core objective is essential. However, the winners focus on operational excellence, including efficiency. The analogy that I've used is the diner business of the 1950s. To survive and thrive, you had to serve a good meal, a good burger, fries and shake in the case of the McDonald Brothers. However, to grow as the industry moved from its infancy to growth phase, a focus on operational excellence was imperative, including an obsessive focus on efficiency, which is what Ray Kroc did when he franchised McDonald's. The senior housing operators faced many small business challenges, including the inability to recruit and retain top talent and key functions from technology and data analytics to process and facilities management due to their size and inability to compete from a compensation perspective. Additionally, the fee-based structure limits the economic incentive to fully invest in optimizing the business as an owner-operator would. For example, if a fee manager is paid 5% of revenues, the most they would logically spend to collect $1 of revenue is $0.05, whereas owner operators would theoretically invest $0.99 to collect $1. As you all know, we have worked to change this unfavorable incentive structure through our aligned RIDEA 3.0 contracts. And we are now working on our next generation of contracts that will provide Welltower with a greater ability to help address senior housing operators small business challenges. These challenges are across the board, including basic functions to illustrate in a relatively simple areas such as billing. In the two reviews we performed, we identified that care revenue was underbilled by 25% or more, meaning that the necessary quality of care was provided to the resident. However, they were under billed. Other challenges are much greater, including keeping up with modern consumer expectations such as building-wide, high-speed Internet connectivity, identifying and integrating quality technology systems and creating and delivering real time, insightful and actionable reporting to improve operational results. Focusing on operational excellence is more than a digital transformation. It's about people, processes, data and technology, recognizing that everything starts with people. Our residents living at our communities, the employees serving those residents and the operators leading the effort. We start by focusing on the customer experience and the employee experience and optimizing the various processes. Then we evaluate the data that may -- that we may leverage to draw meaningful insight into the business in a way that improves the experience of the various stakeholders. Finally, we implement cutting-edge technology to simplify and automate the processes as we will provide real-time actionable, insightful information, improving the customer and employee experience while optimizing results. This isn't simply about buying the latest software. It's about fundamentally transforming the business. Over the years, many businesses have transformed from buying books to used cars to buying homes and finding vacation rentals. Digital transformations have fundamentally changed these businesses and improve the overall experience. One of the key imperatives of operational excellence is the recognition that data is the asset. There is no entity in this space better positioned to leverage data than Welltower as we are effectively building the operating platform to improve the overall experience on what we call Alpha, our data analytics platform that has been developed over the last six years. Welltower will improve the customer and employee experience and create shareholder value through leading transformation of the business.  I have gone from full emergence and observation to planning and now action mode. I will not give away all the details of my future playbook, but I will say the following: We are moving very fast. Several recent highlights include forming an internal multidisciplinary team of experts focused on improving the senior housing operations in Q2, hiring a Chief Technology Officer in Q2 to lead the technology aspect of the operating platform, completing the implementation of Welltower's ERP last week, which is central to this effort. And frankly, I want to thank the Welltower team that executed this massive project with great speed and excellent execution. Initiating a data analytics pilot on the correct information that we have available with an expected rollout over the next six months. This step alone will enable us to start driving value. Finally, creating the sales force automation plan with expectations to launch a pilot in early 2023. We have numerous other modules in the works and we'll update as appropriate. Although this is a huge effort, Welltower is uniquely positioned to execute it faster than historically possible. Our strategy is to leverage existing quality modules and only create new modules where they don't exist or where they give us a strategic advantage, such as our revenue management module, which we're developing. Another unique benefit that Welltower has relates to the number of top quality operators in our portfolio. We are separating the pilots of the modules into parallel initiatives, each with a different operator, which will minimize the potential delays that can be caused by a lack of employee bandwidth or overall fatigue and have slowed down other transformations. Ultimately, as we perfect each module, we will then rapidly roll it out to the broader group. This business transformation will continue to deepen and widen the moat Welltower has built while improving the overall experience of all stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Yes, Michael, I'll start with that and then Shankh can come in. I think the point on NAREIT and the guidance change there, I think Shankh spoke to this in the script. But we've tightened guidance at NAREIT based upon the trends that we saw and those trends reversed towards the end of the quarter and up towards the lower end of that range. So I hear you on the high frequency of data and frankly, what we've been trying to do give updates because the longer-term view has been tougher to project. And given COVID is a backdrop, right? And we've been trying to balance essentially since we've been able to be able to provide less of that long term need to provide more of that short-term information. And I will speak for Shankh, if you can give a comment on this. But I think part of the commentary on the short-term noise is just trying to see the long-term trends continue to be strong in the recovery side. And we're certainly focused on that, and we continue to evaluate that piece of it. And although we understand the market's need for frequent updates on data, we're trying to make sure that you see how we're looking at it and keeping our long-term focus on kind of the core fundamentals of the business. Yes. And I'll just add. You're actually pulling something from a certain sense from a future script because I talked about the operating platform. The next initiative that I'm focusing on in a big way or workflow really relates to capital and internal investments, what I'd call it as how we reposition the portfolio, our senior housing business portfolio age is at the absolute sweet spot, just right under 20 years old on average, providing tremendous opportunities to reposition those assets. So I'm actually building out a capital team right now, and we will align our CapEx with our value-add initiatives and drive pretty substantial value over the coming three to five years. So it will be a very big effort, and we're at the very front of that effort right now. The measuring success -- actually, let's go back to what I hope to accomplish is, again, really bringing modern processes, technology, et cetera, to the business. And to give you an example, a very specific example. So one of the things I tested when I came in as I tested how we respond to our customer, customer experience. And what it found out after about 200 customer inquiries, was that 50% were never returned. And of the 50% that were returned, the average time was about 13 business hours. So if a family member needs help on a Monday, and my father falls or something like this and I decide he needs to go into assisted living. I might get a call back on a Wednesday or I might not ever. That's a horrible experience and that is a very solvable situation. If you look at the current CRMs that are in place, they're basically relying upon the salespeople inputting data. It's like I write a sticky note. I put it in a file. That's my CRM. It's glorified because it's electronic, but it's the same thing. So for example, I went to one of our large operators and gave them their results, which were six out of six calls did not get returned, six out of six, zero return and they said, \"Gee, I'm shocked because I'm looking on my desk at our report, our pretty report, PowerPoint report that shows that 85% of the phone calls that come in, we respond to it an hour.\" So that's shocking, but this is all something that we can work ourselves through because you can just test it yourself. I said, but first, tell me how does that get reported. And he said, \"Well, it gets reported because our salespeople report it themselves.\" Well, therein lies the issue. The tracking systems weren't in place, et cetera, et cetera. It's really a bunch of sticky notes from a receptionist that get lost and picked up by the janitor and the calls get lost. So that's the type of professionalism that we're going to apply to the business, and the results will be to the financial benefit, most obviously, increased occupancy, increased rates and a better overall experience for the consumers. So that hopefully answers the question. As far as the details and time lines, we're obviously not giving that out. Yes. So, it's better to look at it versus the operating platform. So the operating platform will drive -- will provide tremendous amounts of data because we'll be able to gather all the nuanced information from the web hits the traffic all the way through. But currently, we can gather more information from our operators, and that's really the opportunity that I'm taking midterm is to gather some more. So we've been working with our operators to connect. And in this particular case, we connected with our cloud system to pull down on a daily basis the information that they currently have from the platforms that they're currently using. So we haven't done that level of detail before. We get good reporting from them, but now we're upping that gain. And so from an interim basis, that will inform us much better than we have right now from an operating level the company -- what the company has done from the investment side is untouchable. But from an operating perspective, there's some more opportunities that I'm going after and that should help us from an asset management level. Yes. I mean I will continue to provide more insight into the platform. And as I'm a very simple person, as you know, I call it the [indiscernible]. Literally, we'll start all the way from traffic, i.e., web and that type all the way through sales force management, all the way through the operating platform, the ERP, so to speak through every other aspect of the business, HRIS, et cetera.

            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review high-level business trends and describe our capital allocation priorities before handing the call over to John, who will detail the operational trends and provide more details on the operating platform that he is building. Our total revenue is up 29% year-over-year, driven by both organic revenue growth and contribution from significant capital deployment activity over last 18 months. On a same-store basis, our senior housing operating portfolio revenue is up 11.5% year-over-year, driven by a 5% occupancy growth and a 4.5% REVPOR growth. All this translated into a 15.4% same-store NOI growth in Q2. Our annual EBITDA is back above $2 billion. Annualized in-place SHOP NOI is at $895 million.  Though shy of $923 million of pre-pandemic numbers, our revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. However, I'm not happy with these results, which I would characterize mediocre at best. Why? Because the size of our portfolio is much bigger today, given the significant amount of capital deployment over the last 18 months and yet our quarterly results are not reflecting the cash flow that this portfolio is capable of generating. I'll give you a few things to reflect on. First, we have about 120 senior living -- senior housing properties that are generating negative cash flow today. In other words, if we just shut down these buildings, our earnings would be significantly higher. Clearly, we would not do such a thing as they were recently developed or going through a value and repositioning program. Hence, the timing mismatch.  Second, while I don't like to fix it on short-term trends and instead focus on long-term prospects of the business, I'll offer a few observations on the second quarter. We started the quarter with results coming in better than expected, only to get hilt simultaneously by multiple challenges primarily related to another COVID spike during the last couple of weeks of June. Only this time, we didn't see it coming as the testing requirements have been lowered in recent months, particularly for those residents who are not experiencing symptoms. In instances where few residents or team members develop symptoms and an entire building would be tested only to find out many asymptomatic residents and staff actually were COVID positive. This created some disruption to move-ins, but particularly impactful to the use of agency labor in June. Our operators are walking through as we speak and made very good progress in July.  Let me dig into some recent trends even a bit more. From a demand standpoint, we always see first half of July as two last weeks, similar to the last weeks of December as families celebrate 4th of July weekend and don't usually move parents and grandparents in. This July, we lost an additional week. And as a result, almost a whole month was shut from a move-in perspective before we gain significant traction later in the month with tour activities returning to the levels experienced in June. We and our operators have a few theories of why that might be the case. One, the hyper-positivity rate of COVID over 20%. Despite people on a reporting to government, families know from home testing they're COVID positive and are delaying move-ins as they wait for this wave to subside. And number two, travel. Summer travel has surged as families took advantage of looser COVID restrictions. Again, I would describe this as our conjecture because we don't know for sure. But we are clearly seeing broad-based demand recovery continues, particularly towards the second half of the month in terms of leads and tours, which led to a recent rebound in move-ins across the portfolio over the last couple of weeks. On the cost side, it is important that you understand the progress we made on the agency labor. In the U.S., most of our operators are decreased from June to July, resulting largely from a favorable net hiring trends. The July books have not closed yet, we're expecting a decline in agency labor expense in high-single digit from month of June. In terms of net hiring, our operators have continued to make significant momentum with July increase alone in headcount nearly equal to the net hires of past six months of the year combined. As a result, we're already starting to see benefit of this trend, which should reduce the dependence on agency labor in the second half of the year. The downside of high-frequency data is that you get a lot of noise. And I strongly believe that's what you're seeing in the numbers today, a lot of noise. I encourage my team and will encourage you not to confuse any short-term high-frequency noise whether good or bad as a signal and project that into the future prospect of the business. For a few quarters, I've been talking about the run rate earnings or the true earnings part of this portfolio being significantly different from our current reported earnings. Clearly, some of the anticipated second half growth has slipped into the next year, but this should only be a timing mismatch. As we focus on '23 and '24, I continue to believe that this earnings power will shine through. Before I move on to the capital allocation priorities, let me make a comment on ProMedica. When we bought HCR ManorCare portfolio out of bankruptcy, we did not outsource our underwriting to rating agencies. Clearly, there was no way for us to predict a global pandemic or a day when almost every hospital system in the country would lose money similar to what happened in Q1 of this year because of COVID. We got comfortable because our basis of $57,000 per skilled nursing bed, we saw very minimal risk of permanent capital loss, which is at the core of how we think about risk. Of all the structuring bells and whistles aside, which we're very proud of, we fundamentally believe investment basis not cash flow in a given building at a given point in time determines investment success. Having said that, the ProMedica team has been able to make reduced agency labor almost by half over the last four months and significantly narrowed their operating losses. We have below market basis, and thus, below market rent here. I remain very comfortable with our rent and longer-term expected IRR from this investment that we discussed with you when we did this deal four years ago.  Turning to the capital deployment. I cannot overstate how favorable of an environment we find ourselves in today. During the second quarter, our off-market, privately negotiated transaction machines kept humming, having deployed an additional $1.1 billion of capital. Today, there is definite stress in the lending environment given the significant rate and credit volatility and increasing recession talk. Cap rates are going up across the board and most institutional capital is waiting to see where the chips fall. We're seeing many high-quality opportunities, and we think the environment will only get more favorable as Fed continues to raise rate at a rapid clip. Our pipeline remains robust, having replenished after all of our Q2 and Q3 closings. Our fundamental investment thesis remains intact. One, we need to buy at a favorable basis relative to replacement cost; and two, we need to be able to add value through our platform. We're not spread investing deal junkies and instead remains laser focused on total return or unlevered IRR. I continue to believe this year will be a record year for Welltower from a capital deployment standpoint.  Cost of capital has surged for everybody, including governments and access to capital remains very sparse for most people. In this environment, we remain in a very favorable capital position with $2 billion-plus of equity capital that is raised but not settled and almost full availability of our $4 billion line. Sellers who did not like our price six months ago are realizing that glossy broker package and nonbinding LOI are not cash in a bank. This environment reinforces the value of a counterparty like Welltower, which always acts on a very simple principle. We say what we do and we do what we say. And in that vein, as our long-term investors have come to expect from us, we exercise utmost discipline on every transaction we look at, large or small and will not chase any deal. As we have said in the recent past, price is the price, and we only act in a manner that creates long-term value for -- part share for our owners.  With respect to capital deployment over the last 18 months, some of you have asked me if I'm satisfied with the performance of these properties. In many cases, in the case of many of these acquisitions, including some larger ones, the answer is no. The same-store challenge that I have described above are accentuated in many non-same-store properties, which are being repositioned through operator changes. However, I do believe that we have turned the corner as we approach the completion of our operator transition and system integration for the COVID class of acquisitions. We should see significant progress from these properties as we enter next year. Please recall, we make investment decisions based on long-term IRR with an exit cap rate going up every single year from the duration of the ownership. And we feel strongly about achieving those return targets as we have discussed with you. As frustrating as near-term challenges of operator transition might be for reported earnings and trust me, I share those frustrations with you, we have to do what's right for long-term interest of our owners. I will give you two examples. Vintage and Gracewell, two of the most ill-fated HCN acquisition from many months ago. Despite some of the most coveted locations and CapEx plans, these assets did not live up to our expectations. We finally pulled the plug over last 12 months, frankly, because we're not permitted to do so earlier. Our Gracewell assets were transferred to Care UK and the Vintage assets were mostly transferred to Oakmont with one each to Kisco and Cogir. Oakmont has already made incredible progress with the first tranche of the asset they received last fall, with occupancy up 13%, and I believe you will see this repeated in the most recent tranche as well. Care UK is having similar success with Gracewell assets taking occupancy above 80%. And I believe they will be stabilized or get close to it in 2023. We made similar decisions for our other properties, which come with some short-term pain. But as we capital allocators strive every day to create per share value by compounding over a long period of time, while we hope near-term priorities do not conflict with those long term, practically speaking, we often encounter situations where those time horizons diverge. And it is critical for our investors to understand that at these crossroads, we'll always follow the path to long-term value creation at the expense of short-term gains. The good news is that -- all of these, as my partner, John Burkart, would say, is baked in the cake.  With that, I'll hand the call over to John, who will describe to you perhaps the most exciting set of initiatives that will transform the business as we know today and creates tremendous value for our residents, team members, operating partners and most importantly, our shareholders. John? Thank you, Tim. If I may distract you all from the short-term noise and focus on the main drivers of long-term earnings and cash flow per share growth, there are really four large buckets that we must pay attention to: occupancy, rates, labor cost and external growth. In 2021, whenever we're hit by a massive COVID wave, it felt as though we are taking one step forward and two steps back in terms of occupancy, rates and labor costs. Thankfully, the health impact of COVID has been getting more mild and the psyche of the population has significantly improved. Now we are taking two steps forward and one step back in terms of occupancy and labor cost and it appears from the July trends that we're making that one extra step back forward very quickly. So COVID impacts are getting less pronounced and rebounds are getting quicker as we learn how to live with COVID. Despite the reported issues of agency labor, the team member count in our communities has grown significantly off let and we have not seen any let up -- though we have not seen any let up of the cost of labor, there is no question that we have seen the availability of labor increase meaningfully off let. The portfolio has almost the same net hiring in July as we had in the first six months of the year combined. Though our operators have had success in net hiring members over the last few months, as you can see from the case studies on Slide 7 and 8, it appears that the labor market is finally on demand from the significant success of hiring trends in July. Assuming these trends continue, this bodes very well for agency labor cost as we get second half of the year. And where we continue to make the largest strides is through pricing power. The recent COVID spikes have not in any way dulled our operators' ability to push through strong rates. What is particularly encouraging is the Street rates, which are up from high-single digits all the way up to 15%, 20% in case of some large operators. Given the sharp acceleration in growth of the senior population and plummeting new supply of few projects penciling for developers today, our confidence in driving occupancy and rate growth for the next few years continue to strengthen. As for external growth opportunities, our prospects, which have been very good are only getting better, the willingness of owners to transact has grown over the last two years as they struggled with COVID-related challenges and debt maturity. And now with recent surge in borrowing costs and tighter lending standards that are keeping many borrowers at bay. If we overlay all this with how John is fundamentally transforming our business, I have not been more excited of the future prospect of our firm. We know we need to translate all of this into significant higher earnings run rate and cash flow per share and our team, which thinks and acts like long-term owners is hyper focused on that mission.  With that, we'll open the call up for questions. Yes. I'll just add one thing, Michael. As I mentioned, if you look at when we got hit by BA.5, second half, it was about a week after NAREIT. And that impact, which is sort of followed through about the middle of July. And you probably have noticed that we provided another business update a few weeks ago, is to make sure that everybody knows that our view has changed because of things that we talked about NAREIT. So there was another business update, not just the ones that you mentioned. So we have -- we provide information as investors know. They see what we see. But fundamentally, as I mentioned in my last quarter call that all our -- we tell you how we think, but if we get hit by a COVID wave, are better off. I mentioned that in the last call, I mentioned that in five calls before that, and that continues. The good news here is with every passing wave, we're seeing the impact is lessening. And we're seeing the rebounds are getting faster. But the fact of the matter is we just went through one and rather we're sort of coming towards the tail end of one. And we have no way to project how and when we're going to see COVID in our communities. That's just not what we can do, and I'm not aware of anybody else can do. We're just telling you as we are seeing things, but we're hoping at least we're trying to help you understand the fundamentals of the business, right? For example, if you can see, there's a tremendous amount of, obviously, noise on the agency labor. If you look at that was obviously reported quarter of June, we see a pretty meaningful improvement in July. But if you truly see the improvement that we are excited about, it's the net hiring number because July net hiring number doesn't impact July agency numbers, right? It's sort of -- there's a lag between when you hire people versus when they impact your numbers because you got to train them and there's a lag between when you hire them and then they hit the floors, et cetera, right? So we're just telling you what we are seeing. And it's important that we communicate if trends change because of COVID and otherwise. But we -- I hope that you appreciate that we remain transparent, and we report things to you as we see things. And if things change, things change. Vikram, I'm not going to get into sort of giving you guidance on pricing power in particularly for next year's pricing power. But I will tell you that we are seeing that Street rates are significantly accelerating. There has been talks -- not talks. I mean I was in the UK for a few weeks. Our UK operators are talking about giving a midyear pricing increases in September, October time frame. I've not seen that before. There are some talks of U.S. operators thinking about something of that nature. But most importantly, Street rates are just going up very significantly. So all this should translate into continued pricing power in our portfolio, especially if you look at next year, demand supply is even more favorable, right? But we're trying to optimize the revenue growth and frankly, so from our standpoint, we think that pricing power should continue. As you can appreciate that we had pricing power last year, right? So we obviously had REVPOR growth. We continue to push that, and we'll -- as we move forward, you'll see that we'll continue to push that pricing power. As I've suggested before, the two types of pricing power that you should see. Frankly speaking, the one you are seeing today is arises from the need of pushing pricing because of cost inflation, and that's sort of we're sort of going through that. But as we stabilize different buildings, you will see another set of pricing power which is we're raising prices because we don't have a lot of rooms to sell, right? So hopefully, you see a lot of that going through next year. Yes. So on the wellness side, there's not a lot of cost, right, on the people side. So you don't have that. Though, I will say that sort of cost mostly driven by taxes as well as the energy cost increase. Our capital allocation is not driven by what we think of labor. You can just price that in. It is driven by what is the opportunity set, was the price relative to what the replacement cost is. So that's how we think about it. And if we have to think -- let's just say that you come with this idea that labor cost is going to be high forever, which I don't think is going to be the case. Labor cost has been a problem for this industry for a very long period of time. And as I said, who are finally probably see that it's on the map, right? We'll see whether -- how that plays out, but we'll likely probably see the first sort of shot across the bow. But you can absolutely price that in. We're price-driven investors, not necessarily. So we take some thematic ideas and just run with it because you can price that in. Hopefully, that's helpful then. Well, Austin, we're not going to give you a number on how much capital -- how much cash flow that's losing today? Maybe I'll talk to Tim and see if we can kind of quantify that for you. Should they grow faster, the answer is obviously, yes, right? They are losing money because they're at a lower occupancy. And as they stabilize over, say, a number of years, just from the base they're coming out of, and if you think about the trajectory of the margin, they should grow faster. But a lot of these properties have been recently built or we bought the properties at a very, very low occupancy, right? So if you look at the last tranche of, for example, the StoryPoint acquisitions we did, I think the average occupancy was like 40%, right? So if you think about it, average age of the portfolio, I think that we bought is between 2 to 4 years, and they're at 40% occupancy. So there's no question there's a lot of those buildings that opened in last year, 1.5 years, and we bought a lot of these things, right, from developers from multifamily developers from banks. They're just a drag. But the point here is they're not a sequential sort of a linear progress to your NOI growth, right, as they go from a negative sort of margin to the margin inflection and that sort of margin grows after you hit the J curve, right? So that's sort of the way to think about it. I mentioned that for you to understand that something very simple, right? Just take an example of our East 56th Street property. That property opened 7.5 months ago. It's what? It's probably low 30% occupied today. And our average rate of those residents that we have received, of the people who are living there is $23,000, $24,000, okay? Clearly, that has negative margins. But you would think about it as we thought about that property when we developed it, we're getting significantly high rates and trajectory of East sub is doing better than we thought. Still that's a negative value add. So as you think about negative value, as you think about putting a multiple on our income understand that you are valuing 120 buildings at a negative value. That's all, right? So I'm not going to add anything more to that at this point, but something to just reflect on what's sort of dragging on our earnings and cash flow today. I think, John, that's a very fair comment, which I should -- we talked about July was obviously a very positive month for net hiring. And we hired -- for the portfolio overall, our operating partners have hired as many people in July as they did six months ago. But what we haven't told you that hiring puts us finally to a 2% plus above what the total number of employees were last year. We should have added that. It's a fair question -- comment from year end. So as you recall, this whole agency sort of cost drama started about a year ago, and we have finally worked our way through that with this July hiring we're finally about 2% above where total employee count was on a net basis above last year. So what you're saying is possible, but I would say probably unlikely as we are finally seeing, as I said -- I talked a little bit about that that -- our operators have been talking about the overall availability of labor is increasing in June, it feels like, again, I'm going to be very careful how I describe it because it is not that we know everything that's happening. But it feels like that finally that labor market is on the mend from -- at least from an availability, for sure, it's on the mend. And hopefully, that translates into price of labor in not a distant future, but at this point, at least, we're hopeful -- not just hopeful, we're seeing it in the numbers that agency lever, which were obviously pretty ugly number in June, but came down in July. And hopefully, obviously, there's net hire numbers in July, you'll see that should impact pretty positively as we get towards the end of the quarter. So net hiring in July was about 3%, just about 3% of total employee count. And you should think about the second half of your -- of course, you should think about weeks, not months. So July higher should impact August and September sort of agency numbers. There is a case study that you can see on Page 7 and 8. Page 8, we'll show you, this is an interesting case, right? Page 7 and 8 has two large operators, which constituted roughly half of our agency labor costs. Page 7 would show you an operator who has already made the strides and the cost has come down meaningfully. Let's just say, call it from a $2 million a month to, call it, $0.5 million a month. Rough numbers in a matter of four months, call it, from April to July. The Page 8 shows you an operator, which actually has it. The numbers have been pretty much flat from June to July. But if you look at the number of hours booked, that has come down pretty significantly which tells you if that trend continues, they should see significant improvement in August and September, right? So we in case take two examples. I want to give you diversity of example and two consequential examples with sort of two constitute of pretty much half of the total cost. But hopefully, that sort of gives you a sense of what we are seeing. Rather than predicting the future, we're sort of giving you the positioning of our portfolio, which probably should help fully translate that into the future. And as I mentioned, my last call, right, if you have pretty much a scenario, which we haven't seen in a long time, which is if Street trade continues to go up, the way it is going up, that gap will continue to narrow. And sort of it is conceivable that they come very close. We have seen a couple of operators where actually it has crossed over. But there's a portfolio-wise, it is conceivable that they come very, very close and that negative re-leasing spread that comes from the acuity clip that Tim talked about goes away. And so but remember, what we are also talking about, this is sort of a problem that you chase again as you raise -- you send the in-house increase letters again, right? So and you change that number again, right? So this is a phenomenon. But frankly speaking, we haven't seen in a long time, eight or nine years where Street rates are getting very close to in place. So we're pretty encouraged by that. Yes. So I'm going to be -- I'm going to repeat what I said before. First is to understand, a lot of that portfolio has a skilled nursing, which has been impacted, obviously, very significantly. And it has been a very significant hit from agency labor in that portfolio. What we report is a one-quarter lag sort of a four-quarter average type of EBITDAR.  What I mentioned -- if you look at -- reread the transcript, you will see that the improvement that they have seen has happened really in the last four, five months. And that they have significantly narrowed their loss as occupancy has gone up and agency labor has come down, right? So that's sort of the overall underlying picture of what's happening.  It is very important for you to understand, as we have described before, that rent doesn't come from the four-walls of [indiscernible], right, that rent -- with the only reason we did that transaction, -- they -- and we mentioned this before, that rent was guaranteed by the market share, right? So that's very important for you to understand where that lies. As I mentioned again, I'm going to say this again, as I've mentioned before, right? We fundamentally believe that below-market basis translate into below-market rent, like there's nothing -- there's no special insight into that. If you have a low basis and your market rent constant, you will get to a level by market rent, right? So on an average basis, for example, on the average bed rate, the ProMedica portfolio is roughly around $7,000 per bed of rent. If you look at any other skilled nursing provider, let's just take an example of Omega, you will see the average rent is about $10,000, right? So that sort of gives you a sense of if everything was exactly the same, the rent is 30% below, right? So they sort of give you order of magnitude. I'm not talking about specific because it's hard to compare assets from portfolio one to portfolio two, but that would give you a sense, which gives us a lot of comfort that about, a, first, our income from that portfolio; and b, what we strive to do, which is to achieve long-term returns as we deploy capital. And as I mentioned, I'm going to mention it again, I remain very comfortable that we're not losing our sleep over that income or that return from that portfolio. That's all I am going to say. Yes. So let's just -- I'll take the essence of your question, and there's no debate about the fact that for -- specifically for third quarter, and I mentioned this in my script that some of the growth has leaped into next year because we're not getting that growth in the third quarter. Why? Because we lost the month of July, right? So if you lose your traffic that much in first half of the month, it's very, very -- it's almost impossible to recover from that as you think through the sales cycle of tours translate into sales, right? So it's very important for you to understand that last month with sort of -- it's a very important month, right? So we got an average occupancy growth in that month, as John said, about 40-plus basis points, there should have been double that. And that's was not the case because we got hit. So the only good news here, as I will suggest to you, and I think John mentioned this in his script, that we started first, call it, first 10 days, first 15 days of July, but tours were 40% below June, like with just the market just went away. By the time we ended the month, we caught up on a cumulative basis almost to the 95% of June. So if you think about, you start at a 40% hole, and you end up at a 5% hole, that sort of suggest to you, there's a remarkable progress made in the second half. And that's sort of we're seeing that now the move-ins are coming back on back of the tours. But by no question, but absolutely no question, Rich, that we -- because of this COVID hits are sort of, just call it, try to be specific on something that it can be that we saw between mid-June to mid-July, has hit our June numbers on an expense basis, which sort of recovered in July or at least hopefully recovered a lot in July, and it hit revenue because all the tours went away. It hits revenue in July. I hope that sort of gives you a sense of how this wave hit us and how that translates from one side of the quarter from the other side of the quarter. So Juan, I think the way you should think about it for the COVID class of acquisitions that we have done, the transition, operator transition, system integration, all of those things are reaching nearing completion, right? So they are nearing completion. Now from the perspective of what you are asking, which is more of a philosophical question than a planning question, right, we are of the belief that you have to earn your keep if you want to manage our properties. It's very simple, right? Managing our properties, which had substantial amount of capital is a given. And you see that in all other businesses, whether it's a competitive business, whether just take an example of multifamily, right? And if you look at people who are managers, fee managers, they expect to earn their right to manage for fee. And frankly speaking, in senior housing business, there has been very significant amount of complacency, and we have not seen that. So as long as people perform, we have absolutely no desire to move assets because it's disruptive. No one wants to do that. But if people don't perform, there will be transition. It's a lot of capital -- for our shareholders' capital are tied up into these buildings, but we're not going to see it tear and take underperformance. That's just not what we do. Near-term underperformance because something happened to an asset completely understandable. But as John mentioned to you, some of the basic operating standards are expected. And if people don't perform, they're not going to be in our portfolio. So I answer the first question. ProMedica is funding and the operating cash flows. As you guys know, it's an entity that has -- how their funding is very simple, that entity has really have $2 billion of cash on their balance sheet, so they're just using that cash to fund it. So John, do you want to add anything?"

            "content": "Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2022 results, the performance of our triple net investment segment in the quarter, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update; and finally, our outlook for the third quarter. Welltower reported second quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.20 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.86 per diluted share, which included $17 million of Provider Relief Funds from the Department of Health and Human Services, approximately $11 million or $0.02 per share more than was assumed in our initial guide for the quarter. This quarter represented our second consecutive quarter with a year-over-year normalized FFO growth since the start of the pandemic, a positive 8.9% or 7.7% when normalized on HHS funds received and year-over-year changes in FX rates. We also reported our second consecutive quarter of positive total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 8.7% year-over-year growth. Turning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. These statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 9.9% year-over-year, driven by improvements in rent collections and leases currently on cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage increased 0.01x to 0.83x in the quarter.  Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio grew same-store NOI by positive 2.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage is 1.31x. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health system, which had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was negative 0.29x as operation continued to be impacted by high agency utilization in the first quarter. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to capitalize on our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to efficiently fund those near-term transactions. At the start of the second quarter, we sold 18 million shares via forward sale agreement at initial weighted average price of approximately $87.67 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.6 billion. We currently have approximately 22.5 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $2.0 billion. Taken together, our unsettled equity proceeds includes some committed OP units on pipeline deals and $257 million of expected property dispositions and loan payoff proceeds, totaled $2.3 billion in equity capital, providing ample capacity to fund our current investment pipeline. During the quarter, we closed on an amended $4 billion unsecured revolving line of credit, along with an upsized term facility comprised of a $1 billion USD term loan and a $250 million CAD term loan. At quarter end, when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. And when combined with the previous mentioned $2.3 billion of unsettled equity proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we remain in a very strong liquidity position. Lastly, moving to our third quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the third quarter of net income attributable to the common stockholders per diluted share of $0.12 to $0.17, and normalized FFO per share of $0.82 to $0.87 or $0.845 at the midpoint. This guidance includes $7 million with HHS funds expected to be received in the third quarter. Excluding HHS funds, guidance represented a $0.005 increase at the midpoint from 2Q normalized FFO. This $0.005 increase composed of $0.025 from incremental SHO NOI growth and SHO investment activity and $0.01 from performance across the rest of our investment segments and from lower sequential G&A costs. This is offset by $0.03 of higher floating rate interest costs and unfavorable FX rates. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated third quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 7% to 9%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical 1.75% to 2.75%, long-term post-acute of 2.5% to 3.5%, health systems of 2.75%, senior housing triple net of 5% to 6%; and finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 20%, driven by year-over-year revenue growth of 10%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation for approximately 400 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy growth and continued robust rate growth. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of the top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by a combination of rate and occupancy growth.  As I remarked last quarter, as we realize the recovery in our core portfolio, we have made the conscious decision to steadily allocate capital to distress under-operated and often initially diluted properties, along with high-quality development projects. While this capital allocation is the effect of offsetting some of our core growth today, it should substantially amplified in years to come. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Yes, I'll start with that, and then John can add anything. Part of it is, we have been certainly in 2022 playing a bit of catch-up in the costs of senior housing space and just the buildings being less accessible over 2020 and 2021. And then efficient for us a lot of the acquisitions we've made have had substantial value-add opportunities. So we've highlighted that with some of the larger ones and explicitly stated how much kind of redevelopment capital or value-add capital we put into it. But I think that's what's driving that right now is a combination of a little bit of deferred or catch-up capital from a period of time in which the buildings were for safety reasons less accessible. And on top of that, we put a lot of capital to work into opportunities that have high return value-add investment. Yes, yes. And I will -- on the REVPOR side, I think the way to think about it is we talked about this last quarter, but we get a large amount of -- half of our portfolio roughly resets on Jan 1. So you see that occurred -- that part of the portfolio actually happened to also be heavily weighted towards our higher acuity unit types. The Jan 1 increases tend to be the daily billers. The daily billers are the part of the business that have your higher acuity assisted living weighting. So you saw those increases in the first quarter and what you're seeing now kind of spreading from the first quarter to the second quarter is we've talked about in this business, historically, you've seen kind of 10% or high single-digit roll-downs between move-in and move-out rates. A lot of it's acuity related, but that's actually -- that got as wide at 20-plus percent last year and it started to tighten into the mid- to low single-digit range. So you're seeing some of those Jan 1 increases I'd say bleed off a little bit with there is still some negative leasing spreads on that, and that's being offset by annual increases that are hitting throughout pretty much evenly throughout the year and the other half of the portfolio. Yes, correct. They're not in the same-store. So the assets, just to clarify, the assets that we -- in our July business update, that we talked about transitioning. Those are still in the same-store portfolio, they completed the quarter in -- under the management of the prior manager. And then they're coming out going forward. From a sequential basis, we expect a slight drag from a [build] perspective, about 0.5% from those transitions. And Michael, just a continuation to answer to your first question. I think overall, you should certainly hear from us that we've adapted the way that what we've disclosed over the last 2.5 years in a pretty dynamic environment. So a lot of it has been driven certainly by what we think is important. And a lot of this has been driven by feedback from individuals with yourself and investors. So I hope you've seen that and certainly continued to have dialogue with the market on what is helpful to be seen, and we'll continue to adapt what we disclose based upon that. So you shouldn't think there'll be any change in the way that we -- our approach to that."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Q1 2022 Welltower Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce General Counsel, Matt McQueen.\nMatt McQueen: Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance best projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the Company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll describe our capital allocation priorities in the rapidly evolving investment environment and review high-level business trends before handing the call over to John, who will detail operational trends. A little over one year ago, our seniors housing operating business witnessed a powerful inflection point with occupancy gains and pricing power sustained through the remainder of the year despite Delta and Omicron variants. This momentum continued into first quarter of this year and translated into the first period of year-over-year bottom line growth for our company since the beginning of pandemic. Our total portfolio revenue is up 32.7% year-over-year, driven by both organic revenue growth as well as a significant volume of high conviction capital deployment during the last 18 months. On a same-store basis, our Senior Housing Operating portfolio revenue is up 11.2% year-over-year driven by a 4.6% occupancy growth and 4.6% rate growth. Encouragingly, we saw sequential pricing growth was 4.3%, the fastest growth recorded in our history despite only half of our operators pushing through in-house rent increases on Jan 1 schedule. All of these translated into 18.4% same-store NOI growth in Q1, an impressive number that surpassed our expectations. We're all very encouraged by the speed at which free trades are moving up. And we expect same-store NOI growth will accelerate into the second half of the year, barring another COVID spike, all of this setting up to be a powerful earnings recovery that we anticipate in 2023 and beyond. Before I turn into investment environment, I want to make two things here that are very important for multiyear earnings growth path. Number one, in 2018, when we converted our Brandywine Senior Living lease to RIDEA, I mentioned the two other portfolio we had in triple net structure that we hope to convert. One of them was Legend Senior Living. After many years of discussion with Tim McCannon legendary Founder and CEO, I'm pleased to report that we have converted this relationship to RIDEA. Recall that we had an 88% and 20% profit JV between Welltower and Legend. At conversion, Tim contributed a portion of his propco, five brand-new assets and has agreed to a future development agreement to create a powerful 93%, 7% equity partnership going forward. Finally, after years of persuasion, we have convinced him that we can grow the pie using our data analytics platform so significantly that will still be better off this by owning a smaller portion of the pie. A partner of our company since '90s, Legend has paid every single dollar of rent that was owed to Welltower regardless of the coverage on a given day. Though these deals is dilutive to our FFO in 2022 due to significant agency leverages today, we expect cash flow relative to the previous rent will breakeven in beginning of 2023, and our shareholders will enjoy upside from thereon. We hope for extraordinary partnership over last week -- had extraordinary partnership over the last three decades, and we hope that it will continue for many more to come. This transition, along with acquisition and future development partnership exemplifies our sole focus on enhancing long-term value of the portfolio and is indicative of the potential earnings subside in the portfolio that can be captured through a simple cap rate or multiple valuation methodology. Number two, historically, our SHO business focused on managing managers and assets. Now that we have significantly upgraded our operational capabilities, including through the hiring of John Burkart, our COO, our focus in the SHO business will mirror the real estate and management services that we provide in our medical office business or what an apartment rig does with an understanding that we're limited in providing care services in a health -- qualified health care property. This fundamental shift in our approach has a profound impact on how we think about our role in the operating step. This is particularly important as we think through the most important part of that operating platform, which is the technology staff. John will get into the details as part of his script, but we are delighted that he is in full scale development and implementation of a true operating platform at Welltower. John is working closely with some of our best operating partners to launch this, call it RIDEA for now, but honestly, that doesn't do our new approach justice. As to the scale and impact, we think his plans will have on the customer experience and value creation overall. Needless to say, we expect this multiyear initiative will have a tremendous impact on our earnings growth trajectory and long-term compounding machine that we are setting up at Welltower. Now let's talk about capital allocation. As you know, my team is extraordinarily focused on allocating capital to create part share value for existing shareholders. The keyword is existing. We'll favor our existing shareholders who have been our partners to think and thin, especially through thin. We are fiercely protective of their interest on a per share basis, and won't act in a manner that does not create significant value for them. Because we're extremely transparent and genuinely dislike drama, I will mention to you that Welltower is the Party F referenced in theHTA HR merger proxy couple of weeks ago. Every week, we call owners of assets and express our interest to buy them at a price. This was no different. I am genuinely disappointed that HR Board and management did not engage with us, but that is their prerogative. It is completely up to their shareholders and the Board, which presents our shareholders to decide how to maximize value. Because of the many rumors circulating and the reports and articles about this, I'll mention a few things before moving on to much more important items. Number one, we're fair win-win people, we offer to buy the Company on public information at $31.75 per share, plus a breakup fee of $163 million from a which, as you have seen, the market bodes a significantly value destructive for our analyst reports. We believe that our cash offer provided better value to HR shareholders than the HDA merger, and it was fully financed and were prepared to move within days. I read research notes that described our unfair pricing relative to what might be in market cap rate. Please understand that we did not offer to buy an asset, we offer to buy a company that we are willing to pay for assets and pay a breakup fee that company out for company's existing shareholders for potential dilution that will respect and analyst community has been writing about. I hope this will stop mischaracterization of our offer and our intent. Number two, Welltower always has and always will honor its agreement with third parties, including that with HTA. In fact, HTA itself piloted our NDA with them by providing -- by first disclosing it to HR and then later to the public in the joint proxy. Further our NDA with them does not contain a standstill that will apply us to making an offer for HR as a stand-alone entity. As you would expect, we signed it with HTA in order to access information regarding HTA and its properties, therefore, the standstill only applies to HTA and its properties. Our proposal was expressly conditioned on HR not completing their HTA transaction. Number three, we have never chased the deal and never will. We buy everything at a price and sell everything at a price. Although I'm disappointed that HR did not engage with us, as our offer -- we thought our offer would result into a superior outcome for HR shareholders, I have no intention of being hostile. I personally like Todd, I called him and expressed our interest. We didn't buy shares in the public market, nor did we act in anything but a friendly way. They did not engage. Under these circumstances, we have nothing to do here. Number four, contrary to what some analysts might have written, this deal would not have been dilutive to our senior housing growth. You don't know what proportion of equity, debt or joint ventures we might have contemplated for the transaction. But even if you think we were to do this entirely on the balance sheet, it would be a rather simple exercise. Look at the NOI bridge in our business update, divide that NOI by existing number of shares, calculate the additional shares required by the HR transaction to calculate dilution on a part share basis and then add back the accretion from the deal. You will see our existing shareholders would have covered ahead. We look at every single investment through the lens of opportunity costs. Specifically, we have to satisfactorily answer three questions that Buffett has taught us. And then what compared to what at the expense of what. This is not different. And number five, we're not disappointed nor we are concerned about our growth of our senior housing business. While the contrary, in fact, we just reported 18.4% same-store NOI growth and expected to meaningfully accelerate in the second half of the year. Now that I have put all these rumors to let's talk about the 30 or so owners who did engage with us to create win-win partnership transaction. Year-to-date, we have closed $1.2 billion of acquisitions across 21 different off-market or privately negotiated transactions. This is a remarkable stat given the pace of activity last year. I find it difficult to talk about specific deals as it feels like picking your favorite children, but I still mention a handful of transactions to give you a sense. We bought 700 units at our three large communities in Washington State with Cogir to expand our partnership with Matthew and Dave. Dave Eskenazy is one of the best in the business, and I'm glad that he's now back full time at Cogir U.S. as a CEO. We're also expanding our partnership with purchase of another property in Brentwood located in the East Bay of Northern California. All properties were bought at significant discount replacement cost. For example, the Brentwood asset contains large units, and it was bought for $320,000 per unit. We believe the replacement cost in East Bay today is easily significantly north of $500,000 units. Additionally, we are significantly deepening our relationship with Dan and his team at StoryPoint with the acquisition of 33 communities in Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee in their backyard. With a median vintage of 2016, we're extremely pleased with the average price of 197,000 units, which is meaningful discount replacement cost with 63% of current average occupancy this sizable deal will be dilutive to our 2022 FFO per share, but properties are anticipated to generate significant occupancy, margin and cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond on the StoryPoint's enhanced operating platform. This is another example of us choosing the right long-term investment decision and cash flow growth of our GAAP earnings situation, another thing you hear from us consistently. In another transaction, we announced we're expanding our partnership with Courtney and our team at Oakmont with seven new assets in extraordinary locations in California. Courtney and her team are at the absolute top of operating echelons, and we cannot be happier to grow this partnership together. Separately, within the medical office space, we bought four building property portfolio on the campus of one of the strongest hospitals in Birmingham, Alabama for a 5.5% cap rate in an absolute net lease structure at a great basis. Given the absolute debt structure, we expect unlevered IRR to be high single-digit range. We're also under contract to buy two large beautiful MOBs, one in San Francisco Bay Area, another in Sacramento MSA for a high 5% going-in cap rate at a great basis. Again, we expect to generate high single digits in IRR in both cases. In terms of the financing market, in the last 30 days or so, we have seen a massive shift with property level leverage down 15 points, cost doubling and interest only disappearing from the market, both in seniors as well as in MOBs. This is starting to have a tectonic impact on asset pricing. To put bluntly, I have not been this excited about our acquisition prospects since Q4 of 2020. About six weeks ago, an investor, whom I respect very much asked me if I'm optimistic about the next $7 billion of acquisitions, as I was about the last $7 billion of acquisition that we did since pivoting to offense in 4Q of '20. I instinctively answered what I truly believe that we're driven by value, not by volume, which is this investor took it as a no. Today, that answer will be on equivocal yes. Yes, we are excited about the figuratively net $7 billion as we are when we acted on the last $7 billion. To that effect, our pipeline today is roughly $1.5 billion of deals in process across 20 different off-market or privately negotiated transactions. Several of these are potentially operating unit transactions, which we expect to be very popular with the sellers. Please recall that we define our pipeline as transactions that are already under contract. In addition to this, we're negotiating another couple of billion dollars of acquisitions across several other transactions. While we may not eventually succeed in convincing sellers to agree to our price, please note that we don't need any given transaction. Price is the price. We see cracks in the market and are focused on where the puck is going and not where the puck might have been. The value of a party that never titrates and doesn't request debt has really been higher. In more trust systems in nature, such as coastline, cloud, no matter how much you scale up or scale down, you notice a remarkable sale similarity property. You noticed that in same everyone in nature. For example, in Florida cauliflower is same as cauliflower. This phenomenon is called fractal geometry. This is the same idea that our drive time polygons and isochrones are based on if you have seen our data science presentation. Interestingly, organization history is full of company to grow successfully through small bolt-on acquisitions in their advantageous niche only to present themselves on strategic acquisitions that get them in trouble. David Packer, the founder of HP brilliantly said, more businesses die of indigestion than starvation to discuss this phenomenon. At Welltower, we don't have strategic acquisitions. In fact, sales similarity of mother-nature is highly visible in our investment philosophy. No matter how small or big a specific investment is where after the same, driven by the same factors. In all cases, we're buying, number one, a reasonable basis relative to replacement costs; and number two, where we can add value by driving operational improvement. We are not spread investing deal junkies. We have true total retail investors and are optimistic that 2022 will be one of the best years in the Company's history from an acquisition point. With that, I'll hand the call over to my partner, John Burkart, our Chief Operating Officer. John?\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will touch upon the performance of our operating business in the quarter and provide some elements of our vision for senior housing. Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the first quarter, our outpatient medical business delivered 2.7% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, while occupancy declined modestly to 94.5%. We continue to see strong retention rates in the first quarter of 92%, likely driven by rising construction costs, construction delays and the related increases in new lease rents. Going forward, we expect occupancy to decline modestly as we continue to increase renewal rates in line with market increases. Now turning to our senior housing portfolio. The coiled spring, as Shankh has called it, is starting its expansion. Revenue in our same-store portfolio grew at 11. 2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. That's over 2x the growth rate experienced last quarter and the highest year-over-year increase since at least 2017. Our first quarter performance was led by our U.S. portfolio, which reported year-over-year top line growth of 13.5%. Additionally, as we've described in recent calls, pricing power continues to strengthen as reflected by strong renewal rate increases and improving market rate. In fact, RevPAR growth in the first quarter increased by the highest level in years at 4.6% year-over-year and 4.3% sequentially. While expenses grew at a rate of 9.5%, the more insightful expense metric is expense POR or expense per occupied room, which only grew at a rate of 3%, and in the first quarter year-over-year on a year-over-year basis, the lowest since at least 2017. The combination of higher rental rates, increasing occupancy and improving margins led to an outstanding NOI growth rate of 18.4%. Our operators continue to report very strong demand with traffic above 2019 levels, which bodes well for the peak sales season ahead. And if things play out as we expect continued top line strength and further improvement on the expense side should result in a meaningful acceleration in NOI growth in the back half of the year. Understandably, since taking over as COO at Welltower, I've received questions about my vision and areas of focus, both of which I want to provide some insight to on this call. I will outline the opportunity I see and highlight some key elements of my plan, which I believe Welltower is uniquely positioned to execute. As I evaluate the senior housing business, my perspective is a little different than the conventional wisdom that is developed as the health care REIT industry has evolved. The healthcare REIT industry, including Welltower, started with triple net leases for senior housing, giving the owners little to no say in operations and asset management. As the industry evolved with RIDEA, the historic reliance on the operators to run the business continued. The senior housing industry was founded by strong visionary leaders who saw that there was a much better way for society to provide quality lifestyles for its aging members, and they acted accordingly, like so many industries, which are started by small businesses, they are specialists in their core focus, in this case, providing quality living experience for our aging population and generalists and the many other important elements related to running a modern operating business. But as you know, I come to this business with a different perspective and have broken down the business into a few components. It's essentially the multifamily business that provides care with some hospitality. As Shankh alluded to in his opening remarks, although REITs are limited in providing care services, we can perform multifamily type functions like revenue management, capital management, procurement, provide IT expertise as well as leverage our data science expertise. By doing so, we have the opportunity to fundamentally change the potential of this business by creating a full-scale operating platform and bringing operational excellence to the senior housing business. Overall, I have come to believe that Welltower has a substantial opportunity to improve the customer and employee experience and create shareholder value through leading the digital transformation of the business. More to come on timing, but I will say that we are actively working on the initiative, partnering with best-in-class operators, and we will deliver various components as they are ready. The addition of the world-class operating platform will continue to dramatically increase the size and depth of the Welltower moat. And it will greatly simplify the business for our top operators, enabling them to focus on their core strengths increasing their effectiveness and efficiency and driving increased total returns. We expect that all our stakeholders, including our operating partners and investors will emerge as winners in this next phase of the senior housing business. I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\nTim McHugh: Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2022 results. The performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter. Our capital activity our balance sheet liquidity update; and finally, our outlook for the second quarter. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.14 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.82 per diluted share, which was above the midpoint of our $0.79 to $0.84 per share guidance. Despite our results only including approximately $600,000 of HHS funds versus the $6 million expectation we had previously forecasted as part of our guidance. This quarter represented our first with year-over-year normalized FFO growth since the start of the pandemic. And when excluding provider relief funds received in the respective periods, or $0.82 per share represents 15% year-over-year growth versus the first quarter of 2021. We are also pleased to report that total portfolio same-store NOI growth turned positive in the quarter. With 8.9% year-over-year growth, which compares favorably to guidance of 7%. Turning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter years. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2021. In our seniors housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 6.9% year-over-year and exceeded our expectations, driven by improvements in rent collections on leases currently in cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.82x and with a sequential improvement, mainly driven by the conversion of Legend Senior Living today in the quarter. As indicated last quarter, we expect coverages to continue to move higher through the rest of the year as the positive inflection point we started experiencing our SHO portfolio in the first quarter will be reflected in our triple-net coverages on a one-quarter lag. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 1.8% year-over-year same-store NOI growth and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.3x. We completed $6.7 million of long-term post-acute sales in the quarter bringing our total sales in the last 12 months to $525 million and a blending cap rate is 7.5%, with an additional $202 million under contract for sale at quarter end. As a result, our long-term post-acute portfolio represented just 4.8% and of total in-place NOI at year-end versus 10.1% at the end of 2020, a 530 basis point decline driven largely by the exit of our Genesis relationship. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System, had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.02x. As a reminder, this lease is backed by the full corporate guarantee from ProMedica Health System. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the Company to capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to efficiently fund those near-term transactions. Since the start of the year, we have sold 21 million shares via forward sale agreement, an initial weighted average price of approximately $89.9 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.9 billion. We currently have approximately 19.5 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $1.8 billion. Additionally, we are seeing significant interest from potential sellers to accept OP units as consideration, providing further investment capacity. Taken together, our unsettled ATM proceeds, potential OP unit issuances and $352 million of expected property disposition and loan payoff proceeds provide ample capacity to fund our current investment pipeline. During the quarter, we issued our second green bond comprised of $550 million of 10-year unsecured debt maturing in 2032, with a coupon of 3.85%. Following a similar discipline in our equity funding strategy, this is our fourth unsecured issuance since March of 2021, bringing total debt issuance over the span of $2.3 billion with an average duration of 9.5 years and average coupon of 3%. At quarter end, when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. And when combined with the previously mentioned $2.1 billion of unsettled ATM proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we remain in a very strong liquidity position. Lastly, moving to our second quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0. 20 to $0.25 per share, normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.82 to $0.87 per share or $0.845 at the midpoint. This guidance takes into consideration approximately $6 million of HHS funds expected to be received in the second quarter. Guidance represents a $0.025 increase at the midpoint from our $0.82 per share number in 1Q. This $0.025 increase is composed of a $0. 04 sequential increase in our Senior Housing Operating portfolio NOI, $0.01 incremental increase in HHS funds and is offset by $0.025 of increased interest expense, lower foreign exchange rates, particularly the British pound, and dilution from development deliveries. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated in second quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth of 8% to 10%, driven by sub-segment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%; long-term post-acute 2% to 3%; Health System, positive 2.75% and senior housing triple net 7% to 8%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 20%, driven by revenue growth of 11% and underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 500 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and continued robust rate increases. We continue to be pleased by the momentum of the top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by a combination of rate and occupancy growth, setting the stage for a multiyear recovery to average occupancy in the portfolio at 76.4% at quarter end, nearly 1,100 basis points below pre-COVID levels and nearly 1,500 basis points below peak occupancy levels. We've described as recovery in the past as a coiled spring with both secular and cyclical tailwinds behind it. When we started to see the spring release in the core portfolio, we have made the conscious decision to steadily allocate capital to distressed, under-operated and often initially diluted properties, along with high-quality development projects. While this capital allocation has the effect of offsetting some of our core growth today, we will sustainably amplify it in the years to come. In short, we're working hard to keep that spring coil even as we start to realize the power of the earnings growth it can drive. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: I want to sum it up -- sum up the call by saying I cannot be more pleased with the internal and external growth prospects of the Company. We have taken a lot of shots, suffered a lot of pain for the course of many years to finally get to the point where we believe we're primed for long-term compounding. The only way we know how to create significant shareholder wealth over a long period of time. A great investment has three characteristics, outsized returns, low risk and long duration. While we are very successful in finding outsized returns in off-market opportunities that we continue to execute on were equally focused on lower risk and longevity. This is why we're obsessed with acquiring assets at a reasonable basis relative to replacement costs in order to reduce risk. And in terms of longevity, Page 20 of our business update will describe to you 30 or so win-win contractual partnerships that we have signed through a seamless way of trust where we hope to deploy 30-plus billion dollars of capital over the next decade and beyond. We see enormous opportunity for growth within our circle of confidence, which we define as the area where we can allocate capital with households instead of using our predictive analytics platform. This confluence of outsized internal and external growth has created a rare condition, which is called Leaping Emergent Effect or as Munger describes it, Lollapalooza effect. You as our owners can rest assured that we will not make any poor capital allocation decisions that will jeopardize these rare leaping emergent conditions that we have achieved through many years of hard work, luck, courage and a culture where everybody is all in. With that, operator, please open the call up for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: I'm going to try to just want to clarify one. But just first, Shankh, you talked about pricing power or rent growth accelerating. Can you maybe expand on that? What does that mean for the second half and maybe sustainability into '23 on shop pricing power? And then just a clarification, just you talked a lot about the MOB, the HR bid. Just very simplistically, I mean, you've talked -- you've not liked MOBs historically, at least maybe a year or two years ago, like what changed very simplistically.\nShankh Mitra: Okay. Let me answer both of those questions separately. It's not too in. So first, let the answer the MOB question. We like all asset classes at a price. I've always said, even if you look back two quarters ago, we said it makes no sense to us that people buy MOBs in the high 4% cap rate range and after CapEx, you're in the low 4s, when you foresee in the breakeven market, how financing market was going to change, right? I'm just surprised that people are surprised this happened. Now you are in a situation where your financing cost is higher than your cost of -- your return on equity at that kind of pricing, which is a real estate is called Death Cross, right? That is the harbinger of obviously what's to come on the asset pricing side. That just doesn't make any sense to me why would you buy something at those prices with that growth related to inflation. Nothing has changed. Look at Vikram, what we just bought. We bought one MOB at an absolute triple net lease, which obviously means we're not responsible CapEx, call it, 5.5%, which is an equivalent triple net, will be close to a 6%. And we bought two others in California, that's high 5s, right, where we think that we can get to an unlevered high single-digit IRR. So that makes sense to us. So it is all about pricing, not exposure that determines your investment success. Second point, obviously, the pricing power. We're -- obviously, we talked about how we think in-house pricing increase would be, and that's obviously very necessary to offset all the costs that we have seen in the system. I'm particularly encouraged that what we see is street rates are moving. Street rates have moved, I would say, first quarter, we have seen high single digit. In April, we have seen some operators street rates well into double digits, right? So that, along with, if you think about half of our -- roughly speaking, half our residents on not Jan 1 scheduled, right, to receive -- they are on a schedule of anniversary rate. So if you put those two together, we'll see sustained strong pricing power through the year, which we're very, very excited about.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Shankh, I was hoping you could maybe just expound a little bit on the distress that you're seeing in the transaction market. And I realize that you're not necessarily focused on initial cap rates, but I'm curious, when you look at your underwriting, have the unlevered IRRs that you think you're going to achieve change at all? And just trying to get a better flavor for the activity levels and just maybe how return hurdles might be going up for you?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So Steve, if you recall, the initial phases of this pandemic, we have done many transactions in, call it, low single -- low double-digit unlevered IRR, which said as the market started to come back as sort of translated into a high single-digit unlevered IRR, right? And given what happened in the marketplace in the last 30 days, with financing market totally blew up. As I said, leverage is down, cost of leverage is significantly up and IO completely vanished. If you think through that, that's really put a levered IRR model upside down, right? So we are now starting to see -- I've seen more deals dropping from contracts in the last 30 days than I've ever seen in my career. So we are starting to see that all the deals are bouncing back. We always have said that price is a price, we give people a price, underwrite a deal on an unlevered basis. So for us, it doesn't really change anything and we'll t he price. And we're seeing all those things that are coming back. So it is that I don't want to get too excited, but I'm starting to see the emergence of sort of those low double-digit unlevered deals starting to pop up again.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: Just on the agency expenses down 10% sequentially. Can we get a sense of month-by-month improvement especially since Jan and even Feb likely had pretty high Omicron cases seems that agency utilization could have improved each month as we've moved through first quarter. We're just hoping you can quantify the monthly utilization trend and where agency stands today versus expectations?\nShankh Mitra: Derek, we don't want to get into month by month, but you're -- obviously, the way you were thinking about this question is the correct one. We have seen steady improvement through the quarter, and we have seen significant improvement post the quarter, right? So if in or coming in, we have seen that, which is, frankly -- so what sort of gives us confidence that we think where things are continuing in the second quarter as well as in the back half of the year. This is obviously I want to -- I said this -- and I'm going to say this again, we're not in the business of predicting COVID. All bets are off if you have a massive COVID spike again. But that's what we're seeing in normalized market conditions, things are improving rapidly. I don't know, Tim, do you want to add anything to that?\nTim McHugh: No, I think that's right. We gave color on our last call when we do January results we spoke to kind of seeing a 10% decline from December to January. And we gave similar color to and seeing a little better than that as a trend for the full quarter. So I think it gives you a read, we kind of saw consistent decreases relative to the counterpart in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I wanted to ask about the expanded partnership with Oakmont, what's so attractive about the Oakmont partnership? And then maybe could you also touch on the CCRCs that you acquired with them?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So what's most attractive about Oakmont is Oakmont is one of the best operators in the business. I mean -- so we -- I mean, look at -- we have mentioned this before, -- they're one of the first ones to come back to sort of 90-plus percent occupancy range. If you look at Oakmont's portfolio performance, it'll be hard for us to believe for kind performance that there was a pandemic that good in operation. Now going back to the point, what else is very attractive. We disclosed, obviously, I think, a couple of quarters ago, that we signed a long-term partnership development partnership with them. So we're very excited about that. We think we're going to create significant value for Oakmont principles as well as well as Welltower shareholders for us to come. And CCRC, so we did not bring Oakmont to the CCRC, it's a CCRC that Oakmont developed in currently with a lot of -- obviously, this is not just entry-level CCIC. There's also a lot of rental units in there. So, we thought they do an extraordinary job of that. And as we always said, just don't think about these things as this moniker, CCRC, this that, the RIDEA triple doesn't change what fundamentally the business is. These are large campuses. New things that we got at a basis and at a cash flow and see a potential growth of cash flow that we think we can make a lot of money. So that's what we see about the partnership. We also bought four traditional rental model together that we think obviously is going to create meaningful growth as well. A lot of these assets open to 2021. So, you are not going to see probably a very significant amount of earnings contribution in 2022, but you will see potentially significant amount in 2023 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Shankh, I wanted to go back to your comments about no intention of going hostile on HR. Forget HR for a moment, I'd just like to better understand your philosophical views on hospital takeouts broader than HR. So if the price is right, are you interested in going to hospital or do you have philosophically against it?\nShankh Mitra: I'm not going to comment philosophically what I think on hostile and not, frankly speaking, it's an inappropriate for us to do that. I will guarantee you that we will not go hostile. That's not how we do business. We believe that were win-win people, and we like to deal with people who actually -- it just think about it just very simply, reciprocation is how the world works. You walk into an elevator, you smile at a person, 95% of the time that person smiles back at you, that's called mirrored reciprocation. We like to deal with people who believe in mirror reciprocation or we can do win-win transactions with people. We have zero desire to go hostile on HR or anybody.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: So, if I can just kind of use HR as a platform, but think more broadly about how you're thinking about the investment horizon. If your offer price is at a low 5% type implied cap rate on that stock, would you be would it make sense for you to kind of deploy this distressed model here? I don't think there's a whole lot of distress, but relatively speaking, sell the very good stuff, keep the older stuff and feed it redevelopment platform and thereby make your IRR hurdle. Is that kind of the mindset for HR and generally speaking about how you're going to approach almost like a contrarian approach to investing where you are dilutive to start, but much more accretive to end? And specifically to -- are you now only sitting idly by to see how it plays out. No more activity there. And finally, the $163 million break fee, that's not paid to HR, if something were to happen. Is that correct? So that's my one question.\nShankh Mitra: Okay. You asked three questions. I'll see if I remember all of these. So, first is, I will say that we invest, and I think I said this before, and I'm going to say this again, we invest -- and if there are two conditions that get satisfied. One, we think it's at a reasonable basis relative to replacement cost; b, we think we can add significant value on the operational side. These are the two things that needs to come together for us to invest capital in no matter what the specific one is. My view of this hasn't changed. I'm not going to get into buy this, sell that that do this. It just not -- that's not just -- that's not appropriate for a conversation. It just depends on what asset you're talking about, right? So we're not going to obviously get into that. But I will tell you, what I have mentioned in my prepared remarks. At the price, you know for us, we do everything at a price. At the price that we offered we thought HR shareholders will be much better off than going with the HTA merger. That was our opinion, right? And that the price was for the assets as well as releasing them from a potential transaction, which all of you have described as a significantly dilutive deal and market voted as such, right? So you got to think about asset plus liability, not just assets. That is a fundamental mistake of characterization of what's happening here. Regardless, that's not, as I said, that each of our shareholders and their Board, which is representative of the shareholders progress, not ours. So it is very inappropriate for us to keep talking about something, but there's nothing to talk about, right? We're much more focused, as I said, about 30, 40 other owners who are very happily engaging with us to see how we can transact, how can we have a win-win transaction. And I don't have anything more to add to that.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: It's Adam Kramer on for Rich. And congrats on a really strong quarter here, and I appreciate all the commentary. I'll kind of keep this on aside from HR and kind of ask about April occupancy trends within SHO. Anything you can add about kind of sequential trends in April or second quarter to-date, I think, would be really helpful.\nShankh Mitra: We are encouraged by the April as well as early May trends. And we're also encouraged very much where the pricing is going. Remember, John's focus is on revenue maximization and frankly, NOI maximization. But we're very encouraged by both occupancy and rate trends and I'm assuming you're asking a senior housing, so in the senior housing portfolio.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Joseph with Citi.\nMichael Griffin: This is Michael Griffin on for Nick. I'm curious, what do you need to see before being comfortable issuing full year guidance?\nShankh Mitra: We need to be comfortable to see that COVID is not around us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: I wanted to stay on, I guess, or touch on the seniors housing pricing power topic. I mean, how much higher can RevPOR trend RevPOR growth trend, particularly when the occupancy gets back into the high 80s or even the low 90% range. I mean, I'm assuming there's only so high you can push rates on the existing residents, but would this dynamic help push street rates higher and then that could drive RevPOR higher. I mean, how should we think about that?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So Mike, you were asking about my favorite topic, and you are asking me to venture a guess, right? So this is a pure guess and I understand you asked about it. But just start from the position of -- I don't know of any other sector where you can have pricing power in the high 70% kind of occupancy or mid- to high 70% occupancy range, right? So we're very encouraged what's happening. But today, the pricing is driven by the necessity, as I described a couple of calls ago or maybe last call, on the necessity of keeping up with the quality of service, cost of everything is going up, including labor, and we do not believe cutting on services. So that's just sort of the -- what's happening right now; however, there is going to be at a point, not so distant future and probably in the high 80% occupancy rate, where you will be -- you don't -- you wouldn't have rooms to sell. And then you're going to have a different type of pricing increase, right? So that -- these two obviously provide a very, very good backdrop, and if you think through what are the development deliveries, right, that in the next few years are -- a couple of years are. And obviously, it takes a lot of time to bring supply back particularly as you think through what happened, right? The last sort of nail on the coffin for a development project was the financing cost, and that's also now gone completely crazy. So you have costs going up every month for 1.5% to 2%, no one is going to give you a GMP for beyond these days before you lock something in for more than a week. That's kind of a crazy cost environment we are. So in putting it all together, pricing car can sustain for a very long period of time in this kind of demand supply scenario. Now going back to your street rate conversation, I'll just give one example, and one example doesn't obviously is not represented on the whole portfolio. We have seen in April, some of our operators have raised street rates by 15%, while that in-house rate increases 8%, 9%, 10%, right? So we're starting to see for at least for a handful of operators, street rates has already -- increases are going above in-house rate increases. A phenomena we haven't seen, I don't know don't hold me to it. Probably, I don't know, probably 2013, '14 time frame. But so we're pretty excited about it. We think that we have a long runway of pricing increase here. And frankly, as we fundamentally believe that our residents expect a lot from us, they're paying a lot and they expect a lot to reserve a lot and for that, it just costs more today.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Just wanted to go back to the Senior Housing operating segment and how we should think about sequential monthly occupancy gains. I wanted to see if we can get actually the specific number for April. And then also as we think about moving into May through September, third quarter, right. I mean you did make the comment hearing that you expect your year-over-year same-store NOI growth to improve meaningfully in the back half of the year, which would presumably factor in higher sequential occupancy growth than what you're seeing in the second quarter. So just trying to understand about like how we should think about the monthly pace, occupancy gains that could happen, maybe even in relation to last year?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So Nick, if you look at Page 12 of our business update, you will see some sense of how seasonally plays out, right? We have laid that out. Obviously, we expect better than seasonal trends, significantly better than seasonal trends. In the second quarter, but where you see the ship really takes off within the third quarter. So thinking about it without getting into month-to-month, as I have already indicated, the selling season, the summer selling season just started, right? We see very encouraging signs already and we think it will continue to improve as we go forward. Also remember, usually, every year in the Q1 is sort of when you go into -- from Q1 to Q2, going to start at a hole, right, because you lose occupancy. This year, we did not start at a hole, right? We built occupancy where you see occupancy decline. That will have a tremendous impact as you build the revenue line through the rest of the year. Tim, do you want to provide anything else?\nTim McHugh: Yes, I'd just add that from an average occupancy perspective, kind of speaking to that same point John just made, but because 1Q is historically negative, but even in this case, small game, average occupancy, which is kind of build off of the prior quarter and the current quarter recovery will accelerate into 3Q and does so historically. So, when we think about kind of sequential, the drive -- the part of it that's driven by occupancy will be its highest in the third quarter.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt: So sticking with SHO and based on that move in street rates you mentioned were up in the double-digit range. Are you considering pushing rate increases even higher on future renewals through the balance of the year? And then I'm curious if you have a sense how below market your in-place rents are today relative to market? And does this sort of acceleration in fundamentals make you more upbeat about future shop acquisitions and more willing to take on the initial dilution that you talked about in your prepared remarks?\nShankh Mitra: Three questions there, but we will welcome to our call. I will try to remember everything you want. First is, no, it doesn't excite us more or less investing is about price. It's not about exposure. I cannot say this million times enough and if we call for you guys to understand how we allocate capital. It is all about price. We own more senior housing than anyone. We bought more senior housing than anyone even the last 18 months. So senior housing is going to do significantly better. There has been no other beneficiary more beneficiary than us, right? So having said that, you think about the point, I also want to make sure you hear me. I said for a specific operator, I don't want you to think street rates are going up 15%, right? So everywhere, that's not what's happening. But we see broad momentum of increasing street rate pretty much everywhere with every operator, okay? So let's just put that in the context of understanding how senior housing works. Remember, you have an acuity creep as people age in place or age in a community, okay? So you will always have the portion who is living versus the person who is coming in, there's a gap, right? There's a gap because of that to decrease, the frailty and the acuity creep. What we are seeing, this rapidly rising street rate is closing that gap pretty meaningfully. And we hope that we'll see at some point that gap is going to come together. But at the same point, I understand, as we sort of get to the next year, right, there's going to be significant in-house rate increases again. So, you create another gap and you chase that gap again, right? That's how you build revenue. So, we're pretty optimistic. Generally speaking, the tone of your question is the right one, which excites us very much this moving, obviously, rates that we are starting to see, we'll see that will be sustained, all things being equal through the year and will show up in our top line growth as well as the NOI growth that Tim and John talked about.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller: Just a quick expense question. It looks like your same-store SHO compensation has been running about 3.25 for the past two quarters. Can you remind us what portion of that would you say is abnormally high because of COVID and agency costs, where we could see that portion of it decline in the subsequent quarters?\nTim McHugh: Yes. So we peaked out at a little over 7% or 7.5% of our compensation line was agency in the fourth quarter. That came down to high 6x and we continue to expect that to normalize throughout the year. But just thinking about that from -- I think that's what you're asking, Mike, is just kind of what portion of that is agency. We expect that agency to continue to deflate. But remember, that gets backfilled by full-time hours. So it's not -- there will be some offset of that from full-time employees coming on. I'll just note that, that's something that we're certainly seeing progress on coming out of the first quarter and in April is that the focus our operators have put on hiring full-time employees and we all know that's the solution to agency. That's why we're seeing progress on the agency front because occupancy continues to build. So we're not seeing less of a demand for employees in the buildings. We're just seeing an ability to fill it more and more with our own staff versus agency.\nShankh Mitra: In fact, April probably was the best month we have seen from a net hiring perspective since we've started tracking this from the beginning of COVID. So you haven't seen the impact that we're talking about, you'll see that obviously in Q2 on a sequential basis, but again, I'm not going to comment on COVID. I have no way to predict what COVID is happening, not happening, going. But in a normalized market conditions, you will see that will improvement and will significantly expect the second half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just hoping, if we could touch a little bit on the triple net business, you mentioned the Legend transition and a little bit of dilution there. But just holistically speaking, how should we think about the potential for further transitions, I guess, to shop at this point? And how same-store NOI should track towards the historical 2% to 3% given you're still kind of below the target rent coverage? And kind of what you expect that timing to be to get coverage back to a more sustainable level for those to kind of normalize the same-store growth in the coverage level?\nShankh Mitra: One thing about me that you probably have noticed over the years, we know each other that I'm extremely consistent. In 2018, I said there are two portfolios that I hope that we had in the RIDEA portfolio. In 2022, I'll tell you the same thing. And maybe if I couldn't convince the last one, I'll keep saying the same thing for years to come. So you should not expect a lot to change unless we believe, there is fundamentally economic reasons to change from RIDEA to triple net. Fundamentally, we believe it's the same business, different structures for different reasons, different growth profile. So I've gone through this in the call before, so I don't want to waste your time. But that just -- you should not expect a lot more except that one that I have hoped for, for many, many years. So let's just now take the second part of your question. So where you are today, Tim talked about it probably three, four calls in a row now, that we have a significant portion of our triple and portfolio in cash collection, right? And he mentioned when the growth comes back, you will see the other side of it. We have taken it on our chin, right, by putting in cash collection. And now we're on the other side. So obviously, that line item for these operators are behaving like RIDEA, right, because that's what they are. They are cash collection. So on top of that, we have a substantial number of leases that are marked to inflation. And as inflation is going up, so you have overall portfolio is going up. So, that probably -- these two together, probably 35%, 40% of the triple-net portfolio, and that's why you are seeing, obviously, that's why not only you are seeing, we continue to see significant sort of above average growth as long as we have average inflation that sort of in the system. Tim, do you want to add anything to that?\nTim McHugh: No, I'll just add, Juan, on your comment on coverages. So -- and restructuring -- so Shankh mentioned, we restructured a Legend lease in the quarter. We also restructured another triple-net lease in the quarter. And I would think about it from the timing makes sense given what we've talked about in the past, which is our operators were staying current with rent and resetting rents when they're staying current, and there's no line of sight and recovery doesn't make sense for other party. So I think what you've seen here is an ability to come to the table on Legend to get to an agreement that makes sense for both parties, and we think we'll do very well for Welltower shareholders over time. But as you look at the Welltower triple-net portfolio coming out of the first quarter, we're at mid-80s coverage on a portfolio that's 70%, 70.5% occupied. So, I think -- the important thing about the sustainability of that, I think, is quite high, given our view on the recovery. We said it all along. It's all recovery dependent, but we saw a strong recovery last year. We've seen rents continue to be paid. And we think given the occupancy there and the outlook in general in the space and where coverages are currently at, we're a pretty strong spot as far as sustainability of these rents and coverage recovery over the coming quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: So, Shankh, all your comments on the HR situation were obviously helpful to clear the air. I guess my question is if the HR HTA merger does close and actually goes through is the existence of that merged entity changed any of the strategic dynamics for Welltower in the MOB category, that is the positive or the negative that are worth calling out at this stage? Or is that merger really is just expected to be immaterial to either MOB industry pricing going forward or just perhaps immaterial to what Welltower is trying to accomplish in the MOB area based on what you see now?\nShankh Mitra: Steve, I have no comments on HR HTA merger. I will say that it remains a fragmented industry that one player size or lag thereof doesn't really make a difference. It's a health system driven industry and remains a very, very fragmented industry. So I have no comments other than the fact we don't see anything changing. But I will offer a comment that I already have offered and bore you with details of what I've already said. At Welltower, we don't have a strategic acquisition. The only strategy that we have is to make money on a per share basis for existing shareholders. That is the only strategy we follow. And anything that doesn't fit to that model, we don't do it, right? So please understand, never count on us to do a strategic acquisition because we'll never will.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: I just wanted to have one follow-up. Tim, when you kind of looked at the second quarter guidance, obviously, NOI growth is kind of above FFO growth. And I know you kind of highlighted a couple of issues that seem to be pulling that down FX, G&A and development deliveries. I guess my question really is, as you move into the back half of the year and maybe into '23, do you see some of those headwinds dissipating? And should we start to see growth materially accelerate in line with NOI growth? Or does some of those headwinds persist for a bit longer?\nTim McHugh: Yes. Thanks, Steve. And I think this is -- this will expand a bit on the comment in my opening remarks around just our continued steady allocation of capital to distressed situations, near-term dilutive, even developments, the idea that we're seeing core earnings growth that's really driving the portfolio now. And we're making long-term capital allocation decisions that are going to create sustainable growth over a multiyear period. And if I kind of take that in think about it in perspective of this quarter, and talked about same-store NOI growth on a year-over-year basis. So you go back to the second quarter of 2021, on the call, I spoke to a $0.77 per share number, if you back out out-of-period government grants. So this compares to $0.835 number ex HHS with our 2Q guide. And I think the right way to think about bridging this is kind of three different buckets. So you've got the core portfolio, which is to your comment on same-store driven by same-store growth, 9% cash same-store growth equates to about lever 10% FFO growth number. Then you've got accretion from investments over kind of the last three quarters, you've got an offset of $0.03 from a combination of higher interest expense, higher G&A and then lower exchange rates on a year-over-year basis. So if you dig in that investment accretion number a bit more, over the last three quarters, we have invested about $4.8 billion in capital. We've delivered another $500 million in developments. So we've got $5.3 billion of capital fully funded on the balance sheet as of 3/31 and it's expected to yield in the low 4s in that guide. So keep in mind that these assets are significantly under earning where they're going to be long term and near term, it's because of operator transitions and lease-up within our recent deliveries. And of course, agency has also been a factor there. As these investments stabilize, they represent about $0.10 per share of FFO per quarter or $0.40 annually. So just from the last kind of three quarters of capital allocation. And lastly, I'd just note, we've talked about our NOI bridge in our investor presentation and this is under 1/3 of that upside represented there. So it's kind of a snapshot within our year-over-year growth, showing how the capital we're putting to work is just creating the sustained earnings growth over a number of years going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Thanks for the follow-up. I had some technical difficulties, so hopefully not repeating a question. But in terms of the use of OP units, obviously, your distressed model would imply older assets and hence, the attractiveness of units in a deal. How would you model out funding one point what do you say, the pipeline is $1.5 billion pipeline, plus another $2 billion that is under -- in the works. What percentage of that would be OP-unit deals? And then how would you time line the remaining forward ATM equity just so we can get our models in the right order.\nShankh Mitra: Okay. I will -- I hope I remember all the questions. First, we're not going to get into how many of these transactions will be in OP units or not. We might have given some indication of our previous press releases on some of the transactions. But beyond that, we're not going to get into how many will be or will not be. We have a general sense, but we're not going to get into that. But let's just talk about something else that you asked, which is if you think about the pipeline of $1.5 billion under contract, right? Think about what Tim said, the $1.8 billion of capital that's raised in the ATM, but not settled. We have a few hundred million dollars of disposition, and that's just the equity piece, right? You add X million that you think will come from the OP side, and then on a 65-35, you will see our investment sort of dry power for investment is actually $3-plus billion today, right? So that's sort of the question. And is there anything else I did not answer. I can't remember three questions at the same time, Rich. But -- so I think I answered all your questions, if not just call me on my cell and we'll just walk you through. But we have ample capacity to invest capital that in the pipeline or could be in the shadow pipeline. Pipeline costs to deals under contract. Shadow pipeline is what we are negotiating. And as I said, off that $2-plus billion, we might do zero because we transact at our price and the price is the price. And if we can convince someone to come to our price, we will do that transaction. So very much of we have the capital raised, but I cannot guarantee you that we apply to any of these transactions.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Just one modeling related item for me. Could you give me a sense, Tim, what percent of food and utility costs are ultimately passed through to the tenant on the SHO portfolio?\nTim McHugh: You think about a pass-through, I guess, you mean from like a direct billing?\nJohn Pawlowski: The higher rents, higher rents and higher fee income.\nTim McHugh: I'd say, all of it, we have an operating profit in that business. So you're making a profit on 1 basis. You're certainly seeing part of the rationale for rent increase being to offset inflationary pressures in both those categories. But those aren't things -- food is something -- you're certainly in a lot of these different contracts you're highlighting as being a separate cost. Utilities generally not, but that's all wrapped into how pricing for the product works. So, I think when we talk about kind of seeing inflationary plus type rental increases. We're talking about the ability to offset the pressure we're seeing in food and utility inflation.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will touch upon the performance of our operating business in the quarter and provide some elements of our vision for senior housing. Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the first quarter, our outpatient medical business delivered 2.7% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, while occupancy declined modestly to 94.5%. We continue to see strong retention rates in the first quarter of 92%, likely driven by rising construction costs, construction delays and the related increases in new lease rents. Going forward, we expect occupancy to decline modestly as we continue to increase renewal rates in line with market increases. Now turning to our senior housing portfolio. The coiled spring, as Shankh has called it, is starting its expansion. Revenue in our same-store portfolio grew at 11. 2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. That's over 2x the growth rate experienced last quarter and the highest year-over-year increase since at least 2017. Our first quarter performance was led by our U.S. portfolio, which reported year-over-year top line growth of 13.5%. Additionally, as we've described in recent calls, pricing power continues to strengthen as reflected by strong renewal rate increases and improving market rate. In fact, RevPAR growth in the first quarter increased by the highest level in years at 4.6% year-over-year and 4.3% sequentially. While expenses grew at a rate of 9.5%, the more insightful expense metric is expense POR or expense per occupied room, which only grew at a rate of 3%, and in the first quarter year-over-year on a year-over-year basis, the lowest since at least 2017. The combination of higher rental rates, increasing occupancy and improving margins led to an outstanding NOI growth rate of 18.4%. Our operators continue to report very strong demand with traffic above 2019 levels, which bodes well for the peak sales season ahead. And if things play out as we expect continued top line strength and further improvement on the expense side should result in a meaningful acceleration in NOI growth in the back half of the year. Understandably, since taking over as COO at Welltower, I've received questions about my vision and areas of focus, both of which I want to provide some insight to on this call. I will outline the opportunity I see and highlight some key elements of my plan, which I believe Welltower is uniquely positioned to execute. As I evaluate the senior housing business, my perspective is a little different than the conventional wisdom that is developed as the health care REIT industry has evolved. The healthcare REIT industry, including Welltower, started with triple net leases for senior housing, giving the owners little to no say in operations and asset management. As the industry evolved with RIDEA, the historic reliance on the operators to run the business continued. The senior housing industry was founded by strong visionary leaders who saw that there was a much better way for society to provide quality lifestyles for its aging members, and they acted accordingly, like so many industries, which are started by small businesses, they are specialists in their core focus, in this case, providing quality living experience for our aging population and generalists and the many other important elements related to running a modern operating business. But as you know, I come to this business with a different perspective and have broken down the business into a few components. It's essentially the multifamily business that provides care with some hospitality. As Shankh alluded to in his opening remarks, although REITs are limited in providing care services, we can perform multifamily type functions like revenue management, capital management, procurement, provide IT expertise as well as leverage our data science expertise. By doing so, we have the opportunity to fundamentally change the potential of this business by creating a full-scale operating platform and bringing operational excellence to the senior housing business. Overall, I have come to believe that Welltower has a substantial opportunity to improve the customer and employee experience and create shareholder value through leading the digital transformation of the business. More to come on timing, but I will say that we are actively working on the initiative, partnering with best-in-class operators, and we will deliver various components as they are ready. The addition of the world-class operating platform will continue to dramatically increase the size and depth of the Welltower moat. And it will greatly simplify the business for our top operators, enabling them to focus on their core strengths increasing their effectiveness and efficiency and driving increased total returns. We expect that all our stakeholders, including our operating partners and investors will emerge as winners in this next phase of the senior housing business. I'll now turn the call over to Tim."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll describe our capital allocation priorities in the rapidly evolving investment environment and review high-level business trends before handing the call over to John, who will detail operational trends. A little over one year ago, our seniors housing operating business witnessed a powerful inflection point with occupancy gains and pricing power sustained through the remainder of the year despite Delta and Omicron variants. This momentum continued into first quarter of this year and translated into the first period of year-over-year bottom line growth for our company since the beginning of pandemic. Our total portfolio revenue is up 32.7% year-over-year, driven by both organic revenue growth as well as a significant volume of high conviction capital deployment during the last 18 months. On a same-store basis, our Senior Housing Operating portfolio revenue is up 11.2% year-over-year driven by a 4.6% occupancy growth and 4.6% rate growth. Encouragingly, we saw sequential pricing growth was 4.3%, the fastest growth recorded in our history despite only half of our operators pushing through in-house rent increases on Jan 1 schedule. All of these translated into 18.4% same-store NOI growth in Q1, an impressive number that surpassed our expectations. We're all very encouraged by the speed at which free trades are moving up. And we expect same-store NOI growth will accelerate into the second half of the year, barring another COVID spike, all of this setting up to be a powerful earnings recovery that we anticipate in 2023 and beyond. Before I turn into investment environment, I want to make two things here that are very important for multiyear earnings growth path. Number one, in 2018, when we converted our Brandywine Senior Living lease to RIDEA, I mentioned the two other portfolio we had in triple net structure that we hope to convert. One of them was Legend Senior Living. After many years of discussion with Tim McCannon legendary Founder and CEO, I'm pleased to report that we have converted this relationship to RIDEA. Recall that we had an 88% and 20% profit JV between Welltower and Legend. At conversion, Tim contributed a portion of his propco, five brand-new assets and has agreed to a future development agreement to create a powerful 93%, 7% equity partnership going forward. Finally, after years of persuasion, we have convinced him that we can grow the pie using our data analytics platform so significantly that will still be better off this by owning a smaller portion of the pie. A partner of our company since '90s, Legend has paid every single dollar of rent that was owed to Welltower regardless of the coverage on a given day. Though these deals is dilutive to our FFO in 2022 due to significant agency leverages today, we expect cash flow relative to the previous rent will breakeven in beginning of 2023, and our shareholders will enjoy upside from thereon. We hope for extraordinary partnership over last week -- had extraordinary partnership over the last three decades, and we hope that it will continue for many more to come. This transition, along with acquisition and future development partnership exemplifies our sole focus on enhancing long-term value of the portfolio and is indicative of the potential earnings subside in the portfolio that can be captured through a simple cap rate or multiple valuation methodology. Number two, historically, our SHO business focused on managing managers and assets. Now that we have significantly upgraded our operational capabilities, including through the hiring of John Burkart, our COO, our focus in the SHO business will mirror the real estate and management services that we provide in our medical office business or what an apartment rig does with an understanding that we're limited in providing care services in a health -- qualified health care property. This fundamental shift in our approach has a profound impact on how we think about our role in the operating step. This is particularly important as we think through the most important part of that operating platform, which is the technology staff. John will get into the details as part of his script, but we are delighted that he is in full scale development and implementation of a true operating platform at Welltower. John is working closely with some of our best operating partners to launch this, call it RIDEA for now, but honestly, that doesn't do our new approach justice. As to the scale and impact, we think his plans will have on the customer experience and value creation overall. Needless to say, we expect this multiyear initiative will have a tremendous impact on our earnings growth trajectory and long-term compounding machine that we are setting up at Welltower. Now let's talk about capital allocation. As you know, my team is extraordinarily focused on allocating capital to create part share value for existing shareholders. The keyword is existing. We'll favor our existing shareholders who have been our partners to think and thin, especially through thin. We are fiercely protective of their interest on a per share basis, and won't act in a manner that does not create significant value for them. Because we're extremely transparent and genuinely dislike drama, I will mention to you that Welltower is the Party F referenced in theHTA HR merger proxy couple of weeks ago. Every week, we call owners of assets and express our interest to buy them at a price. This was no different. I am genuinely disappointed that HR Board and management did not engage with us, but that is their prerogative. It is completely up to their shareholders and the Board, which presents our shareholders to decide how to maximize value. Because of the many rumors circulating and the reports and articles about this, I'll mention a few things before moving on to much more important items. Number one, we're fair win-win people, we offer to buy the Company on public information at $31.75 per share, plus a breakup fee of $163 million from a which, as you have seen, the market bodes a significantly value destructive for our analyst reports. We believe that our cash offer provided better value to HR shareholders than the HDA merger, and it was fully financed and were prepared to move within days. I read research notes that described our unfair pricing relative to what might be in market cap rate. Please understand that we did not offer to buy an asset, we offer to buy a company that we are willing to pay for assets and pay a breakup fee that company out for company's existing shareholders for potential dilution that will respect and analyst community has been writing about. I hope this will stop mischaracterization of our offer and our intent. Number two, Welltower always has and always will honor its agreement with third parties, including that with HTA. In fact, HTA itself piloted our NDA with them by providing -- by first disclosing it to HR and then later to the public in the joint proxy. Further our NDA with them does not contain a standstill that will apply us to making an offer for HR as a stand-alone entity. As you would expect, we signed it with HTA in order to access information regarding HTA and its properties, therefore, the standstill only applies to HTA and its properties. Our proposal was expressly conditioned on HR not completing their HTA transaction. Number three, we have never chased the deal and never will. We buy everything at a price and sell everything at a price. Although I'm disappointed that HR did not engage with us, as our offer -- we thought our offer would result into a superior outcome for HR shareholders, I have no intention of being hostile. I personally like Todd, I called him and expressed our interest. We didn't buy shares in the public market, nor did we act in anything but a friendly way. They did not engage. Under these circumstances, we have nothing to do here. Number four, contrary to what some analysts might have written, this deal would not have been dilutive to our senior housing growth. You don't know what proportion of equity, debt or joint ventures we might have contemplated for the transaction. But even if you think we were to do this entirely on the balance sheet, it would be a rather simple exercise. Look at the NOI bridge in our business update, divide that NOI by existing number of shares, calculate the additional shares required by the HR transaction to calculate dilution on a part share basis and then add back the accretion from the deal. You will see our existing shareholders would have covered ahead. We look at every single investment through the lens of opportunity costs. Specifically, we have to satisfactorily answer three questions that Buffett has taught us. And then what compared to what at the expense of what. This is not different. And number five, we're not disappointed nor we are concerned about our growth of our senior housing business. While the contrary, in fact, we just reported 18.4% same-store NOI growth and expected to meaningfully accelerate in the second half of the year. Now that I have put all these rumors to let's talk about the 30 or so owners who did engage with us to create win-win partnership transaction. Year-to-date, we have closed $1.2 billion of acquisitions across 21 different off-market or privately negotiated transactions. This is a remarkable stat given the pace of activity last year. I find it difficult to talk about specific deals as it feels like picking your favorite children, but I still mention a handful of transactions to give you a sense. We bought 700 units at our three large communities in Washington State with Cogir to expand our partnership with Matthew and Dave. Dave Eskenazy is one of the best in the business, and I'm glad that he's now back full time at Cogir U.S. as a CEO. We're also expanding our partnership with purchase of another property in Brentwood located in the East Bay of Northern California. All properties were bought at significant discount replacement cost. For example, the Brentwood asset contains large units, and it was bought for $320,000 per unit. We believe the replacement cost in East Bay today is easily significantly north of $500,000 units. Additionally, we are significantly deepening our relationship with Dan and his team at StoryPoint with the acquisition of 33 communities in Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee in their backyard. With a median vintage of 2016, we're extremely pleased with the average price of 197,000 units, which is meaningful discount replacement cost with 63% of current average occupancy this sizable deal will be dilutive to our 2022 FFO per share, but properties are anticipated to generate significant occupancy, margin and cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond on the StoryPoint's enhanced operating platform. This is another example of us choosing the right long-term investment decision and cash flow growth of our GAAP earnings situation, another thing you hear from us consistently. In another transaction, we announced we're expanding our partnership with Courtney and our team at Oakmont with seven new assets in extraordinary locations in California. Courtney and her team are at the absolute top of operating echelons, and we cannot be happier to grow this partnership together. Separately, within the medical office space, we bought four building property portfolio on the campus of one of the strongest hospitals in Birmingham, Alabama for a 5.5% cap rate in an absolute net lease structure at a great basis. Given the absolute debt structure, we expect unlevered IRR to be high single-digit range. We're also under contract to buy two large beautiful MOBs, one in San Francisco Bay Area, another in Sacramento MSA for a high 5% going-in cap rate at a great basis. Again, we expect to generate high single digits in IRR in both cases. In terms of the financing market, in the last 30 days or so, we have seen a massive shift with property level leverage down 15 points, cost doubling and interest only disappearing from the market, both in seniors as well as in MOBs. This is starting to have a tectonic impact on asset pricing. To put bluntly, I have not been this excited about our acquisition prospects since Q4 of 2020. About six weeks ago, an investor, whom I respect very much asked me if I'm optimistic about the next $7 billion of acquisitions, as I was about the last $7 billion of acquisition that we did since pivoting to offense in 4Q of '20. I instinctively answered what I truly believe that we're driven by value, not by volume, which is this investor took it as a no. Today, that answer will be on equivocal yes. Yes, we are excited about the figuratively net $7 billion as we are when we acted on the last $7 billion. To that effect, our pipeline today is roughly $1.5 billion of deals in process across 20 different off-market or privately negotiated transactions. Several of these are potentially operating unit transactions, which we expect to be very popular with the sellers. Please recall that we define our pipeline as transactions that are already under contract. In addition to this, we're negotiating another couple of billion dollars of acquisitions across several other transactions. While we may not eventually succeed in convincing sellers to agree to our price, please note that we don't need any given transaction. Price is the price. We see cracks in the market and are focused on where the puck is going and not where the puck might have been. The value of a party that never titrates and doesn't request debt has really been higher. In more trust systems in nature, such as coastline, cloud, no matter how much you scale up or scale down, you notice a remarkable sale similarity property. You noticed that in same everyone in nature. For example, in Florida cauliflower is same as cauliflower. This phenomenon is called fractal geometry. This is the same idea that our drive time polygons and isochrones are based on if you have seen our data science presentation. Interestingly, organization history is full of company to grow successfully through small bolt-on acquisitions in their advantageous niche only to present themselves on strategic acquisitions that get them in trouble. David Packer, the founder of HP brilliantly said, more businesses die of indigestion than starvation to discuss this phenomenon. At Welltower, we don't have strategic acquisitions. In fact, sales similarity of mother-nature is highly visible in our investment philosophy. No matter how small or big a specific investment is where after the same, driven by the same factors. In all cases, we're buying, number one, a reasonable basis relative to replacement costs; and number two, where we can add value by driving operational improvement. We are not spread investing deal junkies. We have true total retail investors and are optimistic that 2022 will be one of the best years in the Company's history from an acquisition point. With that, I'll hand the call over to my partner, John Burkart, our Chief Operating Officer. John? I want to sum it up -- sum up the call by saying I cannot be more pleased with the internal and external growth prospects of the Company. We have taken a lot of shots, suffered a lot of pain for the course of many years to finally get to the point where we believe we're primed for long-term compounding. The only way we know how to create significant shareholder wealth over a long period of time. A great investment has three characteristics, outsized returns, low risk and long duration. While we are very successful in finding outsized returns in off-market opportunities that we continue to execute on were equally focused on lower risk and longevity. This is why we're obsessed with acquiring assets at a reasonable basis relative to replacement costs in order to reduce risk. And in terms of longevity, Page 20 of our business update will describe to you 30 or so win-win contractual partnerships that we have signed through a seamless way of trust where we hope to deploy 30-plus billion dollars of capital over the next decade and beyond. We see enormous opportunity for growth within our circle of confidence, which we define as the area where we can allocate capital with households instead of using our predictive analytics platform. This confluence of outsized internal and external growth has created a rare condition, which is called Leaping Emergent Effect or as Munger describes it, Lollapalooza effect. You as our owners can rest assured that we will not make any poor capital allocation decisions that will jeopardize these rare leaping emergent conditions that we have achieved through many years of hard work, luck, courage and a culture where everybody is all in. With that, operator, please open the call up for questions. Thank you. Okay. Let me answer both of those questions separately. It's not too in. So first, let the answer the MOB question. We like all asset classes at a price. I've always said, even if you look back two quarters ago, we said it makes no sense to us that people buy MOBs in the high 4% cap rate range and after CapEx, you're in the low 4s, when you foresee in the breakeven market, how financing market was going to change, right? I'm just surprised that people are surprised this happened. Now you are in a situation where your financing cost is higher than your cost of -- your return on equity at that kind of pricing, which is a real estate is called Death Cross, right? That is the harbinger of obviously what's to come on the asset pricing side. That just doesn't make any sense to me why would you buy something at those prices with that growth related to inflation. Nothing has changed. Look at Vikram, what we just bought. We bought one MOB at an absolute triple net lease, which obviously means we're not responsible CapEx, call it, 5.5%, which is an equivalent triple net, will be close to a 6%. And we bought two others in California, that's high 5s, right, where we think that we can get to an unlevered high single-digit IRR. So that makes sense to us. So it is all about pricing, not exposure that determines your investment success. Second point, obviously, the pricing power. We're -- obviously, we talked about how we think in-house pricing increase would be, and that's obviously very necessary to offset all the costs that we have seen in the system. I'm particularly encouraged that what we see is street rates are moving. Street rates have moved, I would say, first quarter, we have seen high single digit. In April, we have seen some operators street rates well into double digits, right? So that, along with, if you think about half of our -- roughly speaking, half our residents on not Jan 1 scheduled, right, to receive -- they are on a schedule of anniversary rate. So if you put those two together, we'll see sustained strong pricing power through the year, which we're very, very excited about. Yes. So Steve, if you recall, the initial phases of this pandemic, we have done many transactions in, call it, low single -- low double-digit unlevered IRR, which said as the market started to come back as sort of translated into a high single-digit unlevered IRR, right? And given what happened in the marketplace in the last 30 days, with financing market totally blew up. As I said, leverage is down, cost of leverage is significantly up and IO completely vanished. If you think through that, that's really put a levered IRR model upside down, right? So we are now starting to see -- I've seen more deals dropping from contracts in the last 30 days than I've ever seen in my career. So we are starting to see that all the deals are bouncing back. We always have said that price is a price, we give people a price, underwrite a deal on an unlevered basis. So for us, it doesn't really change anything and we'll t he price. And we're seeing all those things that are coming back. So it is that I don't want to get too excited, but I'm starting to see the emergence of sort of those low double-digit unlevered deals starting to pop up again. Derek, we don't want to get into month by month, but you're -- obviously, the way you were thinking about this question is the correct one. We have seen steady improvement through the quarter, and we have seen significant improvement post the quarter, right? So if in or coming in, we have seen that, which is, frankly -- so what sort of gives us confidence that we think where things are continuing in the second quarter as well as in the back half of the year. This is obviously I want to -- I said this -- and I'm going to say this again, we're not in the business of predicting COVID. All bets are off if you have a massive COVID spike again. But that's what we're seeing in normalized market conditions, things are improving rapidly. I don't know, Tim, do you want to add anything to that? Yes. So what's most attractive about Oakmont is Oakmont is one of the best operators in the business. I mean -- so we -- I mean, look at -- we have mentioned this before, -- they're one of the first ones to come back to sort of 90-plus percent occupancy range. If you look at Oakmont's portfolio performance, it'll be hard for us to believe for kind performance that there was a pandemic that good in operation. Now going back to the point, what else is very attractive. We disclosed, obviously, I think, a couple of quarters ago, that we signed a long-term partnership development partnership with them. So we're very excited about that. We think we're going to create significant value for Oakmont principles as well as well as Welltower shareholders for us to come. And CCRC, so we did not bring Oakmont to the CCRC, it's a CCRC that Oakmont developed in currently with a lot of -- obviously, this is not just entry-level CCIC. There's also a lot of rental units in there. So, we thought they do an extraordinary job of that. And as we always said, just don't think about these things as this moniker, CCRC, this that, the RIDEA triple doesn't change what fundamentally the business is. These are large campuses. New things that we got at a basis and at a cash flow and see a potential growth of cash flow that we think we can make a lot of money. So that's what we see about the partnership. We also bought four traditional rental model together that we think obviously is going to create meaningful growth as well. A lot of these assets open to 2021. So, you are not going to see probably a very significant amount of earnings contribution in 2022, but you will see potentially significant amount in 2023 and beyond. I'm not going to comment philosophically what I think on hostile and not, frankly speaking, it's an inappropriate for us to do that. I will guarantee you that we will not go hostile. That's not how we do business. We believe that were win-win people, and we like to deal with people who actually -- it just think about it just very simply, reciprocation is how the world works. You walk into an elevator, you smile at a person, 95% of the time that person smiles back at you, that's called mirrored reciprocation. We like to deal with people who believe in mirror reciprocation or we can do win-win transactions with people. We have zero desire to go hostile on HR or anybody. Okay. You asked three questions. I'll see if I remember all of these. So, first is, I will say that we invest, and I think I said this before, and I'm going to say this again, we invest -- and if there are two conditions that get satisfied. One, we think it's at a reasonable basis relative to replacement cost; b, we think we can add significant value on the operational side. These are the two things that needs to come together for us to invest capital in no matter what the specific one is. My view of this hasn't changed. I'm not going to get into buy this, sell that that do this. It just not -- that's not just -- that's not appropriate for a conversation. It just depends on what asset you're talking about, right? So we're not going to obviously get into that. But I will tell you, what I have mentioned in my prepared remarks. At the price, you know for us, we do everything at a price. At the price that we offered we thought HR shareholders will be much better off than going with the HTA merger. That was our opinion, right? And that the price was for the assets as well as releasing them from a potential transaction, which all of you have described as a significantly dilutive deal and market voted as such, right? So you got to think about asset plus liability, not just assets. That is a fundamental mistake of characterization of what's happening here. Regardless, that's not, as I said, that each of our shareholders and their Board, which is representative of the shareholders progress, not ours. So it is very inappropriate for us to keep talking about something, but there's nothing to talk about, right? We're much more focused, as I said, about 30, 40 other owners who are very happily engaging with us to see how we can transact, how can we have a win-win transaction. And I don't have anything more to add to that. We are encouraged by the April as well as early May trends. And we're also encouraged very much where the pricing is going. Remember, John's focus is on revenue maximization and frankly, NOI maximization. But we're very encouraged by both occupancy and rate trends and I'm assuming you're asking a senior housing, so in the senior housing portfolio. We need to be comfortable to see that COVID is not around us. Yes. So Mike, you were asking about my favorite topic, and you are asking me to venture a guess, right? So this is a pure guess and I understand you asked about it. But just start from the position of -- I don't know of any other sector where you can have pricing power in the high 70% kind of occupancy or mid- to high 70% occupancy range, right? So we're very encouraged what's happening. But today, the pricing is driven by the necessity, as I described a couple of calls ago or maybe last call, on the necessity of keeping up with the quality of service, cost of everything is going up, including labor, and we do not believe cutting on services. So that's just sort of the -- what's happening right now; however, there is going to be at a point, not so distant future and probably in the high 80% occupancy rate, where you will be -- you don't -- you wouldn't have rooms to sell. And then you're going to have a different type of pricing increase, right? So that -- these two obviously provide a very, very good backdrop, and if you think through what are the development deliveries, right, that in the next few years are -- a couple of years are. And obviously, it takes a lot of time to bring supply back particularly as you think through what happened, right? The last sort of nail on the coffin for a development project was the financing cost, and that's also now gone completely crazy. So you have costs going up every month for 1.5% to 2%, no one is going to give you a GMP for beyond these days before you lock something in for more than a week. That's kind of a crazy cost environment we are. So in putting it all together, pricing car can sustain for a very long period of time in this kind of demand supply scenario. Now going back to your street rate conversation, I'll just give one example, and one example doesn't obviously is not represented on the whole portfolio. We have seen in April, some of our operators have raised street rates by 15%, while that in-house rate increases 8%, 9%, 10%, right? So we're starting to see for at least for a handful of operators, street rates has already -- increases are going above in-house rate increases. A phenomena we haven't seen, I don't know don't hold me to it. Probably, I don't know, probably 2013, '14 time frame. But so we're pretty excited about it. We think that we have a long runway of pricing increase here. And frankly, as we fundamentally believe that our residents expect a lot from us, they're paying a lot and they expect a lot to reserve a lot and for that, it just costs more today. Yes. So Nick, if you look at Page 12 of our business update, you will see some sense of how seasonally plays out, right? We have laid that out. Obviously, we expect better than seasonal trends, significantly better than seasonal trends. In the second quarter, but where you see the ship really takes off within the third quarter. So thinking about it without getting into month-to-month, as I have already indicated, the selling season, the summer selling season just started, right? We see very encouraging signs already and we think it will continue to improve as we go forward. Also remember, usually, every year in the Q1 is sort of when you go into -- from Q1 to Q2, going to start at a hole, right, because you lose occupancy. This year, we did not start at a hole, right? We built occupancy where you see occupancy decline. That will have a tremendous impact as you build the revenue line through the rest of the year. Tim, do you want to provide anything else? Three questions there, but we will welcome to our call. I will try to remember everything you want. First is, no, it doesn't excite us more or less investing is about price. It's not about exposure. I cannot say this million times enough and if we call for you guys to understand how we allocate capital. It is all about price. We own more senior housing than anyone. We bought more senior housing than anyone even the last 18 months. So senior housing is going to do significantly better. There has been no other beneficiary more beneficiary than us, right? So having said that, you think about the point, I also want to make sure you hear me. I said for a specific operator, I don't want you to think street rates are going up 15%, right? So everywhere, that's not what's happening. But we see broad momentum of increasing street rate pretty much everywhere with every operator, okay? So let's just put that in the context of understanding how senior housing works. Remember, you have an acuity creep as people age in place or age in a community, okay? So you will always have the portion who is living versus the person who is coming in, there's a gap, right? There's a gap because of that to decrease, the frailty and the acuity creep. What we are seeing, this rapidly rising street rate is closing that gap pretty meaningfully. And we hope that we'll see at some point that gap is going to come together. But at the same point, I understand, as we sort of get to the next year, right, there's going to be significant in-house rate increases again. So, you create another gap and you chase that gap again, right? That's how you build revenue. So, we're pretty optimistic. Generally speaking, the tone of your question is the right one, which excites us very much this moving, obviously, rates that we are starting to see, we'll see that will be sustained, all things being equal through the year and will show up in our top line growth as well as the NOI growth that Tim and John talked about. In fact, April probably was the best month we have seen from a net hiring perspective since we've started tracking this from the beginning of COVID. So you haven't seen the impact that we're talking about, you'll see that obviously in Q2 on a sequential basis, but again, I'm not going to comment on COVID. I have no way to predict what COVID is happening, not happening, going. But in a normalized market conditions, you will see that will improvement and will significantly expect the second half of the year. One thing about me that you probably have noticed over the years, we know each other that I'm extremely consistent. In 2018, I said there are two portfolios that I hope that we had in the RIDEA portfolio. In 2022, I'll tell you the same thing. And maybe if I couldn't convince the last one, I'll keep saying the same thing for years to come. So you should not expect a lot to change unless we believe, there is fundamentally economic reasons to change from RIDEA to triple net. Fundamentally, we believe it's the same business, different structures for different reasons, different growth profile. So I've gone through this in the call before, so I don't want to waste your time. But that just -- you should not expect a lot more except that one that I have hoped for, for many, many years. So let's just now take the second part of your question. So where you are today, Tim talked about it probably three, four calls in a row now, that we have a significant portion of our triple and portfolio in cash collection, right? And he mentioned when the growth comes back, you will see the other side of it. We have taken it on our chin, right, by putting in cash collection. And now we're on the other side. So obviously, that line item for these operators are behaving like RIDEA, right, because that's what they are. They are cash collection. So on top of that, we have a substantial number of leases that are marked to inflation. And as inflation is going up, so you have overall portfolio is going up. So, that probably -- these two together, probably 35%, 40% of the triple-net portfolio, and that's why you are seeing, obviously, that's why not only you are seeing, we continue to see significant sort of above average growth as long as we have average inflation that sort of in the system. Tim, do you want to add anything to that? Steve, I have no comments on HR HTA merger. I will say that it remains a fragmented industry that one player size or lag thereof doesn't really make a difference. It's a health system driven industry and remains a very, very fragmented industry. So I have no comments other than the fact we don't see anything changing. But I will offer a comment that I already have offered and bore you with details of what I've already said. At Welltower, we don't have a strategic acquisition. The only strategy that we have is to make money on a per share basis for existing shareholders. That is the only strategy we follow. And anything that doesn't fit to that model, we don't do it, right? So please understand, never count on us to do a strategic acquisition because we'll never will. Okay. I will -- I hope I remember all the questions. First, we're not going to get into how many of these transactions will be in OP units or not. We might have given some indication of our previous press releases on some of the transactions. But beyond that, we're not going to get into how many will be or will not be. We have a general sense, but we're not going to get into that. But let's just talk about something else that you asked, which is if you think about the pipeline of $1.5 billion under contract, right? Think about what Tim said, the $1.8 billion of capital that's raised in the ATM, but not settled. We have a few hundred million dollars of disposition, and that's just the equity piece, right? You add X million that you think will come from the OP side, and then on a 65-35, you will see our investment sort of dry power for investment is actually $3-plus billion today, right? So that's sort of the question. And is there anything else I did not answer. I can't remember three questions at the same time, Rich. But -- so I think I answered all your questions, if not just call me on my cell and we'll just walk you through. But we have ample capacity to invest capital that in the pipeline or could be in the shadow pipeline. Pipeline costs to deals under contract. Shadow pipeline is what we are negotiating. And as I said, off that $2-plus billion, we might do zero because we transact at our price and the price is the price. And if we can convince someone to come to our price, we will do that transaction. So very much of we have the capital raised, but I cannot guarantee you that we apply to any of these transactions."

            "name": "Tim McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2022 results. The performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter. Our capital activity our balance sheet liquidity update; and finally, our outlook for the second quarter. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.14 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.82 per diluted share, which was above the midpoint of our $0.79 to $0.84 per share guidance. Despite our results only including approximately $600,000 of HHS funds versus the $6 million expectation we had previously forecasted as part of our guidance. This quarter represented our first with year-over-year normalized FFO growth since the start of the pandemic. And when excluding provider relief funds received in the respective periods, or $0.82 per share represents 15% year-over-year growth versus the first quarter of 2021. We are also pleased to report that total portfolio same-store NOI growth turned positive in the quarter. With 8.9% year-over-year growth, which compares favorably to guidance of 7%. Turning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter years. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2021. In our seniors housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 6.9% year-over-year and exceeded our expectations, driven by improvements in rent collections on leases currently in cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.82x and with a sequential improvement, mainly driven by the conversion of Legend Senior Living today in the quarter. As indicated last quarter, we expect coverages to continue to move higher through the rest of the year as the positive inflection point we started experiencing our SHO portfolio in the first quarter will be reflected in our triple-net coverages on a one-quarter lag. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 1.8% year-over-year same-store NOI growth and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.3x. We completed $6.7 million of long-term post-acute sales in the quarter bringing our total sales in the last 12 months to $525 million and a blending cap rate is 7.5%, with an additional $202 million under contract for sale at quarter end. As a result, our long-term post-acute portfolio represented just 4.8% and of total in-place NOI at year-end versus 10.1% at the end of 2020, a 530 basis point decline driven largely by the exit of our Genesis relationship. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System, had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.02x. As a reminder, this lease is backed by the full corporate guarantee from ProMedica Health System. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the Company to capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to efficiently fund those near-term transactions. Since the start of the year, we have sold 21 million shares via forward sale agreement, an initial weighted average price of approximately $89.9 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.9 billion. We currently have approximately 19.5 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $1.8 billion. Additionally, we are seeing significant interest from potential sellers to accept OP units as consideration, providing further investment capacity. Taken together, our unsettled ATM proceeds, potential OP unit issuances and $352 million of expected property disposition and loan payoff proceeds provide ample capacity to fund our current investment pipeline. During the quarter, we issued our second green bond comprised of $550 million of 10-year unsecured debt maturing in 2032, with a coupon of 3.85%. Following a similar discipline in our equity funding strategy, this is our fourth unsecured issuance since March of 2021, bringing total debt issuance over the span of $2.3 billion with an average duration of 9.5 years and average coupon of 3%. At quarter end, when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. And when combined with the previously mentioned $2.1 billion of unsettled ATM proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we remain in a very strong liquidity position. Lastly, moving to our second quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0. 20 to $0.25 per share, normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.82 to $0.87 per share or $0.845 at the midpoint. This guidance takes into consideration approximately $6 million of HHS funds expected to be received in the second quarter. Guidance represents a $0.025 increase at the midpoint from our $0.82 per share number in 1Q. This $0.025 increase is composed of a $0. 04 sequential increase in our Senior Housing Operating portfolio NOI, $0.01 incremental increase in HHS funds and is offset by $0.025 of increased interest expense, lower foreign exchange rates, particularly the British pound, and dilution from development deliveries. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated in second quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth of 8% to 10%, driven by sub-segment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%; long-term post-acute 2% to 3%; Health System, positive 2.75% and senior housing triple net 7% to 8%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 20%, driven by revenue growth of 11% and underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 500 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and continued robust rate increases. We continue to be pleased by the momentum of the top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by a combination of rate and occupancy growth, setting the stage for a multiyear recovery to average occupancy in the portfolio at 76.4% at quarter end, nearly 1,100 basis points below pre-COVID levels and nearly 1,500 basis points below peak occupancy levels. We've described as recovery in the past as a coiled spring with both secular and cyclical tailwinds behind it. When we started to see the spring release in the core portfolio, we have made the conscious decision to steadily allocate capital to distressed, under-operated and often initially diluted properties, along with high-quality development projects. While this capital allocation has the effect of offsetting some of our core growth today, we will sustainably amplify it in the years to come. In short, we're working hard to keep that spring coil even as we start to realize the power of the earnings growth it can drive. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. No, I think that's right. We gave color on our last call when we do January results we spoke to kind of seeing a 10% decline from December to January. And we gave similar color to and seeing a little better than that as a trend for the full quarter. So I think it gives you a read, we kind of saw consistent decreases relative to the counterpart in the fourth quarter. Yes, I'd just add that from an average occupancy perspective, kind of speaking to that same point John just made, but because 1Q is historically negative, but even in this case, small game, average occupancy, which is kind of build off of the prior quarter and the current quarter recovery will accelerate into 3Q and does so historically. So, when we think about kind of sequential, the drive -- the part of it that's driven by occupancy will be its highest in the third quarter. Yes. So we peaked out at a little over 7% or 7.5% of our compensation line was agency in the fourth quarter. That came down to high 6x and we continue to expect that to normalize throughout the year. But just thinking about that from -- I think that's what you're asking, Mike, is just kind of what portion of that is agency. We expect that agency to continue to deflate. But remember, that gets backfilled by full-time hours. So it's not -- there will be some offset of that from full-time employees coming on. I'll just note that, that's something that we're certainly seeing progress on coming out of the first quarter and in April is that the focus our operators have put on hiring full-time employees and we all know that's the solution to agency. That's why we're seeing progress on the agency front because occupancy continues to build. So we're not seeing less of a demand for employees in the buildings. We're just seeing an ability to fill it more and more with our own staff versus agency. No, I'll just add, Juan, on your comment on coverages. So -- and restructuring -- so Shankh mentioned, we restructured a Legend lease in the quarter. We also restructured another triple-net lease in the quarter. And I would think about it from the timing makes sense given what we've talked about in the past, which is our operators were staying current with rent and resetting rents when they're staying current, and there's no line of sight and recovery doesn't make sense for other party. So I think what you've seen here is an ability to come to the table on Legend to get to an agreement that makes sense for both parties, and we think we'll do very well for Welltower shareholders over time. But as you look at the Welltower triple-net portfolio coming out of the first quarter, we're at mid-80s coverage on a portfolio that's 70%, 70.5% occupied. So, I think -- the important thing about the sustainability of that, I think, is quite high, given our view on the recovery. We said it all along. It's all recovery dependent, but we saw a strong recovery last year. We've seen rents continue to be paid. And we think given the occupancy there and the outlook in general in the space and where coverages are currently at, we're a pretty strong spot as far as sustainability of these rents and coverage recovery over the coming quarters. Yes. Thanks, Steve. And I think this is -- this will expand a bit on the comment in my opening remarks around just our continued steady allocation of capital to distressed situations, near-term dilutive, even developments, the idea that we're seeing core earnings growth that's really driving the portfolio now. And we're making long-term capital allocation decisions that are going to create sustainable growth over a multiyear period. And if I kind of take that in think about it in perspective of this quarter, and talked about same-store NOI growth on a year-over-year basis. So you go back to the second quarter of 2021, on the call, I spoke to a $0.77 per share number, if you back out out-of-period government grants. So this compares to $0.835 number ex HHS with our 2Q guide. And I think the right way to think about bridging this is kind of three different buckets. So you've got the core portfolio, which is to your comment on same-store driven by same-store growth, 9% cash same-store growth equates to about lever 10% FFO growth number. Then you've got accretion from investments over kind of the last three quarters, you've got an offset of $0.03 from a combination of higher interest expense, higher G&A and then lower exchange rates on a year-over-year basis. So if you dig in that investment accretion number a bit more, over the last three quarters, we have invested about $4.8 billion in capital. We've delivered another $500 million in developments. So we've got $5.3 billion of capital fully funded on the balance sheet as of 3/31 and it's expected to yield in the low 4s in that guide. So keep in mind that these assets are significantly under earning where they're going to be long term and near term, it's because of operator transitions and lease-up within our recent deliveries. And of course, agency has also been a factor there. As these investments stabilize, they represent about $0.10 per share of FFO per quarter or $0.40 annually. So just from the last kind of three quarters of capital allocation. And lastly, I'd just note, we've talked about our NOI bridge in our investor presentation and this is under 1/3 of that upside represented there. So it's kind of a snapshot within our year-over-year growth, showing how the capital we're putting to work is just creating the sustained earnings growth over a number of years going forward. You think about a pass-through, I guess, you mean from like a direct billing? I'd say, all of it, we have an operating profit in that business. So you're making a profit on 1 basis. You're certainly seeing part of the rationale for rent increase being to offset inflationary pressures in both those categories. But those aren't things -- food is something -- you're certainly in a lot of these different contracts you're highlighting as being a separate cost. Utilities generally not, but that's all wrapped into how pricing for the product works. So, I think when we talk about kind of seeing inflationary plus type rental increases. We're talking about the ability to offset the pressure we're seeing in food and utility inflation."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the Welltower Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that this call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Matthew McQueen, General Counsel. You may begin your conference.\nMatthew McQueen: Thank you and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on a reasonable assumption, the company can give no assurances that projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and describe high level business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the operational performance of our Senior Housing and Outpatient Medical portfolios and progress on our operating platform build-out. Nikhil will give you an update on the investment landscape. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and 2024 full year guidance. First, as I reflect back on 2023, it was a year of solid execution across the Board with significant progress achieved in all aspects of the business. Operating performance far surpassed our initial expectations. We had a great year, a record-setting year in terms of capital deployment and we meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity profile. Just as importantly, perhaps, is the groundwork we laid to sustain this level of performance and continue to deliver outsized growth not only in 2024 but also well into the future. This includes the considerable progress John and his team have made on the build-out of our operating platform, which we continue to believe will transform the industry. On top of that, as we have discussed in recent quarters, we have executed a number of operator transitions across all our geographies, as well as converted a handful of properties from triple-net to RIDEA. All should bear fruit later this year and in 2025. We finished the year strong with significant momentum to set us up for another year of solid performance in 2024. In terms of our Senior Housing Operating portfolio, I was particularly encouraged by the occupancy growth in fourth quarter, which is seasonally not the strongest period. The portfolio saw 110 basis points of sequential occupancy gains, which translate into 330 basis points year-over-year occupancy growth, and the 330 basis points year-over-year occupancy growth is by far the highest level we have ever achieved in the fourth quarter of any year in our recorded history. Just as compelling is that looking at the intra-quarter trends, year-over-year occupancy growth strengthened each month, which is unusual given the aforementioned seasonality of the business. We\u2019re also pleased with the rate growth achieved by our managers. During our last call, I described to you that one of our largest operators, Sunrise, pulled forward Jan 1, 2023 rate increases into 4Q 2022. This year they have returned to their historical cadence of Jan 1 rate increases. While this distorts our show portfolio\u2019s reported Q4 2023 RevPOR or the unit revenue, the rest of the portfolio delivered RevPOR growth of 6.8%, reflecting the underlying fundamental strength of the business. While our 2024 guidance assumes some diminution of RevPOR growth from full year of 2023 levels of 6.6%, we still expect another year of near double-digit topline growth as occupancy continues to build at a solid pace. 4Q 2023, same-store ExpPOR or expense per occupied room grew 1.7% year-over-year. The lowest level of growth in Welltower\u2019s recorded history, driven by 4Q 2023 same-store compensation per occupied room growth, which grew 1.9% year-over-year, also the lowest growth in Welltower\u2019s recorded history. While the normalization of agency labor usage is helping to dampen COMPOR growth, we are also seeing some good trends in the salary and the wages line. All of these trends are resulting in a favorable spread between RevPOR growth and ExpPOR growth. The powerful combination of this revenue backdrop with continued margin expansion that should be expected due to the high operating leverage inherent in the business leaves us feeling very strongly about our 2024 NOI growth setup. Tim will give you our detailed buildup of our NOI guidance based on our current assumptions, but please understand that we have no false pretense about perfectly knowing what the business will look like as we move through the years, particularly the all-important summer months. But we are optimistic, given the demand-supply backdrop, which improves by the day and the rising system-wide occupancy, as well as the early success we have seen in John\u2019s operating platform buildout. While 24.4% NOI growth last year for our shop portfolio alone was very encouraging, I\u2019m extremely pleased with our capital allocation activities as well. In 2023 was the most active year in our history in terms of raising and deploying capital. We completed almost $6 billion of investments in the year, nearly half of which closed in Q4 alone. While I won\u2019t get into the specific transactions, I will mention that they share some common characteristics. First, we generally grew with our existing operating partners in their respective markets. Second, we acquired assets at a significant discount to replacement costs from core funds, PE funds, pension funds and financial institutions who were seeking liquidity. We also added a couple of new operating partners along the way who I envision us growing with in the near-term. More to come on this topic as we progress through the year. The torrid pace of investment activity in Q4 has continued with 2024 starting off with a bang. In fact, I do not recall having ever been this busy in first quarter on the deal front. While we have pre-negotiated documents and structure to leverage, it is great trust that we have built with our 2023 counterparties that will make follow-on transactions easier to execute. These counterparties also experienced what our promise always is, that we honor our handshake irrespective of circumstances, as evidenced by the continued -- our continued execution through this historic capital market volatility in the fall and winter of 2023. They know that we remain the clean shirt in an industry where re-trading counterparties is the norm. It is interesting and perhaps coincidental that we\u2019re experiencing another bout of market volatility after a few weeks have come. Over the past few weeks, another regional banking crisis driven by U.S. CRE debt appears to be rearing its ugly head from New York to Tokyo to Germany. We are currently staring at approximately $16 billion of Senior Housing loans maturing in the next 24 months in the U.S., which dwarfs roughly about a couple of billion dollars of agency financing completed in 2023. This should generate significant equity, as well as private credit opportunity for us. Suffice to say, our near-term capital deployment pipeline remains robust, highly visible and actionable, and with -- and squarely within our circle of competence, where we can bet with house odds rather than gambler\u2019s odds. Along with what we have already done in 2023, these acquisitions that carry an attractive basis, operational upside and significant value-add from Welltower\u2019s operating platform, we have a -- we will have a meaningful impact on what remains a true North Star, long-term compounding of partial value of our existing short loans. With that, I will hand the call over to John. John?\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh. Although most of my time at Welltower has spent doing the Welltower hustle, getting up every day, identifying and aggressively pursuing the opportunities that exist, focused on improving the customer and employee experience. I want to take a moment and reflect on how proud I am of the Welltower team for success in doing just that, improving the customer and employee experience, which in part is reflected by our performance. Focusing on Senior Housing for a moment, the Welltower team consists of our top operators and all of their employees, our key vendors, as well as the Welltower employees. We have all worked together to improve the customer and employee experience, which has resulted in fantastic results. On top of the industry-leading Senior Housing same-store NOI growth for the full year of 2022 of 20.1%, our full year 2023 Senior Housing NOI growth was 24.4%. Often on earnings calls, you hear the words, tough cost. That\u2019s certainly true here. Yet our guidance for 2024 same-store Senior Housing NOI growth at the midpoint is 18%. Therefore, based on our two full years that are completed and in the record books, 2022 and 2023, and our guidance of 18% in 2024, that indicates that the three-year compounded growth of our same-store Senior Housing NOI in 2024 will be over 75%. That\u2019s something to reflect upon. Thank you, Welltower team. Now back to our business. Our portfolio generated 12.5% same-store NOI growth over the prior year\u2019s quarter, led by the Senior Housing Operating portfolio with 23.7% year-over-year growth. The Outpatient Medical portfolio produced same-store portfolio growth of 2.8% for the fourth quarter of 2023. This was driven by favorable operating expense management, increasing the operating margin by 220 basis points year-over-year to 71.4%. Notably, our proactive appeal process achieved favorable real estate tax reductions. The 23.7% fourth quarter year-over-year NOI increased in our same-store Housing Operating portfolio with a function of 9.7% revenue growth, driven by the combination of 5.5% RevPOR growth and 330 basis points of average occupancy gain and moderating expense growth. Expenses remain in control, coming in at 5.7% for the quarter over the prior year\u2019s quarter. The strong revenue growth and expense control led to continued margin expansion of 290 basis points. Again, our ExpPOR growth for the quarter set a record for the lowest growth in our recorded history at 1.7%. All three regions continue to show strong same-store revenue growth, starting with the U.S. at 9.4%, Canada and the U.K. growing at 9.7% and 14.1%, respectively. The strong revenue growth in each region, combined with the expense control, have led to fantastic NOI growth in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. of 21.8%, 21.7% and 75.5%, respectively. We\u2019re flying along with our integrated platform initiative, which will start to go live at our first operator in the first half of this year. I will not go into all the details, but I will say that our focus on improving the customer and employee experience is coming together very well. The integrations of the various modules will simplify the customer experience and reduce the labor around basic tasks, enabling our site teams to focus on what they love, our customers. More to come in 2024. I will now turn the call over to Tim.\nNikhil Chaudhri: I\u2019ll go next. Yeah. Thanks, John. On the transaction side, as Shankh mentioned, 2023 marked the most active year in the history of the company. Our new investment activity of almost $6 billion spanned more than 50 different transactions with a median transaction size of $54 million, in which we acquired 153 properties over the course of the year. I am sure you all have read about the confluence of a few factors that are creating the current investment backdrop, namely the great wall of CRE debt maturity, expiring SOFR caps, pressure on the regional bank balance sheet and the denominator effect. Welltower is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends and serve as a counterparty of choice for our private equity sponsors, large pension and asset managers, and entrepreneurs that are impacted by this challenge. We are able to source these opportunities directly from sellers or through our operating partners, given our reputation of being a good partner and a reliable and credible counterparty. We are then able to analyze and underwrite quickly and in great detail, thanks to the combination of our data analytics platform, Alpha, and our best in business investment team. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we then execute on the business plan for each asset through our deep network of aligned operating partners backed by the operating platform that John is methodically building out. These factors drive our sustainable competitive advantage for creating shareholder value. Our 2023 investment activity was focused on granular, off-market, high conviction transactions. A majority of the transactions were focused on our seniors and wellness housing businesses, where we acquired additional assets and markets where we already have high performing assets. By acquiring these assets at an attractive basis and consolidating operations under the same operator, we are able to reap the operating benefits of regional density. In the fourth quarter alone, we closed on nearly $3 billion of investments while remaining targeted and disciplined. We acquired 44 Senior Housing properties from 11 different sellers, growing our relationship with seven existing operating partners. We acquired roughly 8,800 units with an average age of around seven years at an average basis of $222,000 per unit at an approximately 40% discount to replacement costs. These transactions have a low 6s year one yield and are expected to generate unlevered IRRs north of 10%. I am also excited to provide an update on the performance of our Integra portfolio, where we have continued to see a sequential improvement in performance. For the 140 buildings that first transitioned to regional operators, we have seen annualized EBITDARM improve by more than $300 million, from losing more than $85 million in the three months prior to the transition to positive $228 million in the third quarter. While there continues to be meaningful remaining upside in performance beyond the current state, I am pleased to announce that EBITDARM coverage is now greater than one and a half times. We also transitioned the last seven remaining buildings earlier this month after getting the final set of regulatory approvals. On the back of our continued success turning around operations for our legacy Genesis and ProMedica skilled nursing portfolios, we have take -- we were active in deploying capital in the skilled space as we partnered with regional operators to acquire under managed assets. Given the credit nature of our skilled nursing investments, we always strive to have meaningful downside protection through a combination of right per bed basis in states with favorable reimbursement landscape and significant credit protection through personal and entity level guarantees. Looking ahead to 2024, we are off to an exciting start. We are delighted to announce our strategic partnership with Affinity Living Communities in which we are entering into a long-term programmatic development relationship and acquiring the Affinity portfolio of 25 active adult properties with an average age of less than eight years for $969 million or $233,000 per unit after allocating the NPV of interest cost savings to the assumed below market debt. Darin, Scott, Charlie, and John have built a fantastic business over the last decade as they have meticulously iterated and refined the Affinity prototype. Their vertically integrated platform and unwavering focus on efficiency has enabled them to grow their footprint in typically expensive Pacific Northwest markets at an attractive basis to provide moderately priced active adult housing at average rents of approximately $2,100 per month. We have been incredibly pleased with the operating performance of our moderately priced active adult business over the last few years and are excited to partner with the Affinity team to further grow that business. Our investment team remains incredibly busy as we continue to be the steady hand and trusted counterparty in our business and remain well-positioned to capitalize on capital structure issues across the industry. We are inundated with opportunities up and down the capital stack and continue to balance price discipline, operator selection and capital availability to be thoughtful stewards of our shareholder\u2019s capital. I will now hand over the call to Tim to walk through our financial results in 2024.\nTim McHugh: Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, performance of our triple-net investment segments, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update, and finally, the introduction of our full year 2024 outlook. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.15 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.96 per diluted share, representing 15.7% year-over-year growth. We also reported total portfolio, same-store NOI growth of 12.5% year-over-year. Now turn to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 9/30/2023. In our Senior Housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 2.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.95 times. It is also worth noting that our trailing three-month coverage in this segment moved above 1 times for the first time since the pandemic. Next, same-store NOI in a long-term post-acute portfolio group grew 5.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.36 times. Turn to capital activity. We invested $3 billion in acquisitions, loans and developments in the quarter, led by $2.1 billion of Senior Housing Operating investments. In the quarter, we continue to fund investment activity via equity issuance, completing a bought equity deal in November, which along with regular way ATM activity resulted in $2.8 billion of gross proceeds in the quarter, an average price of $86.20 per share. This equity issuance allowed us to fund investment activity, along with the extinguishment of approximately $250 million of debt in the quarter and end the year with a $2.1 billion cash balance. Staying with the balance sheet, as we finish 2023, I want to highlight the balance sheet transformation that has occurred over the last 24 months. When COVID hit in 2020, we acted quickly to protect the balance sheet by securing substantial incremental liquidity, in large part by reducing cash outlays and taking advantage of strong asset values by selling long lease duration assets into a zero interest rate environment. These actions helped alleviate the impact of nearly 50% drawdown in Senior Housing Operating NOI that bottomed out in the first quarter of 2021, driving peak leverage to nearly 7.5 times ex-HHS funds. After stabilizing the portfolio in the sevens in 2021, the combination of a strong recovery in Senior Housing performance and disciplined equitization of external growth over the last two years has allowed us to methodically lower leverage, finishing this year with 5.03 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Consistent with past commentary around the balance sheet, I want to underscore that despite the improvements in metrics, current leverage still does not reflect a full post-COVID recovery in Senior Housing Operating NOI, as our portfolio still sits meaningfully below pre-COVID NOI levels. A recovery back to these levels will drive leverage well below 5 times. In summary, in 2023, our post-COVID balance sheet recovery transitioned into a strategic repositioning, ending the year with substantially upgraded metrics from prior to the pandemic, an expectation for further improvement as our Senior Housing Operating portfolio continues to carry significant organic cash flow growth momentum into 2024. This positions us with substantial capacity to continue to make systematically opportunistic capital allocation decisions to drive long-term shareholder returns in any market environment. Lastly, as I move on to the introduction of our full year 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not included any investment activity in our outlook beyond that which has already been announced publicly. Last night, we introduced an initial full year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders of $1.21 per diluted share to $1.37 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.94 per diluted share to $4.10 per diluted share or $4.02 at the midpoint. As mentioned in our release last night, our 2024 guidance contemplates no HHS or other government grants, so after adjusting for $0.03 received in 2023, the midpoint of our initial guidance represents 11.5% year-over-year growth. This year-over-year increase in FFO per share is composed of a $0.33 increase from higher year-over-year Senior Housing Operating NOI, $0.02 increase from higher NOI in our Outpatient Medical and triple-net lease portfolios, a $0.04 headwind from higher year-over-year growth in G&A expenses tied mainly to the continued build-out of our operating platform, and finally, a $0.10 increase from investment activity and financing activity. Underlying this FFO guidance is an estimate of total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8.25% to 11.5%, driven by sub-segment growth of Outpatient Medical 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute 2% to 3%, Senior Housing triple-net 2.5% to 4%, and finally, Senior Housing Operating growth of 15% to 21%, the midpoint of which is driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.2%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation for RevPOR growth of approximately 5.25% and an acceleration in year-over-year occupancy growth to 290 basis points. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. I wanted to address a few important topics before I open the call up for questions. As you may know, on November 28th, we lost my personal hero, mentor and friend, Charlie Munger. We\u2019re deeply saddened by his death and thank many of you for reaching out to my team and me during this difficult time. Charlie was truly generous with his wisdom, continually guiding us not only on the importance of compounding, but also behaving like owners, not managers and deserving great partners by being one, and taking far less crowded high road and acting with conviction when the conditions were right. We witnessed his wit, uncommon sense, simplicity, passion for multidisciplinary running and innate ability to cut through noise and arrive at the right decision. The influence he had on Welltower, its people and its culture is truly immeasurable. His serene guidance and sage, principled advice has been invaluable to me in my life and my career. Charlie was also an instrumental influence on the members of our senior leadership team to whom he gave his greatest gift of all time, his time. We\u2019re grateful for the time we spent in his presence. I owe him a lifetime debt that cannot be repaid, but we will carry forward his teachings in how we deal with our owners, partners, residents, employees and others. His most profound impact on us is perhaps cemented in the ground rule document that he guided me to write that you can find on our website. Moving on to a less somber topic, I want to draw your attention to some of the partners which we forged new relationship with in 2023. Beyond what we have announced so far, I want to highlight Affinity as our new growth partner. Nikhil walked you through the investment rational Affinity, but I would also like to express how excited I am to work with Darin Davidson and his team there. As we have gotten to know Darin over the last five years, he has proven to be a man of high integrity and thoughtfulness with a true compass on the future direction of how older Americans want to live. Despite adding a few handful of managers to our growth platform in 2023, our partner and geographic strategy remains to go deep instead of going broad and our consolidating roster of existing managers reflect that. In summary, I hope that the optimism conveyed by my partners today on growth prospect of our business has resonated with you. While we remain focused on the execution of our 2024 strategic and operational goals, I cannot help but draw your attention to the outsized multiyear growth trajectory in front of us, which is supported by five different growth pillars. Number one, some of it is questionably is a function of favorable demand supply setup that I think you all understand. This should only get better as we look into 2025 and 2026. Number two, a lot of my personal enthusiasm stems from the digital transformation and business process optimization that John is driving. We should start to see some fruits of his labor this year, but much more in 2025 and 2026. Number three, overlay that with the impact of hundreds of properties that we have recently transitioned or agreed to transition to better operators. I am excited about the improving resident and employee experience that is currently underway with a financial impact following soon thereafter. Number four, add our extremely targeted and disciplined growth, external growth opportunities. And last but not least, number five, our underleveraged balance sheet that which Tim just described to you. We will continue to experience further organic deleveraging, which will either support A rating or provide capacity for additional external growth. As we think about the next couple of years, we have never felt better about the growth prospects or accelerating growth prospects of our earnings and cash flow for our company on a partial basis. With that, I will open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Connor Siversky with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nConnor Siversky: Good morning out there. Thank you for the time and appreciate the detail in your prepared remarks. So an observation, a couple short questions on wellness housing. The Affinity portfolio generating a 60% operating margin, not exactly comparable, but seems to be above the range that a traditional assisted living facility could achieve. So first question on this end, where does that 60% margin sit on the bell curve of wellness housing operating performance outcomes? Second, with what looks like a very solid return profile, how much should we expect Welltower to lean into this segment in the years ahead? And finally, how has RevPOR and NOI growth in that portfolio trended over the last two to three years?\nShankh Mitra: You snuck in three questions. Let me see if I can understand or remember all of them. First is we laid out our strategy of how we see investing in the senior living space, which is high price point, very affluent micro market, high acuity product, if you will, where we provide a service that can be actually charged accordingly and hire people and pay them appropriately. So that\u2019s one strategy. On the other side of the barbell, we went from no acuity and build out a business over the last eight -- six years, five years, six years on this wellness housing side, where it\u2019s much lower price point, but almost no services. So it\u2019s sort of from an acuity standpoint and that provides obviously much higher NOI margin. That\u2019s the two business segment that we know how to do well and make money and that\u2019s where we are. I\u2019m not suggesting that anything in between is not something that is right or wrong or anything like that, but just not something that we\u2019re focused on. Going back to your question, where that 60% or so margin sits in that wellness housing spectrum, I will say it sits towards the upper end, probably, the upper half, but no means and aberration, right? So you think about, I think about this business from mostly a mid-50%s to mid-60% margin business. Your last question, how has the growth has been in the wellness housing? Historically, it has been growing, I would say, mid-to-high single-digit. In 2023, the NOI growth for our wellness housing portfolio on a same-store basis has been 12.2%. In fourth quarter alone, that was 13.1%. Hope I remember all your questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJeff Spector: Great. Good morning and congratulations on a great year. A bunch of questions, but I\u2019ll just focus on one. After three years of very strong, better than expected internal growth, the market appears to be pricing in approximately 700 basis points to 800 basis points of deceleration. As we look ahead, does growth normalize from here or can the current growth trajectory continue?\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Jeff, for the question. I\u2019ll start probably with one of my favorite mongerisms, which is knowing what you don\u2019t know is actually a lot more useful than being brilliant. So I want to make sure you understand that, we have no hubris of what we don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m, frankly speaking, I\u2019m pretty surprised, for many months, I\u2019ve been reading about this in research reports, talking to investors, that sort of this idea that if you had three -- two good years of numbers, obviously, that has to go down pretty meaningfully. Frankly speaking, I don\u2019t personally understand that. I will tell you that we don\u2019t know how this year is going to completely play out. We give you our best guess that Tim described to you. It is possible that we have another year of that growth rate that\u2019s sort of similar to last two years, possible if we have a strong summer sort of leasing season, right? But I think we\u2019re going to have many great years in front of us with double-digit NOI growth. Now, with -- whether this year, next year, this quarter, next quarter, I don\u2019t know what chips will fall, but as we think about taking this portfolio to where it should be leased with our opinion, as we have told you, that we\u2019ll be very disappointed if we go back to pre-COVID. There is no reason we can\u2019t even go back to where 2015 levels were, because if you look forward next few years, you will see demand-supply has been significantly better and our platform build out should help us get well past that. We should have double-digit NOI growth for years to come. I hope that sort of answers your question. We have no hubris of sort of knowing what we don\u2019t know. But we think it\u2019s also this idea that, because our business has done so well for last two years, it has to go down, it has to meaningfully decelerate, it sorts of reminds me that, perhaps, we should have more humility of what we don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see how this plays out. We\u2019ll see what market gives us. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to -- you have very strong outlook on shop. I wanted to dig into that a bit more in two parts. One, can you talk about sort of at the high end of your guidance range, what you or maybe the low end, what you\u2019ve baked in for RevPOR growth? And then related to that, as you sort of trend towards 85%-ish, 86% occupancy, clearly there are benefits to the bottomline. But I wanted to understand, do you -- do the operators need to stuff up or spend more marketing dollars? Is there a maybe some broad trends that you can share with us to achieve that 85% of the margin flow too?\nTim McHugh: Yeah. I will start with the RevPOR and then I\u2019ll hand it over to John for any comment on kind of the operating spend side. But thinking about the RevPOR, think about kind of 5 to 5.5 being kind of the range that drives, that kind of flexes from the bottom to the top of that range.\nJohn Burkart: Yeah. So on the -- how the numbers work, as Shankh and Tim has said for a long time, the flow through gets pretty fantastic as you get north of 80%. So when you talk about staffing up, you really have, and I mentioned this on the last call, the positions are in place. You have your head chef, you have your executive director, et cetera, et cetera. So it\u2019s very incremental. So this arc of the curve, there\u2019s a lot of money that comes to the bottomline as you increase occupancy. And additionally, as we\u2019ve said, because of supply-demand factors, that\u2019s just expected in the marketplace. We may or may not decide to spend more money on marketing to accelerate that, but the conditions are fantastic right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Hughes: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the time. I wanted to ask about the trajectory of external growth. You lay out in the business update deck the opportunity to deploy in excess of $3 billion annually with your current stable of proprietary developers and operators. And on top of that are, of course, the opportunities outside of those relationships that could be added of like Affinity. I know you don\u2019t provide guidance on investment activity, but is it fair to assume $3 billion is kind of the low end we can expect year in, year out, given that, these partners of yours, they want to grow their businesses and they can only grow with you due to the proprietary nature of your partnerships? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Jonathan, let me see if I can answer that question. We will not give guidance. Our shop is not designed to buy stuff. We only grow if we think we can grow to add value on a partial basis for existing investors. So, if that means it\u2019s $3 billion, it\u2019s $3 billion. That means it\u2019s $300 million, it\u2019s $300 million and that means if it\u2019s $8 billion, it\u2019s $8 billion. That\u2019s sort of where we are. Having said that, if you look at the page seven of our slide deck, we see there\u2019s a massive amount of loans in the Senior Housing space that are rolling. That\u2019s just a U.S. number. We\u2019re also seeing opportunities in both the U.K. and Canada, similar ideas and there is not enough credit in the system to reify this. So we think the opportunity set, obviously, in front of us is going to be very robust. Speaking of pipeline right now, I want to reiterate the comment that I have made in my prepared remarks. We have never been this busy in Q1. As you understand, there is a seasonality of the deal business as well, right? People work really, really hard into the year end to close out the year and Q1 is usually very, sort of, you don\u2019t see a lot of activity, activity starts to pick up, obviously, in Q2 and then that\u2019s obviously translated into heavy second half. And that normal seasonality, we haven\u2019t seen, and perhaps, because of the debt curve that we\u2019re talking about, perhaps, it\u2019s because of another thing that Nikhil mentioned, which is the interest caps that are coming up and regional banks were nowhere to be found, right? So, in that context, I think, we\u2019re going to have a record year again. But who knows? If we don\u2019t see the opportunities to invest, we won\u2019t. But the pipeline remains robust, it\u2019s visible, it\u2019s actionable and we can see massive amount of value creation coming through that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nShankh Mitra: Tayo?\nTayo Okusanya: Hello?\nShankh Mitra: Tayo, we can hear you. Hello?\nTayo Okusanya: Okay.\nShankh Mitra: Tayo, we can hear you.\nTayo Okusanya: Perfect. So, good morning, and then congrats on a great quarter and a great outlook. On the regulatory front, again, in the past few weeks or so, there\u2019s been some discussion. The House was kind of doing some hearings on Senior Housing and some concerns around maybe ultimately you also see some minimum staffing rules in Senior Housing. Just kind of curious what you\u2019re hearing on your end, how you kind of see that evolving over time and what that could mean for profitability for Senior Housing operators.\nJohn Burkart: Yeah. Thanks, Tayo. Obviously, we\u2019re very aware of the conversations taking place on the regulatory side. I think something that\u2019s consistent with how we\u2019ve talked about this in the past is, this business, the Senior Housing side, we almost entirely play in a private pay business where the delivery of a high quality product and reputation in the market is the most important driver of your business on a go-forward basis. And so, I think, there\u2019s areas of the healthcare world where that\u2019s not the same and you\u2019ve got more of a captive demand audience and there\u2019s more concern over how you may run a business. But on the Senior Housing side, what we know very well, both the good and the bad, is that the business is entirely driven by reputation. So, it continues to be the focus of ours is that, whether it\u2019s the staffing levels, the level of care, the quality of the employees, they are what drives the business day in, day out and it\u2019s why we spend so much time focusing on creating these sustainable models for property level.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jim Kammert with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJim Kammert: Good morning. Thank you. Just tying some of the previous questions together, if I could, thinking about Affinity, those are pretty attractive margins, and obviously, they\u2019re very savvy operators and then you tie together the opportunity set in terms of maturing loans on page seven of your deck. Are there other wellness or active adult type opportunities within that set of the $16 billion or so debt maturities, thinking about your overall margin implications for your portfolio as it changes?\nShankh Mitra: That -- I believe that the Senior Housing loan situation we\u2019re talking about is the traditional Senior Housing product. You can, for some lender, can sort of define this as multifamily, some can Senior Housing. So, there\u2019s no way to specifically know. We play into the mid-market segment of that active adult, the wellness housing segment. You think about there are four large players in that space that we know of is that there are others, but the four major ones that we know of, Clover, Calamar, Sparrow and Affinity, and all four of them are existing Welltower partners today. As I have mentioned before, I believe in going deep, not going broad. If we find more opportunities, we will obviously see how that stacks up against our growth potentials, et cetera, but we are definitely focused on growing our business. And I think you would say starting this business six years ago to about 25,000 units today, we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of it. But growth for growth\u2019s sake is something that I just can\u2019t get my head around. Our job is to create long-term shareholder value, compounding on a partial basis what we\u2019re after. So, we\u2019ll see if we can do it, but I will be optimistic that wellness housing over a period of time will become a very significant portion of Welltower portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yeah. Thank you. Shankh, just kind of touching again on the investment pipeline and all the factors you\u2019ve laid out today of -- and previously as to why that opportunity continues to expand. I guess I\u2019m curious how big the investment pipeline you see today is sort of fee simple real estate deals versus the credit opportunities and how much of that expansion that you\u2019ve seen in the investment pipeline more recently is a function of the credit opportunity side versus\u2026\nShankh Mitra: Yeah.\nAustin Wurschmidt: \u2026 the more traditional fee simple.\nShankh Mitra: Austin, I just want to make sure I understand your question. A lot of opportunity that we are seeing are driven by current existing owners\u2019 credit situation, whether that\u2019s rate caps, whether that\u2019s LTV, whether that\u2019s DSCR, whether that\u2019s refi. So it\u2019s driven by credit situations on their end. How we execute that on our end could be credit or could be equity and vast majority of what we have done is equity opportunities. But we are interested in the private credit side as an equity owner. I\u2019ve said this many, many times that we\u2019re just not lenders. We are owner of those properties at the last dollar basis where we\u2019re credit stands, right. So that\u2019s how we think about it. In other words, that we\u2019re very comfortable taking back the keys if the buyer decides to -- the owner decides to do so. However, vast majority of our execution on our end is on the equity side, though we remain very interested for the right opportunities on the -- in the -- to play in the credit stack. However, I will tell you, we never loan against assets at a last dollar value at a given location for a product that we do not want to own. That is not what we do. So that\u2019s something that\u2019s very interesting for you to sort of think through.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. It\u2019s Nick Joseph here with Michael. Shankh, you\u2019ve obviously talked about the robust acquisition opportunities a lot on the call and then the multi-year growth that you expect from senior sales. And so curious how you are seeing competition for both assets and loans. Is this attracting additional capital into the space and then also just some more question on the development side. Obviously, we haven\u2019t seen development pick up yet, but given the multiyear growth outlook, when would you expect that to start to pick back up?\nShankh Mitra: Yeah. I think from a competition perspective, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, most of the transactions -- all of the transactions that we\u2019ve executed on, they have been privately negotiated directly with the sellers. So it\u2019s not that we\u2019re participating in auctions or anything like that and a big part of that is there is really no liquidity in the market. So we\u2019re not seeing any competition really. And then, I think, remind me again, what was your second question?\nNikhil Chaudhri: Let me answer that question. That was the development question.\nShankh Mitra: Yeah.\nNikhil Chaudhri: We -- Nick, we put out a page eight in our slide decks that could be informative for some thinking about this question. If you think about there are some interesting things to think through. One, let\u2019s just talk about things that we all know. Cost of construction is up significantly. Cost of capital, you just think about it, a Senior Housing development loan today, if you can get one, good luck with that, even we struggling to get one, if we need one, is at 350, 400 over. So, you\u2019re talking about your debt cost-to-capital in the ninth and the 10th, right? No, we haven\u2019t seen a development pro forma that works. That\u2019s sort of a financial aspect you guys know, then obviously think through what it takes to an average, I\u2019m not talking middle of Manhattan, West LA, west side of Boston, places like that. An average Welltower location in a very wealthy micro market in East Coast, West Coast or locations like that probably takes two years to three years of redevelopment and you know that it takes a couple of years of construction after that. But what is more interesting that we have noticed is last 12 months to 18 months, that a lot of the changes that happened because of what I just described to you, in the platforms that have developed most of the Senior Housing assets, they have been dismantled. So if you look at page eight, we have added something for you to sort of ponder over is the first thing that needs to happen if people can find money and they think it\u2019s a good thing to do is to first build back the human capital side before you think about the financial capital side. The last thing I will leave you with to think about, my understanding is developers build or develop product to sell at a profit. When majority of the product traded in last three years at $0.70 on the $1, what confidence do you have that when you build a product for $1 that you will get a $1.30? I don\u2019t think the confidence would be very high on the equity side, and obviously, you\u2019ll take out financing when there is no acquisition financing, because that rollover we just described in the previous one, we think development in any meaningful way is years away. But again, as I said, we don\u2019t know the future. That\u2019s what seems logical. We\u2019ll see what the future plays out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMike Mueller: Yeah. I guess following up on development for the Affinity Development Program, how soon do you think we could see starts there and is there a way to size up how big the annual investment outlay could be that you could ramp up to?\nShankh Mitra: Yeah. Mike, so my question, my answer to Nick\u2019s question was focused on Senior Housing development, as in what do you understand as a regular Senior Housing product. Affinity or wellness housing, these are apartments, right? These are not where care gets delivered. So that -- these are housing products. These are rental housing products. How can it be? I\u2019ll tell you, probably if you think about it, Nikhil said, average age is eight years. The portfolio size is 25. So just call it three, four starts a year, something like that would be something that I would expect. But we don\u2019t know, it depends on where the product is year-over-year. What the current pipeline is. But something like that can be expected over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pawlowski: Yeah. Thanks for the time. John, I was curious if you could share a current stat on average age and move-in for your traditional Senior Housing portfolio, how it compares to pre-COVID? And just any big shifts you guys are seeing in terms of the demographics coming in the door or the behavior of the current tenants again versus pre-COVID. We would love to hear?\nJohn Burkart: Yeah. Good question. And what I am seeing is a little bit longer stays. As far as for the details of that, I don\u2019t have that specific information, I can look to see if I can get it and get it back to you offline.\nShankh Mitra: John, I\u2019ll just add that if you look at the coming out of the pandemic, average age and acuity went up right just coming out of the pandemic and sort of first three months, six months, something like that month where we\u2019ve seen the acuity has gone up and the average age has gone up. As we sort of things have normalized, I will say we\u2019re hearing more and more comments from our operating partners that average age is coming down and length of stay because of that acuity is coming down, but length of stay is going up because of that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks. I\u2019m impressed with your guys\u2019 occupancy gains reaccelerating. Is that mostly driven by move-ins coming in or is it kind of the dynamic that you\u2019re talking about in the last question related to move-outs as you\u2019re seeing longer length of stays? So maybe move-outs are trending a little bit lower to helping that that occupancy gain reaccelerate in 2024?\nShankh Mitra: So, Mike, let me try to answer that question. I was just looking at this a couple of days ago. Interestingly, as we looked at the fourth quarter data is, obviously, we\u2019re talking about the context sort of seasonal trends that we have seen in fourth quarter, specifically looking at that, both move-ins and move-outs were better. So we have seen better move-in rates, move-in trends, and we have seen better move-out trends. So that sort of both created this unusual seasonal pattern. As you have noted, not only the quarter was kind of interesting, or frankly, confounding in a positive way from a seasonality standpoint, but what happened intra-quarter was even more confounding because as you go sort of get through more deeper and deeper into winter, we see the business slows down just seasonally and this year exactly opposite happened. So what\u2019s the reason? Just from a pure math perspective, as I said, both move-ins and move-outs are better, but obviously, we\u2019re not projecting that in the future, but we\u2019ll see how it plays out as we get through the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. So I guess a question for John and the optimizational -- optimization process that you\u2019re going through with Senior Housing. A lot of it is sort of, it\u2019s very interesting and believable, the work that you\u2019re putting into it, but yet to be sort of quantified. And I\u2019m curious if very soon or in some reasonable period of time that we might see sort of this optimization line -- a new line item on your slide, page 19, where you\u2019re bringing some of the work into real dollars and cents in terms of the effort, because right now, it\u2019s not really something you can model. And I wonder if that would be more in the way of expense savings, which I would expect or maybe there\u2019d be less frictional vacancy. So it would impact the revenue side. I\u2019m just curious if you could sort of triangulate it all, putting some quantified numbers into your effort or when that might come for all of us to look at?\nJohn Burkart: Great question. I -- as you know, I tend to avoid a lot of details, because everyone tends to copy things and it\u2019s better to execute. I think what you\u2019re seeing in our numbers, there\u2019s real numbers coming through. So it\u2019s not just discussing it. You\u2019re seeing it in the output. But I do appreciate you want to get some more specifics. You mentioned frictional vacancy. We\u2019re nowhere close to that right now. The opportunity to just literally increase vacancy without worry to -- worry or concern about frictional vacancy is there all day long and so there is really both. There\u2019s some level of opportunities on the expenses, but that really relates to productivity, because again, as I say it over and over, our focus is on improving the customer experience, not about trying to cut anything. So to the extent there\u2019s some productivity opportunities there, which the platform is focused at, in the sense of I mentioned last time, sometimes it takes hours to move someone in because of the paperwork and having a unified platform will solve for that and eliminate that wasted time, enabling our staff to spend more time with the with the customers. A lot of the opportunity, though, really is focused on the revenue side, whether it be increasing occupancy, because we\u2019re just simply out executing. Frankly, we\u2019re answering the phones and delivering that that quality customer experience that\u2019s driving occupancy or because we\u2019re changing the value proposition and the market says this is worth more. Hopefully that helps.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. Yeah. Maybe a question for Tim on the balance sheet. If we look at substantial amount of cash at the end of the quarter and then the outline to have another $1 billion of asset sales and guidance, it just seems like, relative to the acquisitions you\u2019ve announced so far that you\u2019re sitting in like a significant excess cash situation. So maybe you could just give us a feel for how you think about that. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any planned debt repayments or anything else we should be thinking about there?\nTim McHugh: Yeah. Thanks, Nick. So you\u2019re correct on the excess debt side or excess cash side. I will highlight that, as you indicated in the past, we have $1.35 billion unsecured maturities here in the first quarter. So $450 million of which matured in January and we paid off and the remainder will be paid off in March. So that\u2019s one component of the uses and I think what you\u2019re hearing from the rest of our team today is a lot of optimism around opportunities to put cash to work. So I think the balance sheet is very well positioned for that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Can you speak to the share gains you might be seeing in Senior Housing versus the local competitors that when you look at that 230 basis points of expansion this year?\nShankh Mitra: Wes, I missed the first part of your question. Can you please repeat the question and get closer to your phone?\nWes Golladay: Yeah. Okay. Sorry, can you hear me now okay?\nShankh Mitra: Yeah.\nWes Golladay: Yeah. Can you speak to the share? Yeah. Can you speak to the share gains you might be seeing in the Senior Housing versus the local competitors set, you did mention the 230 basis points this year, which is a record year?\nShankh Mitra: Yeah. So, look, we have a very large portfolio, it\u2019s hard to speak in generalities, and obviously, across three countries. But if you look at all of the industry data that you will see, our portfolio has meaningfully outperformed both in rate growth, as well as occupancy growth. But what\u2019s new about that? But you can probably look at the data and others kind of decide that might get to that point. But as I said, we don\u2019t know what the future will give us. Our -- what we endeavor, what I promise to you that will put 200% effort to outperform the market and that\u2019s what we are trying to do. And so far, what I\u2019ve seen, I mean, John mentioned a stat that, if we do achieve our NOI growth guidance in the shop portfolio this year, there\u2019s no guarantee we will. But if we do, that\u2019ll be 75% compounded growth over three years. There is -- I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any precedence of that in a large broad sort of a portfolio. So we are meaningfully performing the market and that gap is widening and I think it will continue to widen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning. Just a question on pricing trends for new customers. One, how is that evolved through the fourth quarter? Just to think about that relative to occupancy. And I guess the second part would be, you mentioned the operating leverage changes as occupancy improves and you\u2019re fully staffed. So how should we think about -- how are you thinking about the tradeoff between occupancy and price going into the rest of 2024 and into 2025?\nShankh Mitra: Let me try to answer that question. So fourth quarter, if you look at, I\u2019m actually pretty very pleased with pricing trends. As you know, that we have a lot of the portfolio sort of radically turned through the year, right. So we have -- and so if you just look at the Sunrise situation that I talked about, RevPOR growth was up 6.8%. That\u2019s a very, very strong number and with that kind of occupancy growth, you don\u2019t expect that kind of numbers. But put that aside. Let\u2019s just think about what next year\u2019s look like and we passed the Jan 1. A lot of operators in Jan 1, a lot of operators\u2019 sort of have moved from Jan 1 to the February 1. I think I talked about that two years ago. Just not -- just the after holidays sort of moved a little bit out of that. So just generally speaking, talk about the half of the portfolio that sort of rolling in the Q1 specifically rather than just talking Jan 1, I would say existing customer rent increases has been relatively in the same ballpark of last year, but probably 100 basis points to 150 basis points lower. This generally feels right around that level. So, if it was 10 last year, it\u2019s 9 this year, something like that. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t hold me specific. Some operators have done more than 10 last year. I\u2019m saying generally speaking, in that range of probably 100 basis points, 150 basis points lower. And we will see what the rest of the portfolio does as we go through the year. There\u2019s also remember RevPOR is not just a function of ECRI, our existing customer rent increases, but it\u2019s also a function of sort of market rent, right? What that your mark-to-market and we will see, we don\u2019t know? Usually speaking, market rent are lower in Q1 and sort of goes up from the summer months and we\u2019ll see how this all plays out. There\u2019s a math aside. We feel that the second part of your question, which is a brilliant question, sort of thinking about in this kind of occupancy, just call it mid-80s occupancy. What is that sort of efficient frontier pricing versus occupancy? That question is hard to answer on a conference call, but I will tell you what you are going after is a very important one, because how operating leverage, because of operating leverage, how your incremental margins work. While it is in the late 70s, early 80s, it is obvious that you should go after the rate, not the occupancy, that may not be true in the mid-80s where your optimized level could be some occupancy, some rates. We\u2019ll see how this plays out, but we are -- we think it\u2019s our guests as we sit here today and nothing but a guest that will be largely in the same ballpark of close to double-digit revenue growth that we have seen last year.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey. I just want to sort of close the thought on the occupancy just because of sequential sort of improvement, as well as the guidance acceleration. Coming out of the different way, is this -- like how much of this should we think of as an industry wide phenomenon where we should expect other operators to see occupancy accelerate versus sort of John\u2019s operating platform, creating that Alpha is sort of part one. Part two would be when you think about that occupancy recovery slide in your deck, are we at the point where we should start thinking about 91% as the new target versus for the 88%, because based on the guidance, you\u2019re going to be at 85% at the end of the year. Just trying to get a sense of how much conviction and growing conviction you have and getting back to that peak occupancy level? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Well, let me try to answer that question. The second part is an easier one. If all we do is we end up at 91% occupancy, which is sort of 2015 achieved, then we frankly speaking, we didn\u2019t add a lot of value. Because if you think about it, I don\u2019t know, just pick a number, two years, three years, whatever your number of years is, demand-supply, I think, you understand, starts to get materially better starting 2025, 2026, right, sort of. And the delivery schedule, if you look at it, you know what the stocks are, which is not much, right? You can see the demand-supply imbalance gets really interesting next year and the year after, right? So at least we can say that, because we don\u2019t know, if there\u2019s other people that without our knowledge is building. It\u2019s unlikely, but we don\u2019t know. But at least we can sort of see next two years with a reasonable clarity and we don\u2019t believe that friction vacancy of this business is 9%, right? John is that it?\nJohn Burkart: It\u2019s absolutely not. It\u2019s a financial calculation and it is not 9%. It is substantially less. So that that\u2019s just not an option.\nShankh Mitra: So do we believe that we\u2019ll end up at 91%? I\u2019ll be very disappointed if that\u2019s the case, but we shall see what the market gives us. What was the first part of your question, Ron, that I missed?\nRonald Kamdem: Sure. It was just so we expect every operator to see occupancy reaccelerate 2024\u2026\nShankh Mitra: Oh! Yeah. Yeah.\nRonald Kamdem: \u2026 or what are you guys doing that\u2019s different?\nShankh Mitra: Yeah. So, look, I can\u2019t speak for others, right, clearly, right? What do I know about others? My promise to you and our fellow shareholders have always been that we will put 100% effort to outperform the market. So far, we have done it, right? I don\u2019t think Q4 numbers will be much different and I think our hope will be that we will continue to do so. My confidence in our ability to outperform the average of the industry is widening. I think that gap is widening and my confidence is increasing. But we still have to -- this is February 14th. We have to see what the year gives us.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This will conclude the Welltower fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you all for joining us today. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "I'll go next. Yeah. Thanks, John. On the transaction side, as Shankh mentioned, 2023 marked the most active year in the history of the company. Our new investment activity of almost $6 billion spanned more than 50 different transactions with a median transaction size of $54 million, in which we acquired 153 properties over the course of the year. I am sure you all have read about the confluence of a few factors that are creating the current investment backdrop, namely the great wall of CRE debt maturity, expiring SOFR caps, pressure on the regional bank balance sheet and the denominator effect. Welltower is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends and serve as a counterparty of choice for our private equity sponsors, large pension and asset managers, and entrepreneurs that are impacted by this challenge. We are able to source these opportunities directly from sellers or through our operating partners, given our reputation of being a good partner and a reliable and credible counterparty. We are then able to analyze and underwrite quickly and in great detail, thanks to the combination of our data analytics platform, Alpha, and our best in business investment team. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we then execute on the business plan for each asset through our deep network of aligned operating partners backed by the operating platform that John is methodically building out. These factors drive our sustainable competitive advantage for creating shareholder value. Our 2023 investment activity was focused on granular, off-market, high conviction transactions. A majority of the transactions were focused on our seniors and wellness housing businesses, where we acquired additional assets and markets where we already have high performing assets. By acquiring these assets at an attractive basis and consolidating operations under the same operator, we are able to reap the operating benefits of regional density. In the fourth quarter alone, we closed on nearly $3 billion of investments while remaining targeted and disciplined. We acquired 44 Senior Housing properties from 11 different sellers, growing our relationship with seven existing operating partners. We acquired roughly 8,800 units with an average age of around seven years at an average basis of $222,000 per unit at an approximately 40% discount to replacement costs. These transactions have a low 6s year one yield and are expected to generate unlevered IRRs north of 10%. I am also excited to provide an update on the performance of our Integra portfolio, where we have continued to see a sequential improvement in performance. For the 140 buildings that first transitioned to regional operators, we have seen annualized EBITDARM improve by more than $300 million, from losing more than $85 million in the three months prior to the transition to positive $228 million in the third quarter. While there continues to be meaningful remaining upside in performance beyond the current state, I am pleased to announce that EBITDARM coverage is now greater than one and a half times. We also transitioned the last seven remaining buildings earlier this month after getting the final set of regulatory approvals. On the back of our continued success turning around operations for our legacy Genesis and ProMedica skilled nursing portfolios, we have take -- we were active in deploying capital in the skilled space as we partnered with regional operators to acquire under managed assets. Given the credit nature of our skilled nursing investments, we always strive to have meaningful downside protection through a combination of right per bed basis in states with favorable reimbursement landscape and significant credit protection through personal and entity level guarantees. Looking ahead to 2024, we are off to an exciting start. We are delighted to announce our strategic partnership with Affinity Living Communities in which we are entering into a long-term programmatic development relationship and acquiring the Affinity portfolio of 25 active adult properties with an average age of less than eight years for $969 million or $233,000 per unit after allocating the NPV of interest cost savings to the assumed below market debt. Darin, Scott, Charlie, and John have built a fantastic business over the last decade as they have meticulously iterated and refined the Affinity prototype. Their vertically integrated platform and unwavering focus on efficiency has enabled them to grow their footprint in typically expensive Pacific Northwest markets at an attractive basis to provide moderately priced active adult housing at average rents of approximately $2,100 per month. We have been incredibly pleased with the operating performance of our moderately priced active adult business over the last few years and are excited to partner with the Affinity team to further grow that business. Our investment team remains incredibly busy as we continue to be the steady hand and trusted counterparty in our business and remain well-positioned to capitalize on capital structure issues across the industry. We are inundated with opportunities up and down the capital stack and continue to balance price discipline, operator selection and capital availability to be thoughtful stewards of our shareholder's capital. I will now hand over the call to Tim to walk through our financial results in 2024. Let me answer that question. That was the development question. We -- Nick, we put out a page eight in our slide decks that could be informative for some thinking about this question. If you think about there are some interesting things to think through. One, let's just talk about things that we all know. Cost of construction is up significantly. Cost of capital, you just think about it, a Senior Housing development loan today, if you can get one, good luck with that, even we struggling to get one, if we need one, is at 350, 400 over. So, you're talking about your debt cost-to-capital in the ninth and the 10th, right? No, we haven't seen a development pro forma that works. That's sort of a financial aspect you guys know, then obviously think through what it takes to an average, I'm not talking middle of Manhattan, West LA, west side of Boston, places like that. An average Welltower location in a very wealthy micro market in East Coast, West Coast or locations like that probably takes two years to three years of redevelopment and you know that it takes a couple of years of construction after that. But what is more interesting that we have noticed is last 12 months to 18 months, that a lot of the changes that happened because of what I just described to you, in the platforms that have developed most of the Senior Housing assets, they have been dismantled. So if you look at page eight, we have added something for you to sort of ponder over is the first thing that needs to happen if people can find money and they think it's a good thing to do is to first build back the human capital side before you think about the financial capital side. The last thing I will leave you with to think about, my understanding is developers build or develop product to sell at a profit. When majority of the product traded in last three years at $0.70 on the $1, what confidence do you have that when you build a product for $1 that you will get a $1.30? I don't think the confidence would be very high on the equity side, and obviously, you'll take out financing when there is no acquisition financing, because that rollover we just described in the previous one, we think development in any meaningful way is years away. But again, as I said, we don't know the future. That's what seems logical. We'll see what the future plays out."

            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. Although most of my time at Welltower has spent doing the Welltower hustle, getting up every day, identifying and aggressively pursuing the opportunities that exist, focused on improving the customer and employee experience. I want to take a moment and reflect on how proud I am of the Welltower team for success in doing just that, improving the customer and employee experience, which in part is reflected by our performance. Focusing on Senior Housing for a moment, the Welltower team consists of our top operators and all of their employees, our key vendors, as well as the Welltower employees. We have all worked together to improve the customer and employee experience, which has resulted in fantastic results. On top of the industry-leading Senior Housing same-store NOI growth for the full year of 2022 of 20.1%, our full year 2023 Senior Housing NOI growth was 24.4%. Often on earnings calls, you hear the words, tough cost. That's certainly true here. Yet our guidance for 2024 same-store Senior Housing NOI growth at the midpoint is 18%. Therefore, based on our two full years that are completed and in the record books, 2022 and 2023, and our guidance of 18% in 2024, that indicates that the three-year compounded growth of our same-store Senior Housing NOI in 2024 will be over 75%. That's something to reflect upon. Thank you, Welltower team. Now back to our business. Our portfolio generated 12.5% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, led by the Senior Housing Operating portfolio with 23.7% year-over-year growth. The Outpatient Medical portfolio produced same-store portfolio growth of 2.8% for the fourth quarter of 2023. This was driven by favorable operating expense management, increasing the operating margin by 220 basis points year-over-year to 71.4%. Notably, our proactive appeal process achieved favorable real estate tax reductions. The 23.7% fourth quarter year-over-year NOI increased in our same-store Housing Operating portfolio with a function of 9.7% revenue growth, driven by the combination of 5.5% RevPOR growth and 330 basis points of average occupancy gain and moderating expense growth. Expenses remain in control, coming in at 5.7% for the quarter over the prior year's quarter. The strong revenue growth and expense control led to continued margin expansion of 290 basis points. Again, our ExpPOR growth for the quarter set a record for the lowest growth in our recorded history at 1.7%. All three regions continue to show strong same-store revenue growth, starting with the U.S. at 9.4%, Canada and the U.K. growing at 9.7% and 14.1%, respectively. The strong revenue growth in each region, combined with the expense control, have led to fantastic NOI growth in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. of 21.8%, 21.7% and 75.5%, respectively. We're flying along with our integrated platform initiative, which will start to go live at our first operator in the first half of this year. I will not go into all the details, but I will say that our focus on improving the customer and employee experience is coming together very well. The integrations of the various modules will simplify the customer experience and reduce the labor around basic tasks, enabling our site teams to focus on what they love, our customers. More to come in 2024. I will now turn the call over to Tim. Yeah. So on the -- how the numbers work, as Shankh and Tim has said for a long time, the flow through gets pretty fantastic as you get north of 80%. So when you talk about staffing up, you really have, and I mentioned this on the last call, the positions are in place. You have your head chef, you have your executive director, et cetera, et cetera. So it's very incremental. So this arc of the curve, there's a lot of money that comes to the bottomline as you increase occupancy. And additionally, as we've said, because of supply-demand factors, that's just expected in the marketplace. We may or may not decide to spend more money on marketing to accelerate that, but the conditions are fantastic right now. Yeah. Thanks, Tayo. Obviously, we're very aware of the conversations taking place on the regulatory side. I think something that's consistent with how we've talked about this in the past is, this business, the Senior Housing side, we almost entirely play in a private pay business where the delivery of a high quality product and reputation in the market is the most important driver of your business on a go-forward basis. And so, I think, there's areas of the healthcare world where that's not the same and you've got more of a captive demand audience and there's more concern over how you may run a business. But on the Senior Housing side, what we know very well, both the good and the bad, is that the business is entirely driven by reputation. So, it continues to be the focus of ours is that, whether it's the staffing levels, the level of care, the quality of the employees, they are what drives the business day in, day out and it's why we spend so much time focusing on creating these sustainable models for property level. Yeah. Good question. And what I am seeing is a little bit longer stays. As far as for the details of that, I don't have that specific information, I can look to see if I can get it and get it back to you offline. Great question. I -- as you know, I tend to avoid a lot of details, because everyone tends to copy things and it's better to execute. I think what you're seeing in our numbers, there's real numbers coming through. So it's not just discussing it. You're seeing it in the output. But I do appreciate you want to get some more specifics. You mentioned frictional vacancy. We're nowhere close to that right now. The opportunity to just literally increase vacancy without worry to -- worry or concern about frictional vacancy is there all day long and so there is really both. There's some level of opportunities on the expenses, but that really relates to productivity, because again, as I say it over and over, our focus is on improving the customer experience, not about trying to cut anything. So to the extent there's some productivity opportunities there, which the platform is focused at, in the sense of I mentioned last time, sometimes it takes hours to move someone in because of the paperwork and having a unified platform will solve for that and eliminate that wasted time, enabling our staff to spend more time with the with the customers. A lot of the opportunity, though, really is focused on the revenue side, whether it be increasing occupancy, because we're just simply out executing. Frankly, we're answering the phones and delivering that that quality customer experience that's driving occupancy or because we're changing the value proposition and the market says this is worth more. Hopefully that helps. It's absolutely not. It's a financial calculation and it is not 9%. It is substantially less. So that that's just not an option."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and describe high level business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the operational performance of our Senior Housing and Outpatient Medical portfolios and progress on our operating platform build-out. Nikhil will give you an update on the investment landscape. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and 2024 full year guidance. First, as I reflect back on 2023, it was a year of solid execution across the Board with significant progress achieved in all aspects of the business. Operating performance far surpassed our initial expectations. We had a great year, a record-setting year in terms of capital deployment and we meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity profile. Just as importantly, perhaps, is the groundwork we laid to sustain this level of performance and continue to deliver outsized growth not only in 2024 but also well into the future. This includes the considerable progress John and his team have made on the build-out of our operating platform, which we continue to believe will transform the industry. On top of that, as we have discussed in recent quarters, we have executed a number of operator transitions across all our geographies, as well as converted a handful of properties from triple-net to RIDEA. All should bear fruit later this year and in 2025. We finished the year strong with significant momentum to set us up for another year of solid performance in 2024. In terms of our Senior Housing Operating portfolio, I was particularly encouraged by the occupancy growth in fourth quarter, which is seasonally not the strongest period. The portfolio saw 110 basis points of sequential occupancy gains, which translate into 330 basis points year-over-year occupancy growth, and the 330 basis points year-over-year occupancy growth is by far the highest level we have ever achieved in the fourth quarter of any year in our recorded history. Just as compelling is that looking at the intra-quarter trends, year-over-year occupancy growth strengthened each month, which is unusual given the aforementioned seasonality of the business. We're also pleased with the rate growth achieved by our managers. During our last call, I described to you that one of our largest operators, Sunrise, pulled forward Jan 1, 2023 rate increases into 4Q 2022. This year they have returned to their historical cadence of Jan 1 rate increases. While this distorts our show portfolio's reported Q4 2023 RevPOR or the unit revenue, the rest of the portfolio delivered RevPOR growth of 6.8%, reflecting the underlying fundamental strength of the business. While our 2024 guidance assumes some diminution of RevPOR growth from full year of 2023 levels of 6.6%, we still expect another year of near double-digit topline growth as occupancy continues to build at a solid pace. 4Q 2023, same-store ExpPOR or expense per occupied room grew 1.7% year-over-year. The lowest level of growth in Welltower's recorded history, driven by 4Q 2023 same-store compensation per occupied room growth, which grew 1.9% year-over-year, also the lowest growth in Welltower's recorded history. While the normalization of agency labor usage is helping to dampen COMPOR growth, we are also seeing some good trends in the salary and the wages line. All of these trends are resulting in a favorable spread between RevPOR growth and ExpPOR growth. The powerful combination of this revenue backdrop with continued margin expansion that should be expected due to the high operating leverage inherent in the business leaves us feeling very strongly about our 2024 NOI growth setup. Tim will give you our detailed buildup of our NOI guidance based on our current assumptions, but please understand that we have no false pretense about perfectly knowing what the business will look like as we move through the years, particularly the all-important summer months. But we are optimistic, given the demand-supply backdrop, which improves by the day and the rising system-wide occupancy, as well as the early success we have seen in John's operating platform buildout. While 24.4% NOI growth last year for our shop portfolio alone was very encouraging, I'm extremely pleased with our capital allocation activities as well. In 2023 was the most active year in our history in terms of raising and deploying capital. We completed almost $6 billion of investments in the year, nearly half of which closed in Q4 alone. While I won't get into the specific transactions, I will mention that they share some common characteristics. First, we generally grew with our existing operating partners in their respective markets. Second, we acquired assets at a significant discount to replacement costs from core funds, PE funds, pension funds and financial institutions who were seeking liquidity. We also added a couple of new operating partners along the way who I envision us growing with in the near-term. More to come on this topic as we progress through the year. The torrid pace of investment activity in Q4 has continued with 2024 starting off with a bang. In fact, I do not recall having ever been this busy in first quarter on the deal front. While we have pre-negotiated documents and structure to leverage, it is great trust that we have built with our 2023 counterparties that will make follow-on transactions easier to execute. These counterparties also experienced what our promise always is, that we honor our handshake irrespective of circumstances, as evidenced by the continued -- our continued execution through this historic capital market volatility in the fall and winter of 2023. They know that we remain the clean shirt in an industry where re-trading counterparties is the norm. It is interesting and perhaps coincidental that we're experiencing another bout of market volatility after a few weeks have come. Over the past few weeks, another regional banking crisis driven by U.S. CRE debt appears to be rearing its ugly head from New York to Tokyo to Germany. We are currently staring at approximately $16 billion of Senior Housing loans maturing in the next 24 months in the U.S., which dwarfs roughly about a couple of billion dollars of agency financing completed in 2023. This should generate significant equity, as well as private credit opportunity for us. Suffice to say, our near-term capital deployment pipeline remains robust, highly visible and actionable, and with -- and squarely within our circle of competence, where we can bet with house odds rather than gambler's odds. Along with what we have already done in 2023, these acquisitions that carry an attractive basis, operational upside and significant value-add from Welltower's operating platform, we have a -- we will have a meaningful impact on what remains a true North Star, long-term compounding of partial value of our existing short loans. With that, I will hand the call over to John. John? Thank you, Tim. I wanted to address a few important topics before I open the call up for questions. As you may know, on November 28th, we lost my personal hero, mentor and friend, Charlie Munger. We're deeply saddened by his death and thank many of you for reaching out to my team and me during this difficult time. Charlie was truly generous with his wisdom, continually guiding us not only on the importance of compounding, but also behaving like owners, not managers and deserving great partners by being one, and taking far less crowded high road and acting with conviction when the conditions were right. We witnessed his wit, uncommon sense, simplicity, passion for multidisciplinary running and innate ability to cut through noise and arrive at the right decision. The influence he had on Welltower, its people and its culture is truly immeasurable. His serene guidance and sage, principled advice has been invaluable to me in my life and my career. Charlie was also an instrumental influence on the members of our senior leadership team to whom he gave his greatest gift of all time, his time. We're grateful for the time we spent in his presence. I owe him a lifetime debt that cannot be repaid, but we will carry forward his teachings in how we deal with our owners, partners, residents, employees and others. His most profound impact on us is perhaps cemented in the ground rule document that he guided me to write that you can find on our website. Moving on to a less somber topic, I want to draw your attention to some of the partners which we forged new relationship with in 2023. Beyond what we have announced so far, I want to highlight Affinity as our new growth partner. Nikhil walked you through the investment rational Affinity, but I would also like to express how excited I am to work with Darin Davidson and his team there. As we have gotten to know Darin over the last five years, he has proven to be a man of high integrity and thoughtfulness with a true compass on the future direction of how older Americans want to live. Despite adding a few handful of managers to our growth platform in 2023, our partner and geographic strategy remains to go deep instead of going broad and our consolidating roster of existing managers reflect that. In summary, I hope that the optimism conveyed by my partners today on growth prospect of our business has resonated with you. While we remain focused on the execution of our 2024 strategic and operational goals, I cannot help but draw your attention to the outsized multiyear growth trajectory in front of us, which is supported by five different growth pillars. Number one, some of it is questionably is a function of favorable demand supply setup that I think you all understand. This should only get better as we look into 2025 and 2026. Number two, a lot of my personal enthusiasm stems from the digital transformation and business process optimization that John is driving. We should start to see some fruits of his labor this year, but much more in 2025 and 2026. Number three, overlay that with the impact of hundreds of properties that we have recently transitioned or agreed to transition to better operators. I am excited about the improving resident and employee experience that is currently underway with a financial impact following soon thereafter. Number four, add our extremely targeted and disciplined growth, external growth opportunities. And last but not least, number five, our underleveraged balance sheet that which Tim just described to you. We will continue to experience further organic deleveraging, which will either support A rating or provide capacity for additional external growth. As we think about the next couple of years, we have never felt better about the growth prospects or accelerating growth prospects of our earnings and cash flow for our company on a partial basis. With that, I will open the call up for questions. You snuck in three questions. Let me see if I can understand or remember all of them. First is we laid out our strategy of how we see investing in the senior living space, which is high price point, very affluent micro market, high acuity product, if you will, where we provide a service that can be actually charged accordingly and hire people and pay them appropriately. So that's one strategy. On the other side of the barbell, we went from no acuity and build out a business over the last eight -- six years, five years, six years on this wellness housing side, where it's much lower price point, but almost no services. So it's sort of from an acuity standpoint and that provides obviously much higher NOI margin. That's the two business segment that we know how to do well and make money and that's where we are. I'm not suggesting that anything in between is not something that is right or wrong or anything like that, but just not something that we're focused on. Going back to your question, where that 60% or so margin sits in that wellness housing spectrum, I will say it sits towards the upper end, probably, the upper half, but no means and aberration, right? So you think about, I think about this business from mostly a mid-50%s to mid-60% margin business. Your last question, how has the growth has been in the wellness housing? Historically, it has been growing, I would say, mid-to-high single-digit. In 2023, the NOI growth for our wellness housing portfolio on a same-store basis has been 12.2%. In fourth quarter alone, that was 13.1%. Hope I remember all your questions. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. I'll start probably with one of my favorite mongerisms, which is knowing what you don't know is actually a lot more useful than being brilliant. So I want to make sure you understand that, we have no hubris of what we don't know. So I'm, frankly speaking, I'm pretty surprised, for many months, I've been reading about this in research reports, talking to investors, that sort of this idea that if you had three -- two good years of numbers, obviously, that has to go down pretty meaningfully. Frankly speaking, I don't personally understand that. I will tell you that we don't know how this year is going to completely play out. We give you our best guess that Tim described to you. It is possible that we have another year of that growth rate that's sort of similar to last two years, possible if we have a strong summer sort of leasing season, right? But I think we're going to have many great years in front of us with double-digit NOI growth. Now, with -- whether this year, next year, this quarter, next quarter, I don't know what chips will fall, but as we think about taking this portfolio to where it should be leased with our opinion, as we have told you, that we'll be very disappointed if we go back to pre-COVID. There is no reason we can't even go back to where 2015 levels were, because if you look forward next few years, you will see demand-supply has been significantly better and our platform build out should help us get well past that. We should have double-digit NOI growth for years to come. I hope that sort of answers your question. We have no hubris of sort of knowing what we don't know. But we think it's also this idea that, because our business has done so well for last two years, it has to go down, it has to meaningfully decelerate, it sorts of reminds me that, perhaps, we should have more humility of what we don't know. We'll see how this plays out. We'll see what market gives us. Thank you. Jonathan, let me see if I can answer that question. We will not give guidance. Our shop is not designed to buy stuff. We only grow if we think we can grow to add value on a partial basis for existing investors. So, if that means it's $3 billion, it's $3 billion. That means it's $300 million, it's $300 million and that means if it's $8 billion, it's $8 billion. That's sort of where we are. Having said that, if you look at the page seven of our slide deck, we see there's a massive amount of loans in the Senior Housing space that are rolling. That's just a U.S. number. We're also seeing opportunities in both the U.K. and Canada, similar ideas and there is not enough credit in the system to reify this. So we think the opportunity set, obviously, in front of us is going to be very robust. Speaking of pipeline right now, I want to reiterate the comment that I have made in my prepared remarks. We have never been this busy in Q1. As you understand, there is a seasonality of the deal business as well, right? People work really, really hard into the year end to close out the year and Q1 is usually very, sort of, you don't see a lot of activity, activity starts to pick up, obviously, in Q2 and then that's obviously translated into heavy second half. And that normal seasonality, we haven't seen, and perhaps, because of the debt curve that we're talking about, perhaps, it's because of another thing that Nikhil mentioned, which is the interest caps that are coming up and regional banks were nowhere to be found, right? So, in that context, I think, we're going to have a record year again. But who knows? If we don't see the opportunities to invest, we won't. But the pipeline remains robust, it's visible, it's actionable and we can see massive amount of value creation coming through that. Tayo? Tayo, we can hear you. Hello? Tayo, we can hear you. That -- I believe that the Senior Housing loan situation we're talking about is the traditional Senior Housing product. You can, for some lender, can sort of define this as multifamily, some can Senior Housing. So, there's no way to specifically know. We play into the mid-market segment of that active adult, the wellness housing segment. You think about there are four large players in that space that we know of is that there are others, but the four major ones that we know of, Clover, Calamar, Sparrow and Affinity, and all four of them are existing Welltower partners today. As I have mentioned before, I believe in going deep, not going broad. If we find more opportunities, we will obviously see how that stacks up against our growth potentials, et cetera, but we are definitely focused on growing our business. And I think you would say starting this business six years ago to about 25,000 units today, we're doing a pretty good job of it. But growth for growth's sake is something that I just can't get my head around. Our job is to create long-term shareholder value, compounding on a partial basis what we're after. So, we'll see if we can do it, but I will be optimistic that wellness housing over a period of time will become a very significant portion of Welltower portfolio. Yeah. Austin, I just want to make sure I understand your question. A lot of opportunity that we are seeing are driven by current existing owners' credit situation, whether that's rate caps, whether that's LTV, whether that's DSCR, whether that's refi. So it's driven by credit situations on their end. How we execute that on our end could be credit or could be equity and vast majority of what we have done is equity opportunities. But we are interested in the private credit side as an equity owner. I've said this many, many times that we're just not lenders. We are owner of those properties at the last dollar basis where we're credit stands, right. So that's how we think about it. In other words, that we're very comfortable taking back the keys if the buyer decides to -- the owner decides to do so. However, vast majority of our execution on our end is on the equity side, though we remain very interested for the right opportunities on the -- in the -- to play in the credit stack. However, I will tell you, we never loan against assets at a last dollar value at a given location for a product that we do not want to own. That is not what we do. So that's something that's very interesting for you to sort of think through. Yeah. I think from a competition perspective, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, most of the transactions -- all of the transactions that we've executed on, they have been privately negotiated directly with the sellers. So it's not that we're participating in auctions or anything like that and a big part of that is there is really no liquidity in the market. So we're not seeing any competition really. And then, I think, remind me again, what was your second question? Yeah. Yeah. Mike, so my question, my answer to Nick's question was focused on Senior Housing development, as in what do you understand as a regular Senior Housing product. Affinity or wellness housing, these are apartments, right? These are not where care gets delivered. So that -- these are housing products. These are rental housing products. How can it be? I'll tell you, probably if you think about it, Nikhil said, average age is eight years. The portfolio size is 25. So just call it three, four starts a year, something like that would be something that I would expect. But we don't know, it depends on where the product is year-over-year. What the current pipeline is. But something like that can be expected over time. John, I'll just add that if you look at the coming out of the pandemic, average age and acuity went up right just coming out of the pandemic and sort of first three months, six months, something like that month where we've seen the acuity has gone up and the average age has gone up. As we sort of things have normalized, I will say we're hearing more and more comments from our operating partners that average age is coming down and length of stay because of that acuity is coming down, but length of stay is going up because of that. So, Mike, let me try to answer that question. I was just looking at this a couple of days ago. Interestingly, as we looked at the fourth quarter data is, obviously, we're talking about the context sort of seasonal trends that we have seen in fourth quarter, specifically looking at that, both move-ins and move-outs were better. So we have seen better move-in rates, move-in trends, and we have seen better move-out trends. So that sort of both created this unusual seasonal pattern. As you have noted, not only the quarter was kind of interesting, or frankly, confounding in a positive way from a seasonality standpoint, but what happened intra-quarter was even more confounding because as you go sort of get through more deeper and deeper into winter, we see the business slows down just seasonally and this year exactly opposite happened. So what's the reason? Just from a pure math perspective, as I said, both move-ins and move-outs are better, but obviously, we're not projecting that in the future, but we'll see how it plays out as we get through the year. Wes, I missed the first part of your question. Can you please repeat the question and get closer to your phone? Yeah. Yeah. So, look, we have a very large portfolio, it's hard to speak in generalities, and obviously, across three countries. But if you look at all of the industry data that you will see, our portfolio has meaningfully outperformed both in rate growth, as well as occupancy growth. But what's new about that? But you can probably look at the data and others kind of decide that might get to that point. But as I said, we don't know what the future will give us. Our -- what we endeavor, what I promise to you that will put 200% effort to outperform the market and that's what we are trying to do. And so far, what I've seen, I mean, John mentioned a stat that, if we do achieve our NOI growth guidance in the shop portfolio this year, there's no guarantee we will. But if we do, that'll be 75% compounded growth over three years. There is -- I don't believe there's any precedence of that in a large broad sort of a portfolio. So we are meaningfully performing the market and that gap is widening and I think it will continue to widen. Let me try to answer that question. So fourth quarter, if you look at, I'm actually pretty very pleased with pricing trends. As you know, that we have a lot of the portfolio sort of radically turned through the year, right. So we have -- and so if you just look at the Sunrise situation that I talked about, RevPOR growth was up 6.8%. That's a very, very strong number and with that kind of occupancy growth, you don't expect that kind of numbers. But put that aside. Let's just think about what next year's look like and we passed the Jan 1. A lot of operators in Jan 1, a lot of operators' sort of have moved from Jan 1 to the February 1. I think I talked about that two years ago. Just not -- just the after holidays sort of moved a little bit out of that. So just generally speaking, talk about the half of the portfolio that sort of rolling in the Q1 specifically rather than just talking Jan 1, I would say existing customer rent increases has been relatively in the same ballpark of last year, but probably 100 basis points to 150 basis points lower. This generally feels right around that level. So, if it was 10 last year, it's 9 this year, something like that. I'm not saying don't hold me specific. Some operators have done more than 10 last year. I'm saying generally speaking, in that range of probably 100 basis points, 150 basis points lower. And we will see what the rest of the portfolio does as we go through the year. There's also remember RevPOR is not just a function of ECRI, our existing customer rent increases, but it's also a function of sort of market rent, right? What that your mark-to-market and we will see, we don't know? Usually speaking, market rent are lower in Q1 and sort of goes up from the summer months and we'll see how this all plays out. There's a math aside. We feel that the second part of your question, which is a brilliant question, sort of thinking about in this kind of occupancy, just call it mid-80s occupancy. What is that sort of efficient frontier pricing versus occupancy? That question is hard to answer on a conference call, but I will tell you what you are going after is a very important one, because how operating leverage, because of operating leverage, how your incremental margins work. While it is in the late 70s, early 80s, it is obvious that you should go after the rate, not the occupancy, that may not be true in the mid-80s where your optimized level could be some occupancy, some rates. We'll see how this plays out, but we are -- we think it's our guests as we sit here today and nothing but a guest that will be largely in the same ballpark of close to double-digit revenue growth that we have seen last year. Well, let me try to answer that question. The second part is an easier one. If all we do is we end up at 91% occupancy, which is sort of 2015 achieved, then we frankly speaking, we didn't add a lot of value. Because if you think about it, I don't know, just pick a number, two years, three years, whatever your number of years is, demand-supply, I think, you understand, starts to get materially better starting 2025, 2026, right, sort of. And the delivery schedule, if you look at it, you know what the stocks are, which is not much, right? You can see the demand-supply imbalance gets really interesting next year and the year after, right? So at least we can say that, because we don't know, if there's other people that without our knowledge is building. It's unlikely, but we don't know. But at least we can sort of see next two years with a reasonable clarity and we don't believe that friction vacancy of this business is 9%, right? John is that it? So do we believe that we'll end up at 91%? I'll be very disappointed if that's the case, but we shall see what the market gives us. What was the first part of your question, Ron, that I missed? Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, look, I can't speak for others, right, clearly, right? What do I know about others? My promise to you and our fellow shareholders have always been that we will put 100% effort to outperform the market. So far, we have done it, right? I don't think Q4 numbers will be much different and I think our hope will be that we will continue to do so. My confidence in our ability to outperform the average of the industry is widening. I think that gap is widening and my confidence is increasing. But we still have to -- this is February 14th. We have to see what the year gives us."

            "name": "Tim McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, performance of our triple-net investment segments, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update, and finally, the introduction of our full year 2024 outlook. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.15 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.96 per diluted share, representing 15.7% year-over-year growth. We also reported total portfolio, same-store NOI growth of 12.5% year-over-year. Now turn to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 9/30/2023. In our Senior Housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 2.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.95 times. It is also worth noting that our trailing three-month coverage in this segment moved above 1 times for the first time since the pandemic. Next, same-store NOI in a long-term post-acute portfolio group grew 5.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.36 times. Turn to capital activity. We invested $3 billion in acquisitions, loans and developments in the quarter, led by $2.1 billion of Senior Housing Operating investments. In the quarter, we continue to fund investment activity via equity issuance, completing a bought equity deal in November, which along with regular way ATM activity resulted in $2.8 billion of gross proceeds in the quarter, an average price of $86.20 per share. This equity issuance allowed us to fund investment activity, along with the extinguishment of approximately $250 million of debt in the quarter and end the year with a $2.1 billion cash balance. Staying with the balance sheet, as we finish 2023, I want to highlight the balance sheet transformation that has occurred over the last 24 months. When COVID hit in 2020, we acted quickly to protect the balance sheet by securing substantial incremental liquidity, in large part by reducing cash outlays and taking advantage of strong asset values by selling long lease duration assets into a zero interest rate environment. These actions helped alleviate the impact of nearly 50% drawdown in Senior Housing Operating NOI that bottomed out in the first quarter of 2021, driving peak leverage to nearly 7.5 times ex-HHS funds. After stabilizing the portfolio in the sevens in 2021, the combination of a strong recovery in Senior Housing performance and disciplined equitization of external growth over the last two years has allowed us to methodically lower leverage, finishing this year with 5.03 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Consistent with past commentary around the balance sheet, I want to underscore that despite the improvements in metrics, current leverage still does not reflect a full post-COVID recovery in Senior Housing Operating NOI, as our portfolio still sits meaningfully below pre-COVID NOI levels. A recovery back to these levels will drive leverage well below 5 times. In summary, in 2023, our post-COVID balance sheet recovery transitioned into a strategic repositioning, ending the year with substantially upgraded metrics from prior to the pandemic, an expectation for further improvement as our Senior Housing Operating portfolio continues to carry significant organic cash flow growth momentum into 2024. This positions us with substantial capacity to continue to make systematically opportunistic capital allocation decisions to drive long-term shareholder returns in any market environment. Lastly, as I move on to the introduction of our full year 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not included any investment activity in our outlook beyond that which has already been announced publicly. Last night, we introduced an initial full year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders of $1.21 per diluted share to $1.37 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.94 per diluted share to $4.10 per diluted share or $4.02 at the midpoint. As mentioned in our release last night, our 2024 guidance contemplates no HHS or other government grants, so after adjusting for $0.03 received in 2023, the midpoint of our initial guidance represents 11.5% year-over-year growth. This year-over-year increase in FFO per share is composed of a $0.33 increase from higher year-over-year Senior Housing Operating NOI, $0.02 increase from higher NOI in our Outpatient Medical and triple-net lease portfolios, a $0.04 headwind from higher year-over-year growth in G&A expenses tied mainly to the continued build-out of our operating platform, and finally, a $0.10 increase from investment activity and financing activity. Underlying this FFO guidance is an estimate of total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8.25% to 11.5%, driven by sub-segment growth of Outpatient Medical 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute 2% to 3%, Senior Housing triple-net 2.5% to 4%, and finally, Senior Housing Operating growth of 15% to 21%, the midpoint of which is driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.2%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation for RevPOR growth of approximately 5.25% and an acceleration in year-over-year occupancy growth to 290 basis points. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. Yeah. I will start with the RevPOR and then I'll hand it over to John for any comment on kind of the operating spend side. But thinking about the RevPOR, think about kind of 5 to 5.5 being kind of the range that drives, that kind of flexes from the bottom to the top of that range. Yeah. Thanks, Nick. So you're correct on the excess debt side or excess cash side. I will highlight that, as you indicated in the past, we have $1.35 billion unsecured maturities here in the first quarter. So $450 million of which matured in January and we paid off and the remainder will be paid off in March. So that's one component of the uses and I think what you're hearing from the rest of our team today is a lot of optimism around opportunities to put cash to work. So I think the balance sheet is very well positioned for that."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Welltower Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to welcome Matt McQueen, General Counsel to begin the call. Matt, over to you.\nMatthew McQueen: Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review our third quarter results and capital allocation activities. John will provide an update on performance of our Senior Housing Operating and Outpatient Medical Portfolios. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and revised guidance. Nikhil is also participate in the Q&A session of the call. Against a backdrop of increasingly uncertain macroeconomic outlook, I\u2019m pleased to report another strong operating results with which continue to exceed our expectations. Our Senior Housing portfolio posted another quarter of exceptional revenue growth, which continues to approximate double-digit levels, driven by both strong pricing power and occupancy build. We are delighted to report that occupancy growth not only accelerated through Q3, but also that September occupancy gains marked the highest level we've seen over the last 2 years. From a pricing standpoint, we continue to achieve outsized rate increases as reflected by nearly 7% growth in RevPAR or unit revenue. As you may recall, we previously mentioned that last year, one of our largest operator pull forward its typical January increase to September 2022. This year, the same operator elected to maintain its historical cadence of rate increases and will therefore wait until January of 2024 to push through rate increases. As a result, reported pricing of Q3 this year may appear lower than what we are experiencing in the business and it bears repeating that our operators' pricing power remains strong. The story on the expense side is similar to that of our top line and result continues to outperform our elevated expectations. We reported 2.4% expense per occupied room growth or unit expense growth, the lowest reported export growth in the company's recorded history. This is largely driven by a 2.7% increase in compensation per occupied room, which represents a substantial step down in recent quarters. This combination of strong revenue and controlled expense growth has generated 333 basis points of same-store margin expansion, yet another record for the company as it marks the highest level of quarterly margin improvement in our recorded history. And our shop NOI margin of 25.6% is the highest level of profitability we achieved since pre-COVID. NOI growth for the quarter came in 26.1%, our fourth consecutive quarter of 20% plus NOI growth and the second highest level of growth in the company's recorded history. While we are pleased that margins are moving in the right direction, we are also mindful that our profitability remains significantly below pre-COVID levels and below where we believe the industry can attract external capital investment on a long-term basis. Our managers strive to deliver a superior product, experience and provide valuable choices for our retired seniors. Our product remains highly affordable at the high-end while we operate in the U.S. and the U.K. and they should continue to focus on highly differentiated services, even if that means rate increases need to remain at the elevated levels. As I've said many times, cutting corners is not in our DNA. We recommend that our operating partners serve fewer residents well than serve more of them poorly. As a result, one of our key items to focus is to work with the right operator to improve the customer and the employee experience. We believe that doing so will improve the experience of all [technical difficulty] all of our stakeholders. Conversely, we will be very disappointed if our operators take the path of lease resistance, which ultimately will impact resident and employee satisfaction. We continue to focus on the delta of RevPOR minus ExpPOR as the single most important operating metric to optimize. While it is too early to comment on anything specific relative to 2024, as I sit here today, I can believe -- I believe that the delta of RevPOR minus ExpPOR can expand, which we need to get to a sustainable level of margin. From a product standpoint, AL continues to outperform IL and from a geographic standpoint, Canada finally caught up to the level of growth that U.S and U.K were experiencing. We have further retailing to do in our Canadian business with a new operating platform being launched in next few weeks. And going forward, we believe both of our international businesses will have been significant contributors to our earnings growth in '24 and '25. From a capital allocation standpoint, we have never been busier. Last quarter we spoke about a pipeline of $2.3 billion. We closed $1.4 billion in Q3, and roughly another $900 million in October. Additionally, we have another $1 billion of deals just about to cross the finish line. Beyond these billion dollars of investments under contract, our pipeline remains large and near-term actionable. But the execution of these deals will depend on our access to capital. The extremely challenged debt and equity market in this higher for longer rate environment suggests that this trend will continue and perhaps will get better in '24. We'll continue to see credit evaporate from our investment universe and are selectively pursuing great opportunities in both whole stack and med stack levels with highly favorable last dollar exposure. These opportunities have potential to achieve equity returns with basis and credit downside protection typically seen in low leverage transactions. We're seeing opportunities across product types and geographies with equity investments in U.S senior housing, and credit investment on the SNF [ph] side, making up the large stewards [ph] of opportunities that we're constantly being pinned on. I want to remind you that we have a three dimensional lens through which we measured investment opportunities: risk, reward and duration. Given the substantial rise of real rates over the last 90 days, we have recalibrated the thresholds of these three thresholds higher. In other words, for the same risk we need higher returns today than we did 90 days ago or we can do deals with a similar return profile, but with a much lower risk and so forth. Where student of history and markets and cannot find many times when a lot of good has come out of a period of highly -- sharply higher real rates. If real rates continue to grow -- grind higher, we'll continue to calibrate our three guideposts higher. So far, we have no problem achieving these three calibrations as sellers understand the markets have changed, and will remain the best at many times, the only hope for liquidity. From a balance sheet perspective, amidst growing macroeconomic, fiscal and geopolitical uncertainty, we're pleased to have reduced our net debt to adjusted EBITDA to one of the lowest levels in our recorded history, which also represent nearly 2x decline from just 12 months ago. Our balance sheet strength and flexibility gives us opportunity to remain on offence, or provides shelter if the economic environment meaningfully what sits next week. We don't have a clue which direction the wind will blow. But I'm delighted that we don't need fair weather to meet our obligations or growth. As you all know, a wall of debt maturity and commercial real estate sector is coming exactly at a time when debt capital is evaporating from the market. We will not be surprised if significant dilutive capital is raised, or otherwise a lot of keys will need to be returned to the lenders. I'm certainly grateful to Tim and our best of class -- best-in-class capital markets team for keeping us ahead of the cadence that Nikhil and I can spend on as we look to capitalize on the best environment for investments that we have ever seen. Year-end is shaping up to be extremely busy. And Q1 also looks promising if we continue to have access to growth capital. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I want to reiterate, that will only grow externally, if and only if, we can grow value accretively on a partial [ph] basis for existing shareholders. I hope that you as our shareholders are as excited as I am about our operating results and capital allocation activities. But interestingly, those are not the most exciting things -- exciting areas inside Welltower today. What truly galvanizes us are the exciting prospects of John's operating platform, and especially the digital transformation of senior housing industry. As we have discussed ad nauseam, we refuse to accept the lack of 21st century business process and technology infrastructure of the primarily people driven business where individual community -- communities are on their own island. We have made tremendous strides in last 90 days on the technology backbone of what Welltower 3.0 may look like, and how far we can raise the bar for resident and employee experience. Welltower's engine room is buzzing with pilots and scaling, and traditional technology solutions like from ERP and CRM to advanced technology solutions around robotics and artificial intelligence. Our goal is to elevate the community experience by delighting the customer and their families and simplify and enhance the employee experience, all of which should lead to occupancy and NOI growth. Then, and only then, do we have to have a shot at earning a long-term sustainable return for our owners, which has been less than satisfactory over the last decade. My partners and I are truly inspired and are hopeful that we're turning the corner to achieve multiyear double-digit compounding growth rate. While supply and demand backdrop is squarely in our favor, we're far more focused on the value at alpha from our platform with you as our fellow owners have funded to build with our blood, sweat and tears. And with that, I'll pass the call over to John.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh. I know that it sounds like a broken record, but again, another great quarter. Our total portfolio generated 14.1% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter led by the senior housing operating portfolio with 26.1% year-over-year growth. We are methodically moving forward focused on the customer and employee experience and that is driving results. We started with brute force effectively relying on our raw labor to identify issues and opportunities. We continue to improve the systems and processes and organize the data to make data driven decisions to improve the business, and we're just at the beginning. The medical office portfolios third quarter same-store NOI growth was 3.4% over the prior year's quarter, same-store occupancy was 95%, while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at nearly 93%. The 26.1% third quarter year-over-year NOI increase in our same-store senior housing operating portfolio was a function of 9.8% revenue growth driven by the combination of 6.9% RevPOR growth, 220 basis points of average occupancy gain and moderating expense growth. Expenses remain in control coming in at 5.1% for the quarter over the prior year's quarter. The strong revenue growth and expense growth led to substantial margin expansion of 330 basis points. As Shankh has mentioned many times, the marginal increase in expenses as occupancy continues to grow over 80% is relatively low for obvious reasons. Many of the expenses are fixed. Each property has an Executive Director, Head Chef, Maintenance Director regardless of the occupancy level. The bulk of maintenance utility and many other costs are largely factored in at 80% occupancy. As a result, our Expense POR or Expense Per Occupied Room continues to remain low, enabling the business to improve the margins. As Shankh mentioned, our ExpPOR growth for the quarter was 2.4%, the lowest in our recorded history. All three of our regions continue to show strong same-store revenue growth, starting with the U.S at 9.6%, and Canada and the U.K growing at 9.7% and 12.9%, respectively. The strong revenue growth in each region combined with the expense controls have led to fantastic NOI growth in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., of 25.4%, 27.1% and 37%, respectively. The management transitions continue to perform above expectations. We are grateful to our operating partners, who are working so hard to ensure that we achieve the improved operations that we set out to accomplish in our journey to operational excellence. Our operators continue to do an amazing job of managing through the complexities of the business to provide a superior customer and employee experience. Many of our senior customers were born in the 1930s. The Depression. They have worked hard and sacrifice all their life and now they deserve to enjoy the fruits of their labor. The product and services remain very affordable to a large segment of the population who have purchased and paid off their homes years ago, and are now at a point where they can sell their home, live off their assets enjoying a good quality of life during their golden years, which they deserve. Our focus with our operating partners on improving the customer and employee experience benefits all stakeholders. For example, our focus on materially reducing agency labor improves both the customer and employee experience, as both are benefited by permanent high-quality employees compared to the random agency employees lacking relationships with our customers and knowledge of the community systems and processes. Additionally, eliminating the agency or middlemen enables us to ensure the hard working people at our communities receive a fair compensation package with vacation and benefits as well as competitive pay, and our shareholders benefit from the reduced leakage to the agency company owners. Care is the essence of the service provided and ensuring employees can deliver outstanding care is one of our top priorities. Our operating platform efficiencies will increase the time available for care and reduce the stress on our employees. For example, at one site, one of my team members worked at, the Executive Director spends over 3 hours per move-in inputting the documents into the antiquated systems. The CRM, [indiscernible] and Care modules are disparate systems. Our platform has all the documents in E-Form and the modules are fully integrated, reducing the potential for errors and saving time, which enables the site leader to focus on the customers and employees, not paperwork. We continue to make substantial progress on our platform and the related rollout. I'm grateful for the engagement and participation by the leadership of our operators who are actively working with us to ensure the success of the platform. More to come in 2024. I will now turn the call over to Tim.\nTim McHugh: Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2023 results. The performance of our triple-net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, a balance sheet and liquidity update, and finally our updated full year 2023 outlook. Welltower reported third quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.24 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.92 per diluted share, representing 10.4% year-over-year growth, or 16.5% growth after adjusting for HHS and the year-over-year impact from changes in FX rates and higher base rates and floating rate debt. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 14.1% year-over-year. Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported [indiscernible]. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30/2023. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 3.9% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is .93x. In the quarter, we agreed to convert 11 StoryPoint assets and triple-net lease to RIDEA, which will bring their regionally focused managed portfolio up to 55 Midwestern properties in the fourth quarter. Next, same-store NOI and our long-term post acute [ph] portfolio grew 5.3% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.44x. Turning to capital activity. We closed on $1.4 billion of acquisitions and loans in the quarter, led by $618 million of senior housing operating investments. As a reminder, the Revera PSP joint venture online that was announced last quarter will close by geography in three distinct phases. The U.K portion closed in 21Q and the U.S portion close this quarter, resulting in $75 million of net investment. And the Canadian portion is expected to close by year-end. In the quarter, we continue to issue through our ATM to fund ongoing investment spend and position the balance sheet for future opportunities. We raised gross proceeds of $1.9 billion, at an average price of approximately $81 per share, allowing us to fully fund year-to-date investment activity and also extinguish $290 million of debt in the quarter. This capital activity along with continued growth across our business segments including the continued post-COVID recovery within our senior housing operating business, help drive net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 5.14x at quarter end which represents 1.8x of deleveraging versus one year ago. We expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA to settle in the mid 5s on a pro forma basis post near-term investment activity, and it continued to trend downward in future quarters, as a recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio continues to drive organic cash flow higher. Additionally, filing this intra and post-quarter capital activity, including $900 million of gross investments closed to date in October, we have a current cash and cash equivalents balance of $2 billion, along with full capacity on our $4 million revolving line of credit and $624 million in remaining expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan pay downs, representing approximately $6.6 billion in near-term available liquidity. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance. Last night we updated our previously issued full year 2023 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to a range of $0.91 to $0.95 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.59 to $3.63 per diluted share, were $3.61 per share at the midpoint. Our normalized -- updated normalized FFO per share guidance represents a $0.055 increase at the midpoint of our previously updated guidance. This increasing guidance is reflective of a $0.03 increase from higher expected full year senior housing operating NOI, a $0.035 increase from capital allocation activity, which assumes no further investment year beyond what is close the date, and this increases are partially offset by combined penny drag on increase in expected full year G&A and stronger dollar. Underlying this FFO guidance is an increased estimate of total portfolio year-over-year at the same-store NOI growth of 11.5% to 13.5%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2.5% to 3%, long-term post-acute 4% to 5%, senior housing triple-net of 1.5% to 2.5%, and finally, increased senior housing operating growth of 23% to 26%. The midpoint of which is driven by continued better-than-expected expense trends, along with revenue growth of approximately 9.8% year-over-year. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 240 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth of approximately 6.7%. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. I want to conclude by turning your attention to three items that may not seem as important or exciting for our near-term results. On a combined basis, they may actually serve as a drag on our Q4. But nonetheless, it's extremely important to underscore as far as our stabilized or run rate earnings is concerned. First, we have convinced our partner StoryPoint to convert 11 properties from triple-net to RIDEA structure. 9 of these properties ran a historic lease structure with other operators, and 2 of them are recent acquisitions. StoryPoint is one of our best operators and a current RIDEA operator has cleaned up these billings, improved staffing, service quality and invested significant capital. These properties have gained 500 basis points of occupancy since beginning of the year to 70% in September, report is up 15% since they took over, RevPOR of the new movements in 2023 is up another 12% from the average of 2023 numbers. This is setting up the stage for significant cash flow growth in '24 and beyond. Debt to equity conversion at the bottom of the cycle, perhaps the most value accretive transaction we can complete today. As we have experienced in our recent legend conversion, we can expect to breakeven in 12 to 15 months relative to our previous contractual rent, and then our shareholders will get all the upside afterwards. This obviously will work only if you have great assets run by great managers and we are right about the trajectory of the cash flow. And that is the bet I'm willing to take at this point in the recovery cycle. We consider to -- we continue to seek additional opportunities to achieve similar outcomes when they check the boxes of great assets and operator quality and when we can expand the pie with our partner so that we can attain a win-win solution, an outcome for a long-term basis. Second, Kisco, one of our strongest operating partner, measured by margin, occupancy and other operating metrics, recently marched with another one of our operators, Balfour. Balfour, now a affiliate of Kisco, maintains a dominant position in the Denver [ph] metro area also has [indiscernible] buildings nearing completion in Brookline, in Boston MSA and Georgetown in D.C., both properties opening in 2024. We thank Schonbrun and Susan Juroe for their partnership at Balfour and wish them all the best for the next phase of their lives and welcome Andy Kohlberg and his team to take over the stewardship and growth of these communities. Like StoryPoint communities above, this transaction will be significantly accretive to our stabilized earnings and cash flow growth. Last but not least, when the final stages of Project Transformer, the transaction, which I described to you last quarter, with our teams working really hard with Matthew and Frederic at Cogir. Our brand launch is coming up in the next few weeks, and people are on both sides are working at a frenetic phase to achieve seamless transition. This is yet another transaction like the others above, which will look back at in '24 and '25 and feel really proud to have completed as they have added to our earnings and cash flow growth despite some near-term friction and the tremendous workload for the combined team. Speaking of earnings and cash flow growth, I would like you to provide a report card on the previous large transactions to Avery and Oakmont from Signature and Sunrise that we discussed with you in Q2. Both Avery and Oakmont have grown occupancy of approximately 300 basis points since transitions have begun. We, at Welltower, remain focused on the long-term price of getting this business to an elevated level of customer and employee experience and generating earnings per share that is substantially higher than where we came from. To sum it up, the powerful recovery in senior housing operating business, the rollout of our operating platform and a significantly accretive capital deployment are all setting us up for an accelerating earnings and cash flow trajectory for '24 and '25. With that, I'll open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess the sort of great opportunity on the external growth front, we have -- yesterday, we saw two of your peers merge, and I was hoping you could sort of give us a sense of as that process was explored, have you been -- is that something that's been of interest to you or could be of interest to you? And can you compare and contrast that line sort of entity deal with your sort of more granular approach going forward?\nShankh Mitra: So Vikram, I don't comment on other people's deals. It seems like it's a great outcome for both of them. We were not engaged, and we will not be engaged in that process, just to be specific. As we said many times, what works for us is one asset at a time transactions even if we do, when we do portfolios, Nikhil is finishing up a portfolio transaction right now of 10 assets that we have gotten. We have picked from a collection of 80, 90-plus assets. So it's sort of -- we're very, very focused on going deep than going broad in our markets. And we genuinely believe in small transactions with one asset at a time. I believe there are median size of assets, transactions that we have done in the last 3 years, which constitute this $12 million-or-so of assets we've bought is like $30 million. That's what we like, that works for us, and that's what will continue. We have no [indiscernible] opportunities. I mean what we see today, the market is, I will not be surprised, you guys will recall that we had talked about a few years ago, there will be potentially $30 billion of opportunities. As we sit here today, we can say the TAM is actually bigger than that, given how much loans that coming due, how much of floating rate debts are rolling over. So we have no problem growing the company as long as we have access to capital and we can do it on a per share [ph] basis. But large M&A is something that I've never liked. I'm not saying I'll never do it. But frankly speaking, it's just not much interest to us. And specifically answer to your question, we're not engaged and will not engage in the process that you mentioned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nConnor Siversky: Good morning out there. Thanks for taking the questions. I've got a three part one for you guys here. But on the Cogir transaction, can you offer a sense as to what occupancy levels look like in the properties earmarked to be managed by the operator in the future? And then is there a way to quantify the NOI upside potential from this transaction and ultimately, the transition of those properties? And finally, is that Regency case study outlined in the deck a good example to gauge what that NOI potential could look like for the broader Cogir portfolio?\nShankh Mitra: Connor, you were talking about, if I understand your question correctly, the Cogir transaction if you're talking about the properties that Cogir is taking over from Revera, the property occupancy is roughly around 80%. And we think that, as you know, Cogir obviously runs their properties well north of 90% occupancy and 40% margin, and I think we'll get there. What was the other part of the question, sorry, I missed that?\nConnor Siversky: So you outlined that Regency case study in the deck for those -- I think you were in British Columbia near Alberta. Is that a good example to use as a gauge for the NOI potential of the broader Cogir portfolio?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. I think you will see in this particular portfolio that we're talking about, the transition portfolio, Regency portfolio, Regency was a very well-run portfolio. This Cogir still has been able to get that margins, I believe, from around, call it, take up 40% to about 50%. In this particular case, I believe that the improvement will be better and will go from -- margins will go from, call it, say, up 20% to 40%. So I think we should see better enhancement in this particular case than the Regency example.\nConnor Siversky: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Impressive occupancy acceleration into September. Just curious what the early indications are for revenue increases to existing customers. I'm assuming some of the rate letters, apologies, have gone out already. So just curious how that year-over-year delta is looking for rent increases to existing customers? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Juan, as you know, we're sort of finalizing that as we speak, right? That's the discussion we are in. As I've mentioned in my prepared remarks that we expect that to be very strong like last couple of years and that's where we are. We are not there yet from a purely finalization standpoint. But I continue to believe that we'll achieve -- a customer is expecting an elevated level of service, costs are not coming down any place, the business overall for the industry, not just for us, remain at a suboptimal level of margins where you can attract capital to the business. So all these things putting together, I think you will see strong rate growth. What exactly that is, is too early to say, but I continue to expect that will be very strong.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Hughes: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Shankh, could you just clarify the any comments you gave in your prepared remarks where you said that the Kisco, Balfour merger might be a drag on the fourth quarter? I didn't quite understand why that might be the case? And then maybe one more, if I could sneak it in, the SHO portfolio outperformed that typical seasonality in the third quarter. I think that's expected to continue into year-end. Is that driven more so by the U.K. related changing same-store pool, something else? Just any additional color there would be great. Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Let me try the first one. So I did not say that specific transaction might be a drag on the fourth quarter. I said the three things that I described together could be a drag on the fourth quarter. But combined, all of them should be a significant driver of growth on 20 -- for '25 or just call it, stabilized earnings. That's the point I was trying to drive, not specifically about Kisco and Balfour.\nTim McHugh: And on your question on the seasonality in the business, you're correct. We continue to outperform the historical seasonality, and we are not seeing major differences between our transition portfolio. As Shankh mentioned, we are actually seeing very strong occupancy gains in the transition portfolio probably greater than what we've seen in the core portfolio.\nShankh Mitra: Jonathan, just the core portfolio, as you know, sequential occupancy growth was around 150 basis points and the transition portfolio, the two, I talked about was the majority of the transition we did in Q2. The occupancy growth in from signature to Avery and Sunrise to Oakmont, both portfolios achieved a sequential occupancy growth of roughly 300 basis points. So almost double of what the same-store did.\nOperator: [Indiscernible] with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. Yes, I was hoping to get maybe a little bit of a preview about how G&A could trend over the next year. And I know this year, there was the build out of John's group and just trying to understand like how far along that is and how that could affect G&A growth over the next year?\nShankh Mitra: Nick, as I mentioned early in the year, I think if you go back to fourth quarter call, we have at least another year of elevated G&A increase as a build out of the platform. So you should -- we have come long, but we have a long ways to go. So G&A versus NOI, just a geography of where you see occupancies versus revenues. So we do believe that the platform build out is paying off, has started to pay off in spades. But from a purely just looking purely at G&A item, we would expect that another year of build out -- at least another year of build out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. It's actually Nick Joseph here with Michael. Shankh, I recognize you said you're not engaged, you won't be engaged. But last year, you reportedly got involved in a similar public to public M&A situation within the medical office space. You talked in the past a lot about being an IR buyer and cost base focused and that you look at everything. So just curious in this situation or more broadly, is it kind of the current valuation and underwritten returns aren't sufficient against the other opportunities that you're seeing? Is it something about medical office that's keeping you on the sidelines here?\nShankh Mitra: So first thing I mentioned that I don't comment on other people's deals. So I have nothing underwritten, so I can't even comment on what the underwritten returns looks like. But specifically to medical office, I think I provided some color last quarter that we're unsure at this point what the long-term inflation land. And because we are unsure we are unsure of at this point to make a huge bet on an asset class that we don't know what the growth profile versus the long-term inflation looks like, right? So that's a very important point. We are finding opportunities where we think we can small opportunities where we can do value add. We are buying assets at 70%, 80% occupancy and leasing up and so that we can see the growth rate higher. But from a stabilized 95%, call it, occupied medical office with a 2.5% increase or whatever it is, the traditional medical office, which provides a good long-term, stable growth for institutional investors is not interesting for us. For that one reason. And the second reason is, it's always -- it's relative opportunities is the question, right? If that's the only thing that was available to us, will be a different conversation. We are easily picking off at low double-digit plus unlevered IRR opportunities in the senior living side assuming that we don't add much value, and I'm pretty positive we will add value. So it's just a question of relative opportunities of where we see we will today. And that's why we have no interest. By no means that suggests that we don't think it's a good deal or not a good deal. I have no idea what the deal is because I'm not engaged in it as I specifically mentioned will not because of the reasons I just pointed out to you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hey, guys. I have a question on the transitions. Shankh, you mentioned you've been very active in terms of proactive portfolio management. You achieved a lot of early success recently with Avery and Oakmont. How have these operators driven such strong results so quickly? And just how would you encourage us to think about future transitions in the portfolio?\nShankh Mitra: Yes, I'm not going to answer the first question, Josh. Obviously, on a public call, I mean, things called trade secrets that you don't want us to divulge on a public company call. But we'll say that this doesn't happen like automatically. As I've said before, we have learned. We have done a lot of transitions over the last, call it, 5, 7 years that I've been doing this, and we have learned our lessons from frankly, old school way of losing money. We have learned what we have done wrong. We have gotten better then sort of we learned how to start bleeding and then finally, we have gotten the other side of how do we -- how we can make an impact. What the prep work you need to do on systems and process and frankly, that's what John taught us, right? So it's just -- it's an evolution. It's a process that we have gotten over the last few years, and I'm very, very happy that we are there. Now from the point of view of transitions, is it the last transition, would we do 1,000 more transitions. It just depends on the performance we are trying to optimize our performance. I've said it many, many times that this is a business in our opinion, in our humble opinion. It's a business of optimizing location, product, price point and operator, right? So we'll keep optimizing it until we think that we were done. And that's kind of where we are. It's a journey I've written about that I'm willing to do even if we take short-term hits. And it appears, at least from near-term results, no guarantee of the future that we have achieved how to even mitigate that short-term hit.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nRichard Anderson: Hey, good morning, everyone. So I want to talk and perhaps to John on the rate number that you mentioned, the RevPOR number of 7% and specifically, the sustainability of that type of growth. It's always been my view that there was some sort of implied ceiling of growing rents for people that are 85 years old. And that at some point along the way that there's just a way of doing business. Now I don't know that there's a real ceiling of some sort, but it always seemed to me that was the case, correct me if I'm wrong? Number two, though, maybe it involves unpacking the rent, maybe it's rent between rent and care and so that kind of muddies the conversation. But I wonder if you could comment at any level about how rate might grow in the future considering what I would think would be some pushback for the reasons I just described?\nShankh Mitra: Rich, let me try to start that. And John, you sort of finish anything that I haven't added. So I think your conversation that you have is a reasonable for -- if you think about a long-term tenant in the middle of the market, right? So there is a -- you have to think about the customer you're talking about. We -- our rate increase is because we have sold majority of our mid-market product, our U.K. and U.S. portfolio is primarily focused on very high-end customer, very wealthy customer and the product remains incredibly affordable to them. And at that level, we haven't seen any pushback. The second point you have to consider Rich, is you -- we have never raised rates like you have seen in other asset classes, multifamily stores, others, 20%, 25%. We have never raised that, right? So just sort of rates remains high single digits, whatever, like 8%, 9%, 10% is sort of what we have done. So it's much more sustainable than you think. But put that aside, just understand, put all of those comments in the context of average length of stay, you're talking about an average length of stay of 20 months. So we might be here talking about for the third year of increase of X percent. But just understand, the person who got the first year of increase, he or she is gone, right? She's no longer in the community. So if you put all of those together, you will see that if you provide the very important point, if you provide the differentiated services at the highest level, your customer is willing to pay you. Now we are, as I've said many, many times, we're not focused on an individual number, call a RevPOR or rate, right? We're focused on very much of a delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR and that's what we are focused on. I've said that last year and the year before. And we shall see what the market gives us, right? I have no idea what the market will give us if there's a pushback, we will adjust, but we haven't seen any yet.\nJohn Burkart: Yes. I fully agree. It's the difference between RevPOR and Expense POR and it's -- I think you're probably, Rich, thinking about multifamily where people are there for years and years and years, and it's a very different situation here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Kammert with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJames Kammert: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I certainly appreciate the operating leverage embedded in the SHO portfolio. And I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color sort of regarding labor trends for the general staffing there and what conviction you have and the ability to really continue to sustain pretty attractive or capitated growth of those expenses? I mean are you getting longer tenures, so it's lower turnover and lower recruitment costs or just a better labor talent pool. And again, I'm just thinking more beyond the Chef [ph] and the General Manager, what levers are contributing to nice profile in terms of growth on the expenses for labor?\nShankh Mitra: Jim, you are correct that we are seeing turnover is coming down significantly. We are seeing that overall availability of employees who wants to be part of our business and part of the communities is increasing significantly. And we are seeing that our operating partners are getting better using technology and other resources to attract talent and keeping them in the business, right? So that sort of -- it's -- whenever you get hit by a crisis, people figure out ways to do things better, every crisis makes the business better if it survives, right? And that's what we are seeing. And what conviction do we have that RevPOR minus ExpPOR journey can continue very significantly. For a specific line item, on a specific thing, on a specific quarter, we have no idea. I said this a million times. Our goal here is not to predict the future. Our goal is to see what market gives us and do better than market. We'll see what market gives us.\nJohn Burkart: Yes. And I would just add, in my comments, my focus is on productivity. So we want our employees to be paid well. We want happy employees and happy customers. We also want to increase productivity of the business so that we can manage to accomplish all of that. So that's really, I think, the take home point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMike Mueller: Yes. Curious, how are you thinking about, I guess, senior housing development today? And how do you see starts potentially trending over the next couple of years?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. Mike, I'm just going to be repetitive here. I was asked this question at the NIC conference about a week ago or 10 days ago, whenever that was. I'll repeat what I said on the panel. I think if we're a debt provider in senior housing today, you have a better lot going to Vegas. And if we are an equity provider and senior housing development today, you have a better life buying lottery. I hope that tells you what my view of senior housing development is. I don't even understand why there is any start, any like more than 0 because the economics doesn't make any sense given where construction cost is, where capital cost is and where the margin of the business is. It should not have any starts and it seems like it's going there. I think any stock that you are seeing, people are still playing with other people's money, and that's coming down -- closing down pretty quickly. And I think you will continue to see it's moving down. Mike, did I miss any other part of your question?\nMike Mueller: No, that was it. Thank you.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Yes, thanks. Given the dislocation that we are seeing in the private market, is it harder for operators that are having liquidity issues to provide the same level of care versus your operators that presumably don't have these issues? I mean are you seeing that in the marketplace at all right now? And if not, do you expect that this will become a bigger storyline over the next several quarters?\nShankh Mitra: I can't speak for other people, Mike. I will tell you that we have -- our operators -- operating partners are doing extremely well. And we are getting hit left, right and center with new operating partner who wants to be part of our story. So whether that's because they're inspired to do what John is doing, our data journey or we are trying to professionalize the business or the detailed transformation journey or they're having troubles on their own end or both, I have no idea. But I could tell you that we have literally -- I mean, it is -- we've seen really good investment opportunities. but we have never seen anything like what we are seeing today. Whether that's because of a pull or a push, I have no idea. And we are seeing operators from all parts of the country, in all three countries we do business with, is calling us to be part of it this well-capitalized, extraordinarily well capitalized platform, but also the part of -- being part of John's platform.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, great. Just a big picture one. So looking at the presentation, the NOI, the incremental NOI build, I noticed that you guys added a bar here that looks like another $172 million. And I'm tying back to your comments about the focus on RevPOR versus ExpPOR. It's clearly a margin benefit here. So I was wondering if you could talk about that, why add that to the deck where -- is this -- are we supposed to read into it just more confidence in the ability to get back to pre-COVID margins, is the question.\nTim McHugh: Yes, Ron. So we added that to deck through conversations with both investors and analysts alike. They're looking at it interpreting kind of a stabilized point to be reflective of 88% occupancy and 31% margins. When in fact, with the rent growth we've seen since fourth quarter '19, as we were ignoring that rent growth and -- or with it, we are baking in around 29% margin. So what we wanted to do is just show getting back to just the NOI level on today's rents means that you're getting to margins that are 200 basis points plus below where we were margin wise in fourth quarter '19, and what that final bar does is just shows you getting back to 88% occupancy, 31% margin in pre-COVID levels at today's third quarter '23 realized rents where NOI would be.\nShankh Mitra: And Ron, I've said this before, I'll repeat it again. If that's all we go back to Q4 of '19 level or pre-COVID level, I would be very, very disappointed. If you have done this in Q4 of '19, you remember, those were not the greatest days of this business, right? So we were getting it for 4-plus years at this point and through our supply cycle. That is not a high point like a lot of other businesses are and we're very disappointed that's all we get back to.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm here with Connor. How should we think about funding assumptions for the next tranche of acquisitions? And then also, how does the quality of the assets you're looking at compared to the quality of your existing portfolio? Or put differently, how do you assure investors that you aren't moving up the risk curve to chase the return profile?\nShankh Mitra: I don't want to assure investors of anything. I think investors are aware of our track record, and you guys do a very good job of visiting our properties. So you can see it. The chasing the risk curve to get investments might happen when things are really, really tight. It is an exactly opposite environment, Jamie. And when those environments have occurred in the past, we were massive sellers of assets. We don't chase risk curves to get return. That's just not what we do. Now going back to your actual -- the crust of your question is, frankly speaking, the initial part of COVID, what we are noticing was sort of a lot of broken cash flows, right? Assets while 60%, 70% occupied; new development, brand new assets, 3 years, 4 years, 2-year-old assets, but broken cash flow because that's normal for a business that had breaks even at 60% occupancy and your marginal sort of return, if you will, or your marginal or incremental margins sort of go hockey stake is normal for that period of time given how much occupancy we lost during COVID to have those kind of asset; great assets, broken cash flow because of what the occupancy is and how margins work in this business. That was 2 years ago, 3 years ago, that's what sort of we were seeing. Today, we are seeing broken capital structure, assets are generating the cash flow that you should be generating at 80% occupancy, 82% occupancy where the industry is, call it, 6%, 6.5%, whatever it is, the cash flow yield -- that's not the problem. The problem is the underlying leverage, which is now so far plus 350, 400 is at 9%. That's the problem and those loans are coming to you, you are upside down on a cash flow basis and your upside down on a leverage basis. And those are the ones that are transacting today. So frankly speaking, the number of trophy buildings, number of high-quality, high high-quality buildings, which core investor zone, the core [indiscernible] zone that we have seen in last, call it, 6 months even last 4 months, I haven't seen the 4 years before that, right? And so the quality of opportunities are going up pretty significantly, but it is up to you to decide what is the quality of assets we are buying. And we give assets, you can go and visit them, and I think you will come to the same conclusion. Did I miss any part of the question?\nTim McHugh: And, Jamie, on your funding question. So in my prepared remarks, I spoke to kind of a liquidity build, and that's as of October 30. So we talked about $900 million in investments just quarter-to-date closed in October, $1 billion pipeline ahead of us about $2 billion in cash and $6.6 billion of total available liquidity to fund that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks. Shankh, you were crystal clear with your thoughts on why development doesn't make sense broadly in senior housing today, but you did expand the development pipeline, I think it was up $600 million this quarter, roughly half of that was in senior housing. And clearly, you have a cost of capital advantage today. But I mean, is that what gives you the comfort moving forward with these projects? And then I'm curious, are developers coming to you to partner on future projects that can't sort of access construction financing? And how does that opportunity set compare versus acquisitions?\nShankh Mitra: So I think, if I understand correctly, Nikhil correct me if I'm wrong, all our development starts are either fully 100% leased medical office developments that we have long-term tail or long-term contracts with our existing clients or their wellness housing development. I do not believe that we have started any senior housing development. I don't remember when was the last time we actually started the senior housing development. So because of the all reporting in the same bucket, Austin, but they're not senior housing development, there are what in the -- what we call wellness housing, which is age restricted and age targeted apartment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. It's Juan here with Juan [ph] still. Just a quick question on the investment pipeline. Could you give a breakdown of kind of what you're looking at? And where do you think you see or where are stabilized deals say for what you're targeting in the major food groups?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So the pipeline today is, as I said, I don't know, Nikhil, but it's like 80% plus would be senior housing. And mostly, I would say, equity in senior living and probably maybe 90%. But vast majority of senior living and core equity opportunities in senior living just because of the size. It's just a lot of it is in U.S. And we just closed a large transaction in Canada. So if I think about -- remember it correctly, it's almost entire -- not entirely, but majority is U.S. senior housing and there are some credit opportunities in the [indiscernible]. I don't remember any transaction or pipeline about any MOBs, but do you know anything?\nNikhil Chaudhri: Nothing meaningful.\nShankh Mitra: Okay. And stabilized yields, I would say, in the senior living today, we are targeting close to 8 on a stabilized basis and going in. I think I said last call, we are seeing sort of opportunities that starting at 6, ending at 8 and given the rise of real rates, we are seeing better than that today. Frankly, we have ratcheted our return expectations higher. So that's sort of where we are transacting. But we are not a yield buyer. We are still happy to buy 1% yield, if we think that's the right basis and the right assets. But generally speaking, those are the kind of opportunities we are seeing.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks for the -- taking the follow-up. Nikhil or Shankh, can you just update us on the Integra process? How are those assets been performing? And by extension, is there -- are there additional opportunities? I just asked that because you had earlier outlined upon stabilization, you might look to sell some of that. So would just be helpful to get an update on Integra. Thanks.\nNikhil Chaudhri: Yes, Vikram. So we are pleased with the performance that we are seeing. Last quarter, I talked about the first 133 out of the 147 buildings that have transitioned. In the last quarter, those buildings produced roughly $70 million of positive EBITDARM compared to negative $90 million for the 3 months prior to the transition. Now fast forward another quarter, those same buildings in the second quarter generated $127 million of EBITDARM. So in the 6 months since transition, you're seeing a cash flow swing of $215 plus million and obviously, every month continues to be better than the prior month. And so if you look at June end and you annualize that, you were roughly $170 million, which is north of the rent, right? So here we are 6 months in when we had underwritten this, we thought it would take us much longer 18 months, give or take, to get to this point. So we are incredibly pleased with the performance. But we think there's still a long ways to go. So your point about exiting upon stabilization, we are happy with the progress, but we are far from stabilization.\nOperator: This concludes the Welltower third quarter conference call.

            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. I know that it sounds like a broken record, but again, another great quarter. Our total portfolio generated 14.1% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter led by the senior housing operating portfolio with 26.1% year-over-year growth. We are methodically moving forward focused on the customer and employee experience and that is driving results. We started with brute force effectively relying on our raw labor to identify issues and opportunities. We continue to improve the systems and processes and organize the data to make data driven decisions to improve the business, and we're just at the beginning. The medical office portfolios third quarter same-store NOI growth was 3.4% over the prior year's quarter, same-store occupancy was 95%, while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at nearly 93%. The 26.1% third quarter year-over-year NOI increase in our same-store senior housing operating portfolio was a function of 9.8% revenue growth driven by the combination of 6.9% RevPOR growth, 220 basis points of average occupancy gain and moderating expense growth. Expenses remain in control coming in at 5.1% for the quarter over the prior year's quarter. The strong revenue growth and expense growth led to substantial margin expansion of 330 basis points. As Shankh has mentioned many times, the marginal increase in expenses as occupancy continues to grow over 80% is relatively low for obvious reasons. Many of the expenses are fixed. Each property has an Executive Director, Head Chef, Maintenance Director regardless of the occupancy level. The bulk of maintenance utility and many other costs are largely factored in at 80% occupancy. As a result, our Expense POR or Expense Per Occupied Room continues to remain low, enabling the business to improve the margins. As Shankh mentioned, our ExpPOR growth for the quarter was 2.4%, the lowest in our recorded history. All three of our regions continue to show strong same-store revenue growth, starting with the U.S at 9.6%, and Canada and the U.K growing at 9.7% and 12.9%, respectively. The strong revenue growth in each region combined with the expense controls have led to fantastic NOI growth in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., of 25.4%, 27.1% and 37%, respectively. The management transitions continue to perform above expectations. We are grateful to our operating partners, who are working so hard to ensure that we achieve the improved operations that we set out to accomplish in our journey to operational excellence. Our operators continue to do an amazing job of managing through the complexities of the business to provide a superior customer and employee experience. Many of our senior customers were born in the 1930s. The Depression. They have worked hard and sacrifice all their life and now they deserve to enjoy the fruits of their labor. The product and services remain very affordable to a large segment of the population who have purchased and paid off their homes years ago, and are now at a point where they can sell their home, live off their assets enjoying a good quality of life during their golden years, which they deserve. Our focus with our operating partners on improving the customer and employee experience benefits all stakeholders. For example, our focus on materially reducing agency labor improves both the customer and employee experience, as both are benefited by permanent high-quality employees compared to the random agency employees lacking relationships with our customers and knowledge of the community systems and processes. Additionally, eliminating the agency or middlemen enables us to ensure the hard working people at our communities receive a fair compensation package with vacation and benefits as well as competitive pay, and our shareholders benefit from the reduced leakage to the agency company owners. Care is the essence of the service provided and ensuring employees can deliver outstanding care is one of our top priorities. Our operating platform efficiencies will increase the time available for care and reduce the stress on our employees. For example, at one site, one of my team members worked at, the Executive Director spends over 3 hours per move-in inputting the documents into the antiquated systems. The CRM, [indiscernible] and Care modules are disparate systems. Our platform has all the documents in E-Form and the modules are fully integrated, reducing the potential for errors and saving time, which enables the site leader to focus on the customers and employees, not paperwork. We continue to make substantial progress on our platform and the related rollout. I'm grateful for the engagement and participation by the leadership of our operators who are actively working with us to ensure the success of the platform. More to come in 2024. I will now turn the call over to Tim. Yes. I fully agree. It's the difference between RevPOR and Expense POR and it's -- I think you're probably, Rich, thinking about multifamily where people are there for years and years and years, and it's a very different situation here. Yes. And I would just add, in my comments, my focus is on productivity. So we want our employees to be paid well. We want happy employees and happy customers. We also want to increase productivity of the business so that we can manage to accomplish all of that. So that's really, I think, the take home point."

            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review our third quarter results and capital allocation activities. John will provide an update on performance of our Senior Housing Operating and Outpatient Medical Portfolios. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and revised guidance. Nikhil is also participate in the Q&A session of the call. Against a backdrop of increasingly uncertain macroeconomic outlook, I'm pleased to report another strong operating results with which continue to exceed our expectations. Our Senior Housing portfolio posted another quarter of exceptional revenue growth, which continues to approximate double-digit levels, driven by both strong pricing power and occupancy build. We are delighted to report that occupancy growth not only accelerated through Q3, but also that September occupancy gains marked the highest level we've seen over the last 2 years. From a pricing standpoint, we continue to achieve outsized rate increases as reflected by nearly 7% growth in RevPAR or unit revenue. As you may recall, we previously mentioned that last year, one of our largest operator pull forward its typical January increase to September 2022. This year, the same operator elected to maintain its historical cadence of rate increases and will therefore wait until January of 2024 to push through rate increases. As a result, reported pricing of Q3 this year may appear lower than what we are experiencing in the business and it bears repeating that our operators' pricing power remains strong. The story on the expense side is similar to that of our top line and result continues to outperform our elevated expectations. We reported 2.4% expense per occupied room growth or unit expense growth, the lowest reported export growth in the company's recorded history. This is largely driven by a 2.7% increase in compensation per occupied room, which represents a substantial step down in recent quarters. This combination of strong revenue and controlled expense growth has generated 333 basis points of same-store margin expansion, yet another record for the company as it marks the highest level of quarterly margin improvement in our recorded history. And our shop NOI margin of 25.6% is the highest level of profitability we achieved since pre-COVID. NOI growth for the quarter came in 26.1%, our fourth consecutive quarter of 20% plus NOI growth and the second highest level of growth in the company's recorded history. While we are pleased that margins are moving in the right direction, we are also mindful that our profitability remains significantly below pre-COVID levels and below where we believe the industry can attract external capital investment on a long-term basis. Our managers strive to deliver a superior product, experience and provide valuable choices for our retired seniors. Our product remains highly affordable at the high-end while we operate in the U.S. and the U.K. and they should continue to focus on highly differentiated services, even if that means rate increases need to remain at the elevated levels. As I've said many times, cutting corners is not in our DNA. We recommend that our operating partners serve fewer residents well than serve more of them poorly. As a result, one of our key items to focus is to work with the right operator to improve the customer and the employee experience. We believe that doing so will improve the experience of all [technical difficulty] all of our stakeholders. Conversely, we will be very disappointed if our operators take the path of lease resistance, which ultimately will impact resident and employee satisfaction. We continue to focus on the delta of RevPOR minus ExpPOR as the single most important operating metric to optimize. While it is too early to comment on anything specific relative to 2024, as I sit here today, I can believe -- I believe that the delta of RevPOR minus ExpPOR can expand, which we need to get to a sustainable level of margin. From a product standpoint, AL continues to outperform IL and from a geographic standpoint, Canada finally caught up to the level of growth that U.S and U.K were experiencing. We have further retailing to do in our Canadian business with a new operating platform being launched in next few weeks. And going forward, we believe both of our international businesses will have been significant contributors to our earnings growth in '24 and '25. From a capital allocation standpoint, we have never been busier. Last quarter we spoke about a pipeline of $2.3 billion. We closed $1.4 billion in Q3, and roughly another $900 million in October. Additionally, we have another $1 billion of deals just about to cross the finish line. Beyond these billion dollars of investments under contract, our pipeline remains large and near-term actionable. But the execution of these deals will depend on our access to capital. The extremely challenged debt and equity market in this higher for longer rate environment suggests that this trend will continue and perhaps will get better in '24. We'll continue to see credit evaporate from our investment universe and are selectively pursuing great opportunities in both whole stack and med stack levels with highly favorable last dollar exposure. These opportunities have potential to achieve equity returns with basis and credit downside protection typically seen in low leverage transactions. We're seeing opportunities across product types and geographies with equity investments in U.S senior housing, and credit investment on the SNF [ph] side, making up the large stewards [ph] of opportunities that we're constantly being pinned on. I want to remind you that we have a three dimensional lens through which we measured investment opportunities: risk, reward and duration. Given the substantial rise of real rates over the last 90 days, we have recalibrated the thresholds of these three thresholds higher. In other words, for the same risk we need higher returns today than we did 90 days ago or we can do deals with a similar return profile, but with a much lower risk and so forth. Where student of history and markets and cannot find many times when a lot of good has come out of a period of highly -- sharply higher real rates. If real rates continue to grow -- grind higher, we'll continue to calibrate our three guideposts higher. So far, we have no problem achieving these three calibrations as sellers understand the markets have changed, and will remain the best at many times, the only hope for liquidity. From a balance sheet perspective, amidst growing macroeconomic, fiscal and geopolitical uncertainty, we're pleased to have reduced our net debt to adjusted EBITDA to one of the lowest levels in our recorded history, which also represent nearly 2x decline from just 12 months ago. Our balance sheet strength and flexibility gives us opportunity to remain on offence, or provides shelter if the economic environment meaningfully what sits next week. We don't have a clue which direction the wind will blow. But I'm delighted that we don't need fair weather to meet our obligations or growth. As you all know, a wall of debt maturity and commercial real estate sector is coming exactly at a time when debt capital is evaporating from the market. We will not be surprised if significant dilutive capital is raised, or otherwise a lot of keys will need to be returned to the lenders. I'm certainly grateful to Tim and our best of class -- best-in-class capital markets team for keeping us ahead of the cadence that Nikhil and I can spend on as we look to capitalize on the best environment for investments that we have ever seen. Year-end is shaping up to be extremely busy. And Q1 also looks promising if we continue to have access to growth capital. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I want to reiterate, that will only grow externally, if and only if, we can grow value accretively on a partial [ph] basis for existing shareholders. I hope that you as our shareholders are as excited as I am about our operating results and capital allocation activities. But interestingly, those are not the most exciting things -- exciting areas inside Welltower today. What truly galvanizes us are the exciting prospects of John's operating platform, and especially the digital transformation of senior housing industry. As we have discussed ad nauseam, we refuse to accept the lack of 21st century business process and technology infrastructure of the primarily people driven business where individual community -- communities are on their own island. We have made tremendous strides in last 90 days on the technology backbone of what Welltower 3.0 may look like, and how far we can raise the bar for resident and employee experience. Welltower's engine room is buzzing with pilots and scaling, and traditional technology solutions like from ERP and CRM to advanced technology solutions around robotics and artificial intelligence. Our goal is to elevate the community experience by delighting the customer and their families and simplify and enhance the employee experience, all of which should lead to occupancy and NOI growth. Then, and only then, do we have to have a shot at earning a long-term sustainable return for our owners, which has been less than satisfactory over the last decade. My partners and I are truly inspired and are hopeful that we're turning the corner to achieve multiyear double-digit compounding growth rate. While supply and demand backdrop is squarely in our favor, we're far more focused on the value at alpha from our platform with you as our fellow owners have funded to build with our blood, sweat and tears. And with that, I'll pass the call over to John. Thank you, Tim. I want to conclude by turning your attention to three items that may not seem as important or exciting for our near-term results. On a combined basis, they may actually serve as a drag on our Q4. But nonetheless, it's extremely important to underscore as far as our stabilized or run rate earnings is concerned. First, we have convinced our partner StoryPoint to convert 11 properties from triple-net to RIDEA structure. 9 of these properties ran a historic lease structure with other operators, and 2 of them are recent acquisitions. StoryPoint is one of our best operators and a current RIDEA operator has cleaned up these billings, improved staffing, service quality and invested significant capital. These properties have gained 500 basis points of occupancy since beginning of the year to 70% in September, report is up 15% since they took over, RevPOR of the new movements in 2023 is up another 12% from the average of 2023 numbers. This is setting up the stage for significant cash flow growth in '24 and beyond. Debt to equity conversion at the bottom of the cycle, perhaps the most value accretive transaction we can complete today. As we have experienced in our recent legend conversion, we can expect to breakeven in 12 to 15 months relative to our previous contractual rent, and then our shareholders will get all the upside afterwards. This obviously will work only if you have great assets run by great managers and we are right about the trajectory of the cash flow. And that is the bet I'm willing to take at this point in the recovery cycle. We consider to -- we continue to seek additional opportunities to achieve similar outcomes when they check the boxes of great assets and operator quality and when we can expand the pie with our partner so that we can attain a win-win solution, an outcome for a long-term basis. Second, Kisco, one of our strongest operating partner, measured by margin, occupancy and other operating metrics, recently marched with another one of our operators, Balfour. Balfour, now a affiliate of Kisco, maintains a dominant position in the Denver [ph] metro area also has [indiscernible] buildings nearing completion in Brookline, in Boston MSA and Georgetown in D.C., both properties opening in 2024. We thank Schonbrun and Susan Juroe for their partnership at Balfour and wish them all the best for the next phase of their lives and welcome Andy Kohlberg and his team to take over the stewardship and growth of these communities. Like StoryPoint communities above, this transaction will be significantly accretive to our stabilized earnings and cash flow growth. Last but not least, when the final stages of Project Transformer, the transaction, which I described to you last quarter, with our teams working really hard with Matthew and Frederic at Cogir. Our brand launch is coming up in the next few weeks, and people are on both sides are working at a frenetic phase to achieve seamless transition. This is yet another transaction like the others above, which will look back at in '24 and '25 and feel really proud to have completed as they have added to our earnings and cash flow growth despite some near-term friction and the tremendous workload for the combined team. Speaking of earnings and cash flow growth, I would like you to provide a report card on the previous large transactions to Avery and Oakmont from Signature and Sunrise that we discussed with you in Q2. Both Avery and Oakmont have grown occupancy of approximately 300 basis points since transitions have begun. We, at Welltower, remain focused on the long-term price of getting this business to an elevated level of customer and employee experience and generating earnings per share that is substantially higher than where we came from. To sum it up, the powerful recovery in senior housing operating business, the rollout of our operating platform and a significantly accretive capital deployment are all setting us up for an accelerating earnings and cash flow trajectory for '24 and '25. With that, I'll open the call up for questions. So Vikram, I don't comment on other people's deals. It seems like it's a great outcome for both of them. We were not engaged, and we will not be engaged in that process, just to be specific. As we said many times, what works for us is one asset at a time transactions even if we do, when we do portfolios, Nikhil is finishing up a portfolio transaction right now of 10 assets that we have gotten. We have picked from a collection of 80, 90-plus assets. So it's sort of -- we're very, very focused on going deep than going broad in our markets. And we genuinely believe in small transactions with one asset at a time. I believe there are median size of assets, transactions that we have done in the last 3 years, which constitute this $12 million-or-so of assets we've bought is like $30 million. That's what we like, that works for us, and that's what will continue. We have no [indiscernible] opportunities. I mean what we see today, the market is, I will not be surprised, you guys will recall that we had talked about a few years ago, there will be potentially $30 billion of opportunities. As we sit here today, we can say the TAM is actually bigger than that, given how much loans that coming due, how much of floating rate debts are rolling over. So we have no problem growing the company as long as we have access to capital and we can do it on a per share [ph] basis. But large M&A is something that I've never liked. I'm not saying I'll never do it. But frankly speaking, it's just not much interest to us. And specifically answer to your question, we're not engaged and will not engage in the process that you mentioned. Connor, you were talking about, if I understand your question correctly, the Cogir transaction if you're talking about the properties that Cogir is taking over from Revera, the property occupancy is roughly around 80%. And we think that, as you know, Cogir obviously runs their properties well north of 90% occupancy and 40% margin, and I think we'll get there. What was the other part of the question, sorry, I missed that? Yes. I think you will see in this particular portfolio that we're talking about, the transition portfolio, Regency portfolio, Regency was a very well-run portfolio. This Cogir still has been able to get that margins, I believe, from around, call it, take up 40% to about 50%. In this particular case, I believe that the improvement will be better and will go from -- margins will go from, call it, say, up 20% to 40%. So I think we should see better enhancement in this particular case than the Regency example. Juan, as you know, we're sort of finalizing that as we speak, right? That's the discussion we are in. As I've mentioned in my prepared remarks that we expect that to be very strong like last couple of years and that's where we are. We are not there yet from a purely finalization standpoint. But I continue to believe that we'll achieve -- a customer is expecting an elevated level of service, costs are not coming down any place, the business overall for the industry, not just for us, remain at a suboptimal level of margins where you can attract capital to the business. So all these things putting together, I think you will see strong rate growth. What exactly that is, is too early to say, but I continue to expect that will be very strong. Let me try the first one. So I did not say that specific transaction might be a drag on the fourth quarter. I said the three things that I described together could be a drag on the fourth quarter. But combined, all of them should be a significant driver of growth on 20 -- for '25 or just call it, stabilized earnings. That's the point I was trying to drive, not specifically about Kisco and Balfour. Jonathan, just the core portfolio, as you know, sequential occupancy growth was around 150 basis points and the transition portfolio, the two, I talked about was the majority of the transition we did in Q2. The occupancy growth in from signature to Avery and Sunrise to Oakmont, both portfolios achieved a sequential occupancy growth of roughly 300 basis points. So almost double of what the same-store did. Nick, as I mentioned early in the year, I think if you go back to fourth quarter call, we have at least another year of elevated G&A increase as a build out of the platform. So you should -- we have come long, but we have a long ways to go. So G&A versus NOI, just a geography of where you see occupancies versus revenues. So we do believe that the platform build out is paying off, has started to pay off in spades. But from a purely just looking purely at G&A item, we would expect that another year of build out -- at least another year of build out. So first thing I mentioned that I don't comment on other people's deals. So I have nothing underwritten, so I can't even comment on what the underwritten returns looks like. But specifically to medical office, I think I provided some color last quarter that we're unsure at this point what the long-term inflation land. And because we are unsure we are unsure of at this point to make a huge bet on an asset class that we don't know what the growth profile versus the long-term inflation looks like, right? So that's a very important point. We are finding opportunities where we think we can small opportunities where we can do value add. We are buying assets at 70%, 80% occupancy and leasing up and so that we can see the growth rate higher. But from a stabilized 95%, call it, occupied medical office with a 2.5% increase or whatever it is, the traditional medical office, which provides a good long-term, stable growth for institutional investors is not interesting for us. For that one reason. And the second reason is, it's always -- it's relative opportunities is the question, right? If that's the only thing that was available to us, will be a different conversation. We are easily picking off at low double-digit plus unlevered IRR opportunities in the senior living side assuming that we don't add much value, and I'm pretty positive we will add value. So it's just a question of relative opportunities of where we see we will today. And that's why we have no interest. By no means that suggests that we don't think it's a good deal or not a good deal. I have no idea what the deal is because I'm not engaged in it as I specifically mentioned will not because of the reasons I just pointed out to you. Yes, I'm not going to answer the first question, Josh. Obviously, on a public call, I mean, things called trade secrets that you don't want us to divulge on a public company call. But we'll say that this doesn't happen like automatically. As I've said before, we have learned. We have done a lot of transitions over the last, call it, 5, 7 years that I've been doing this, and we have learned our lessons from frankly, old school way of losing money. We have learned what we have done wrong. We have gotten better then sort of we learned how to start bleeding and then finally, we have gotten the other side of how do we -- how we can make an impact. What the prep work you need to do on systems and process and frankly, that's what John taught us, right? So it's just -- it's an evolution. It's a process that we have gotten over the last few years, and I'm very, very happy that we are there. Now from the point of view of transitions, is it the last transition, would we do 1,000 more transitions. It just depends on the performance we are trying to optimize our performance. I've said it many, many times that this is a business in our opinion, in our humble opinion. It's a business of optimizing location, product, price point and operator, right? So we'll keep optimizing it until we think that we were done. And that's kind of where we are. It's a journey I've written about that I'm willing to do even if we take short-term hits. And it appears, at least from near-term results, no guarantee of the future that we have achieved how to even mitigate that short-term hit. Rich, let me try to start that. And John, you sort of finish anything that I haven't added. So I think your conversation that you have is a reasonable for -- if you think about a long-term tenant in the middle of the market, right? So there is a -- you have to think about the customer you're talking about. We -- our rate increase is because we have sold majority of our mid-market product, our U.K. and U.S. portfolio is primarily focused on very high-end customer, very wealthy customer and the product remains incredibly affordable to them. And at that level, we haven't seen any pushback. The second point you have to consider Rich, is you -- we have never raised rates like you have seen in other asset classes, multifamily stores, others, 20%, 25%. We have never raised that, right? So just sort of rates remains high single digits, whatever, like 8%, 9%, 10% is sort of what we have done. So it's much more sustainable than you think. But put that aside, just understand, put all of those comments in the context of average length of stay, you're talking about an average length of stay of 20 months. So we might be here talking about for the third year of increase of X percent. But just understand, the person who got the first year of increase, he or she is gone, right? She's no longer in the community. So if you put all of those together, you will see that if you provide the very important point, if you provide the differentiated services at the highest level, your customer is willing to pay you. Now we are, as I've said many, many times, we're not focused on an individual number, call a RevPOR or rate, right? We're focused on very much of a delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR and that's what we are focused on. I've said that last year and the year before. And we shall see what the market gives us, right? I have no idea what the market will give us if there's a pushback, we will adjust, but we haven't seen any yet. Jim, you are correct that we are seeing turnover is coming down significantly. We are seeing that overall availability of employees who wants to be part of our business and part of the communities is increasing significantly. And we are seeing that our operating partners are getting better using technology and other resources to attract talent and keeping them in the business, right? So that sort of -- it's -- whenever you get hit by a crisis, people figure out ways to do things better, every crisis makes the business better if it survives, right? And that's what we are seeing. And what conviction do we have that RevPOR minus ExpPOR journey can continue very significantly. For a specific line item, on a specific thing, on a specific quarter, we have no idea. I said this a million times. Our goal here is not to predict the future. Our goal is to see what market gives us and do better than market. We'll see what market gives us. Yes. Mike, I'm just going to be repetitive here. I was asked this question at the NIC conference about a week ago or 10 days ago, whenever that was. I'll repeat what I said on the panel. I think if we're a debt provider in senior housing today, you have a better lot going to Vegas. And if we are an equity provider and senior housing development today, you have a better life buying lottery. I hope that tells you what my view of senior housing development is. I don't even understand why there is any start, any like more than 0 because the economics doesn't make any sense given where construction cost is, where capital cost is and where the margin of the business is. It should not have any starts and it seems like it's going there. I think any stock that you are seeing, people are still playing with other people's money, and that's coming down -- closing down pretty quickly. And I think you will continue to see it's moving down. Mike, did I miss any other part of your question? Thank you. I can't speak for other people, Mike. I will tell you that we have -- our operators -- operating partners are doing extremely well. And we are getting hit left, right and center with new operating partner who wants to be part of our story. So whether that's because they're inspired to do what John is doing, our data journey or we are trying to professionalize the business or the detailed transformation journey or they're having troubles on their own end or both, I have no idea. But I could tell you that we have literally -- I mean, it is -- we've seen really good investment opportunities. but we have never seen anything like what we are seeing today. Whether that's because of a pull or a push, I have no idea. And we are seeing operators from all parts of the country, in all three countries we do business with, is calling us to be part of it this well-capitalized, extraordinarily well capitalized platform, but also the part of -- being part of John's platform. And Ron, I've said this before, I'll repeat it again. If that's all we go back to Q4 of '19 level or pre-COVID level, I would be very, very disappointed. If you have done this in Q4 of '19, you remember, those were not the greatest days of this business, right? So we were getting it for 4-plus years at this point and through our supply cycle. That is not a high point like a lot of other businesses are and we're very disappointed that's all we get back to. I don't want to assure investors of anything. I think investors are aware of our track record, and you guys do a very good job of visiting our properties. So you can see it. The chasing the risk curve to get investments might happen when things are really, really tight. It is an exactly opposite environment, Jamie. And when those environments have occurred in the past, we were massive sellers of assets. We don't chase risk curves to get return. That's just not what we do. Now going back to your actual -- the crust of your question is, frankly speaking, the initial part of COVID, what we are noticing was sort of a lot of broken cash flows, right? Assets while 60%, 70% occupied; new development, brand new assets, 3 years, 4 years, 2-year-old assets, but broken cash flow because that's normal for a business that had breaks even at 60% occupancy and your marginal sort of return, if you will, or your marginal or incremental margins sort of go hockey stake is normal for that period of time given how much occupancy we lost during COVID to have those kind of asset; great assets, broken cash flow because of what the occupancy is and how margins work in this business. That was 2 years ago, 3 years ago, that's what sort of we were seeing. Today, we are seeing broken capital structure, assets are generating the cash flow that you should be generating at 80% occupancy, 82% occupancy where the industry is, call it, 6%, 6.5%, whatever it is, the cash flow yield -- that's not the problem. The problem is the underlying leverage, which is now so far plus 350, 400 is at 9%. That's the problem and those loans are coming to you, you are upside down on a cash flow basis and your upside down on a leverage basis. And those are the ones that are transacting today. So frankly speaking, the number of trophy buildings, number of high-quality, high high-quality buildings, which core investor zone, the core [indiscernible] zone that we have seen in last, call it, 6 months even last 4 months, I haven't seen the 4 years before that, right? And so the quality of opportunities are going up pretty significantly, but it is up to you to decide what is the quality of assets we are buying. And we give assets, you can go and visit them, and I think you will come to the same conclusion. Did I miss any part of the question? So I think, if I understand correctly, Nikhil correct me if I'm wrong, all our development starts are either fully 100% leased medical office developments that we have long-term tail or long-term contracts with our existing clients or their wellness housing development. I do not believe that we have started any senior housing development. I don't remember when was the last time we actually started the senior housing development. So because of the all reporting in the same bucket, Austin, but they're not senior housing development, there are what in the -- what we call wellness housing, which is age restricted and age targeted apartment. Yes. So the pipeline today is, as I said, I don't know, Nikhil, but it's like 80% plus would be senior housing. And mostly, I would say, equity in senior living and probably maybe 90%. But vast majority of senior living and core equity opportunities in senior living just because of the size. It's just a lot of it is in U.S. And we just closed a large transaction in Canada. So if I think about -- remember it correctly, it's almost entire -- not entirely, but majority is U.S. senior housing and there are some credit opportunities in the [indiscernible]. I don't remember any transaction or pipeline about any MOBs, but do you know anything? Okay. And stabilized yields, I would say, in the senior living today, we are targeting close to 8 on a stabilized basis and going in. I think I said last call, we are seeing sort of opportunities that starting at 6, ending at 8 and given the rise of real rates, we are seeing better than that today. Frankly, we have ratcheted our return expectations higher. So that's sort of where we are transacting. But we are not a yield buyer. We are still happy to buy 1% yield, if we think that's the right basis and the right assets. But generally speaking, those are the kind of opportunities we are seeing."

            "name": "Tim McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2023 results. The performance of our triple-net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, a balance sheet and liquidity update, and finally our updated full year 2023 outlook. Welltower reported third quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.24 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.92 per diluted share, representing 10.4% year-over-year growth, or 16.5% growth after adjusting for HHS and the year-over-year impact from changes in FX rates and higher base rates and floating rate debt. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 14.1% year-over-year. Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported [indiscernible]. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30/2023. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 3.9% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is .93x. In the quarter, we agreed to convert 11 StoryPoint assets and triple-net lease to RIDEA, which will bring their regionally focused managed portfolio up to 55 Midwestern properties in the fourth quarter. Next, same-store NOI and our long-term post acute [ph] portfolio grew 5.3% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.44x. Turning to capital activity. We closed on $1.4 billion of acquisitions and loans in the quarter, led by $618 million of senior housing operating investments. As a reminder, the Revera PSP joint venture online that was announced last quarter will close by geography in three distinct phases. The U.K portion closed in 21Q and the U.S portion close this quarter, resulting in $75 million of net investment. And the Canadian portion is expected to close by year-end. In the quarter, we continue to issue through our ATM to fund ongoing investment spend and position the balance sheet for future opportunities. We raised gross proceeds of $1.9 billion, at an average price of approximately $81 per share, allowing us to fully fund year-to-date investment activity and also extinguish $290 million of debt in the quarter. This capital activity along with continued growth across our business segments including the continued post-COVID recovery within our senior housing operating business, help drive net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 5.14x at quarter end which represents 1.8x of deleveraging versus one year ago. We expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA to settle in the mid 5s on a pro forma basis post near-term investment activity, and it continued to trend downward in future quarters, as a recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio continues to drive organic cash flow higher. Additionally, filing this intra and post-quarter capital activity, including $900 million of gross investments closed to date in October, we have a current cash and cash equivalents balance of $2 billion, along with full capacity on our $4 million revolving line of credit and $624 million in remaining expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan pay downs, representing approximately $6.6 billion in near-term available liquidity. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance. Last night we updated our previously issued full year 2023 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to a range of $0.91 to $0.95 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.59 to $3.63 per diluted share, were $3.61 per share at the midpoint. Our normalized -- updated normalized FFO per share guidance represents a $0.055 increase at the midpoint of our previously updated guidance. This increasing guidance is reflective of a $0.03 increase from higher expected full year senior housing operating NOI, a $0.035 increase from capital allocation activity, which assumes no further investment year beyond what is close the date, and this increases are partially offset by combined penny drag on increase in expected full year G&A and stronger dollar. Underlying this FFO guidance is an increased estimate of total portfolio year-over-year at the same-store NOI growth of 11.5% to 13.5%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2.5% to 3%, long-term post-acute 4% to 5%, senior housing triple-net of 1.5% to 2.5%, and finally, increased senior housing operating growth of 23% to 26%. The midpoint of which is driven by continued better-than-expected expense trends, along with revenue growth of approximately 9.8% year-over-year. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 240 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth of approximately 6.7%. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. And on your question on the seasonality in the business, you're correct. We continue to outperform the historical seasonality, and we are not seeing major differences between our transition portfolio. As Shankh mentioned, we are actually seeing very strong occupancy gains in the transition portfolio probably greater than what we've seen in the core portfolio. Yes, Ron. So we added that to deck through conversations with both investors and analysts alike. They're looking at it interpreting kind of a stabilized point to be reflective of 88% occupancy and 31% margins. When in fact, with the rent growth we've seen since fourth quarter '19, as we were ignoring that rent growth and -- or with it, we are baking in around 29% margin. So what we wanted to do is just show getting back to just the NOI level on today's rents means that you're getting to margins that are 200 basis points plus below where we were margin wise in fourth quarter '19, and what that final bar does is just shows you getting back to 88% occupancy, 31% margin in pre-COVID levels at today's third quarter '23 realized rents where NOI would be. And, Jamie, on your funding question. So in my prepared remarks, I spoke to kind of a liquidity build, and that's as of October 30. So we talked about $900 million in investments just quarter-to-date closed in October, $1 billion pipeline ahead of us about $2 billion in cash and $6.6 billion of total available liquidity to fund that."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead.\nMatthew McQueen: Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review our second quarter results and describe high-level business trends and our capital allocation activities. John will provide an update on the performance of our Senior Housing Operating and Outpatient Medical Portfolios. Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and revised guidance. Nikhil is also on the call to answer questions. We are delighted to report results, which exceeded our expectations in both our Senior Housing Business as well as Outpatient Medical Segment. Let me first dig into the Senior Housing segment. The key drivers of this business, occupancy, rate and expenses all came in better than expected this quarter, supported by accelerating demand of our product and plummeting new deliveries. From a top line perspective, our Senior Housing Operating portfolio achieved approximately 10% growth on a same-store basis and 17.8% growth on a total portfolio basis driven by another solid quarter of year-over-year occupancy growth and significant pricing power. Last quarter, I discussed with you how the strong pricing trends, along with moderating expenses, resulting in significant margin expansions that we have been all waiting for. I'm pleased to report to you that this trend intensified in the second quarter as we saw revenue per occupied room or RevPOR growth of 7.3%, coupled with just 3.5% expense per occupied room or export growth, resulting in an approximate 25% operating margin, a level not seen since the onset of the pandemic. And while that still leaves significant upside before achieving our pre-COVID NOI margin of above 30%, we expect to meaningfully exceed our pre-COVID level of profitability over time through John's build-out of the operating platform. All regions and product types contributed significantly this quarter, resulting a 24.2% NOI growth for our senior housing operating segment. While Assisted Living continues to outperform independent living driving exceptionally strong results in the U.S. and U.K., Canada is also joining the party with 17.2% NOI growth. We firmly believe that our Canadian portfolio is finally in sustainable growth mode. In fact, we're in process of significantly optimizing our Canadian business, and have recently allocated a meaningful amount of investment dollars to the region. I'll comment on both in a minute. It is also important to mention that our Seniors Apartment business continue to drive double-digit NOI growth despite the broader deceleration in the apartment industry. We have put significant effort in the last 6 years to build our Wellness Housing business which now nearly totals nearly 17,000 units, and we are pleased to see that our thesis is playing out. All in all, we have finally exceeded $1 billion of annualized net operating income in our Senior Housing segment for the first time since COVID and believe we have a ton of growth left in the tank. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I want to reiterate our core belief on how to make risk-adjusted return in Senior Housing. Unlike a lot of empirical years in the business, which either focuses on the location or the operators we believe it is a four-dimensional optimization problem of location, product, price point and operators. And we do this objectively through machine and statistical learning using our data science platform alpha. I'm delighted to inform you that we made perhaps the most significant impact in this pursuit through a mutually beneficial restructuring of our joint venture with Revera. Through a series of by sales, we materially simplified our balance sheet, and we matched specific products and locations with the right regional operators in order to achieve meaningful density in their local markets. In the U.K., we took 100% ownership of 29 premier communities, many of which are located in the Greater London market and consider some of the best care homes in the country. We transitioned this care homes from Signature to Avery and believe we have a material upside in this virtually impossible to replicate portfolio, which was 72.8% occupied at the time of transition to Avery at the beginning of June. Though two months does not make a trend, I am delighted to inform you that these communities are showing positive trends right off the bat under Lorna's leadership with current occupancy around 73.5%. In the U.S. We took 100% ownership of extremely well-located assets recently built by Sunrise in high barriers to entry submarket in the West Coast, East Coast and South Florida at a favorable basis and sold a minority interest in 12 other assets. We also moved management of 28 incredibly well-located California buildings to Oakmont, the California communities were 77% occupied when they are transitioned to Oakmont at the end of June. I fully expect this portfolio to be materially additive to our growth in 2024 under Courtney's leadership. As you can see in the case study on the Page 32 of our business update, highlighting previous Oakmont transitions in California. Courtney's team has taken occupancy from 64% to 90% in 2 years at these committees. Though this occupancy has far surpassed their previous high occupancy of 86% in 2016, I fully expect these communities will hit mid-90s occupancy in near future. All things being equal, that stabilization path should be faster for the most recent portfolio of 28 communities that they have assumed the management of. If not for the lessons learned previously, it will be for a higher starting point. And just after four weeks of operations under Oakmont, these properties are on a path to achieve approximately 100 basis points of occupancy growth in first month and are showing positive NOI traction in NOI out of the gate. And finally, Canada, perhaps the most exciting part of this yearlong effort to optimize our portfolio. Through though there is a multidimensional value creation opportunity in this effort I'm delighted to inform you that we are launching a new platform with our partner, Matthew Deguet in English-speaking Canada. As you know, Cogier, under Matthew's leadership is one of the best operators in the business, and we cannot be more excited about launching our first operating platform in a post PLR world. We will double down -- we'll double down on our investments in these communities, dramatically enhanced resident experience and materially improve employee experience, resulting in exciting long-term carrier growth opportunity. I predict this operating JV will witness rapid growth in very near future. The series of steps, which is known as Project Transformer inside Welltower is one of the most complex yet value-accretive transactions we have ever done. Under Eric Chung's leadership in Canada and U.K. and Ras Simon's leadership in the U.S., this multidimensional project will truly transform our company in the next chapter of its evolution. This transaction marks the conclusion of our 7-year journey of contract modernization as virtually all of our contracts are now in RIDEA 30 and RIDEA 40 structure. I cannot emphasize enough how important this milestone is for our farm as we have now full alignment with all of our key senior housing operating partners. We think or swim together. To continue this team of capital allocation, the favorable transaction environment that I described to you last quarter has resulted in an incredibly active summer for us. We currently have approximately $2.3 billion of deals under contract in 26 different off-market, privately negotiated transactions. Opportunities within Senior Housing segment represents the bulk of these transactions with approximately $2 billion of deals comprised of 8,900 units across all three regions. We estimate our investment in these deals to be very attractive, 30% to 40% discount of today's replacement cost, with accretive in-place cash flow and significant growth potential. While I don't like to get into individual transactions, I would like to highlight a transaction in Canada with our partner, Cogier. We're recapping Cogier's existing institutional investor at Propco in highly desirable SaaS portfolio, and Matthew is investing is equity going forward. This CAD 935 million transaction of both recently built and attractive stable assets are a testament to the power of our relationship in this industry. Eddie and his team has been working tirelessly over the past two years on this transaction, and we're delighted to inform you that we signed a definite documents three weeks ago. Additionally, following the completion of this deal and others under recently in a contract, we have achieved another company milestone having closed or signed over $11 billion of transactions since our pivot to offense in fourth quarter of 2020. But we are busier than ever with a robust feasible and actionable pipeline of opportunities that we're underwriting right now. Again, heavily senior housing, but we are also seeing some outpatient medical and skilled nursing opportunities up and down the capital stack. All of which we expect -- all of which we expect to keep us very busy for the rest of the year. Our deal teams didn't get much of summer vacation and looks like they won't get much of a Christmas holiday either as many of these deals will close in Q4. As I described last quarter, both debt and equity capital continue to rapidly evaporate from the commercial real estate space, we're getting hits left, right and center from counterparties who truly appreciate our handshake approach to the business where we can bring both cash and operator to the closing table. We're seeing that the banks are no longer willing to kick the can down the road and in fact, are showing willingness to sell their loan books partially or completely. A handful of these transactions have taken place and many more are brewing. The increased capital requirement directive from the regulators last week will only intensify this trend, and we are ready to help banks release their capital as they execute their other strategic priorities. Nikhil and Tim's cell phone number has been on full display in our full page ad of the American Banker Magazine since the summer of 2020. Please give them a call. I promise you they will respond within hours, not days as it is customarily acceptable standard in Senior Housing Industry. I predict Welltower will play a meaningful role in helping to recapitalize distressed commercial rest loan portfolios that fall within our circle of competence. And lastly, at the risk of stealing Tim's thunder, I would like to point out that our meaningful strengthening of our balance sheet over the last few quarters. Just in the last 1 year, our leverage has fallen from high 60s to mid-5s through a combination of outsized organic growth and prudent capital allocation activity. Were now armed with approximately $7.6 billion of near-term liquidity to address upcoming debt maturities and fund our various capital deployment opportunities. In summary, we have never been more delighted with our operating performance and have never been busier on the deal side and build-out of our platform. While no one knows what future may hold, my partners and I remain as optimistic as they were on the future of our business. And with that, I'll hand the call over to John.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh. Another great quarter like last quarter, just better. Our total portfolio generated a 12.7% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, led by the Senior Housing Operating portfolio with 24.2% year-over-year growth. These great results speak for themselves, so I will provide limited color on the quarterly results and focus more on the future, including the billions of dollars in value that are being unlocked as a result of the management transition we announced last night. First, on results. The medical office portfolio's second quarter same-store NOI growth was 3.2% over the prior year's quarter. Same-store occupancy was 95.1% while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at 92.5%, highlighting the stability of the relationships as well as the quality of the portfolio. The 24.2% second quarter NOI increase in our same-store Senior Housing Operating portfolio was a function of 9.9% revenue growth driven by the combination of 7.3% RevPOR growth and 190 basis points of occupancy. As a note, this number excludes the U.K. communities, we recently transitioned to Avery that were originally included in the guidance. These communities grew occupancy at 9% year-over-year. So including the communities, our total portfolio same-store occupancy growth would have been 20 basis points higher at 210 basis points. Though exclusion of these communities has a negative impact on our annual occupancy growth debt, we maintained our guidance given the market strength we are seeing. Additionally, expenses remain in control, coming in at 5.8% for the quarter over the comparable prior year's quarter. More specifically, the pressure we experienced from a tight labor market over the past two years and broad-based use of agency has continued to abate. In fact, agency expense as a percentage of total compensation for the quarter declined substantially from nearly 8% in the first quarter of last year. This outstanding revenue growth and expense growth led to substantial margin expansion of 290 basis points. All three regions continue to show strong same-store revenue growth, starting with Canada at 8.1% and in the U.S. and U.K. growing at 9.9% and 13%, respectively. The strong revenue growth in each region, combined with the expense controls have led to fantastic NOI growth in Canada, the U.S. and U.K. of 17.2%, 24.8% and 38.2%, respectively. On to the management transition. We're very excited about the value being unlocked as a result of these transitions. Having the right manager for an asset is critical. The fact that Shankh has repeatedly stated, these transitions accomplish that objective while improving each operator's concentration of Welltower assets in various markets, a key factor to operational excellence. Concentration brings increased effectiveness and increased efficiency through improving the value proposition for customers in numerous ways, including greater choices and frictionless transfers, improving the value proposition for employees, including improved training and career paths and improving the efficiency of vendors operating at multiple sites, translating into increased NOI growth. The benefits of increased concentration, which show up in margins have been proven many times over with the multifamily REITs. Welltower is now beginning to harvest those benefits. We continue to make substantial progress on our platform and the related rollout. To provide you with one example, one of our operators with over 50 properties is fully and rapidly transitioning to our platform over the coming three to 12 months. We've been working with them over the past year via our aggressive asset management program, enabling them to increase occupancy over 600 basis points in the last year. As I've mentioned in the past, the platform isn't only about technology. It's about people, processes, data and technology. After seeing the amazing improvement in occupancy in the 12 months related to our focus on processes, they are fully embracing our entire platform. I'm grateful that they see the opportunity and benefit of pursuing operational excellence, and I appreciate their partnership. Additionally, as Shankh mentioned, we are partnering with Cogier, the premier Canadian operator for the management of many of our Canadian transition assets. The best outcomes are achieved by working with the best people and the best operators. I'm very excited about the opportunity to partner with Matthew and Frederic and their team at Cogier on this new venture and the incredible value we will create for our investors. More to come in the coming year. I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\nTim McHugh: Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2023 results. performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update, and finally, our updated full year 2023 outlook. Welltower reported second quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.20 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.90 per diluted share, representing 4% year-over-year growth or 16% growth after adjusting for HHS and the year-over-year impact from a stronger dollar and higher base rates on floating rate debt. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 12.7% year-over-year. Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter, in our Senior Housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 3.1% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.88x in the quarter. Next, Same-store NOI and long-term postcute portfolio grew 6.1% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.48x. Turning capital activity in the quarter. In May, we issued a $1.035 billion convertible note due in 2028. The note bears interest at 2.75% rate and is convertible at $95.41 per share. We intend to use the proceeds from the note to address our 2024 unsecured maturities coming due in the first quarter of next year. In addition to our convert offering, we continue to issue through our ATM to fund ongoing investment spend, raising gross proceeds of $1.76 billion since the beginning of the second quarter. This capital activity, along with continued growth across our business segments, including the solid post-COVID recovery within our Senior Housing Operating business helped drive net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 5.62x at quarter end, which represents well over a turn of deleveraging versus 1 year ago. As Shankh mentioned, we are seeing ample opportunity to invest our large cash balance. But even so, we expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA to remain below 6x on a pro forma basis post deployment and to continue to move lower as the senior housing operating portfolio continues to drive organic cash flow higher. Additionally, filing this intra and post-quarter capital activity, we have a current cash and cash equivalent balance $2.7 billion. Along with full capacity on our $4 billion revolving line of credit and $910 million of remaining expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan paydowns, representing approximately $7.6 billion in near-term gross available liquidity and $6.3 billion of liquidity when netting for the $1.35 billion of unsecured maturities we have in 2024. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance. Last night, we updated our previously issued full year 2023 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to a range of $0.73 to $0.84 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.48 to $3.59 per diluted share or $3.535 at the midpoint. Our updated normalized FFO guidance represents a $0.04 increase at the midpoint from our previously issued guidance. This increase in guidance is reflective of a $0.02 increase in expected full year senior housing operating NOI, a $0.02 increase from capital allocation activity, which assumes no further investments in the year beyond what has been announced to date and $0.01 from HHS and other out-of-period government grants received in 2Q. And these increases are offset by a $0.01 increase in expected full year G&A and interest expense. Underlying this FFO guidance is an increased estimate of total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 10% to 13%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute, 3% to 4%; senior housing triple net, 1% to 3%; and finally, increased Senior Housing Operating growth of 20% to 25% year-over-year. The midpoint of which is driven by continued better-than-expected expense trends, along with revenue growth of approximately 9.7%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 230 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth of approximately 6.7%. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. We're currently living in an uncertain macroeconomic environment where the outlook is getting marked here by the day. One day it is sunny and the next day, all people see our dark clouds. The Federal Reserve appears to be resolute in its fight against inflation and seems far less inclined to come to rescue private and public markets as most participants like to hope for. Against this backdrop, we continue to take a very balanced approach as we consider both growth opportunities and risk environment. On one hand, we remain prudent and continue our deleveraging through rapid organic growth and appropriate capitalization of our external growth opportunities. On the other hand, we're aggressively putting capital to work, though where ever more price and return conscious. We cannot predict the macro, but we can predict with a high degree of confidence what is likely to come on a micro basis. And that is while we are seeing growth rolling over in most asset classes, including most other real estate property types, both the demand and supply outlook are getting better for us as we look into '24 and '25. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, I believe we're at the beginning of multiyear double-digit NOI growth cycle for our business, resulting from a long runway of occupancy gains rate growth and operating margin expansion. At Project Transformers, along with the relentless optimization of our operating platform, the impact which will start to show up in next year and the constraint reloading of our external growth and or perhaps the growth Bazooka at this point, through a highly targeted deals, you get an ideal setup for accelerating earnings and cash flow growth as we look into next year. With that, we'll open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJonathan Hughes : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time. I wanted to ask about the recent transitions. What's changed between how you're able to implement transitions today that minimize the economic impact versus prior ones in previous years that typically came with some lost income. Are these operators taking over just that much more sophisticated. Do they have more support from you? Is some of it driven by the very different supply-demand backdrop I'm just trying to better understand how to interpret the term transition because previously that came with some near-term negative impact, but now that seems to be a positive.\nJohn Burkart: It's a really good question. A lot of it really is what I would call relates to leadership, and that's because a lot of a transition relates to execution. So having the outstanding partners that we have, working together as a team to anticipate opportunities and issues, connecting with people. All these issues, all these items are about people, so connecting with the people, the sites and finding it all out flawlessly and executing flawless is what's changing that game. There's a lot of details involved each of these -- in each of these situations, there's literally transition teams that are 24/7 focus 100% on all the details and then there's operating teams that are focused on the operations. So a lot of work, but ultimately, it's leadership that changes that game.\nShankh Mitra: Jonathan, we are not going to give away how we do these things today versus what we happened before. But I have mentioned in previous calls, that we have learned finally under John's leadership, how to do these transitions, right? But that's our proprietary obviously, you're seeing [indiscernible] that's showing up in the results, but we're not going to give away our secrets obviously on this call.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Connor Siversky with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nConnor Siversky : Good morning out there. I appreciate the color on the prepared remarks and congratulations on crossing that $1 billion threshold. It's quite an achievement. Just want to switch gears to Integra. Wondering if you could provide an update on the portfolio transition process. specifically looking for color on how cash flow metrics within the portfolio are trending and perhaps as a bonus, some perspective on access and retention of labor within those skilled nursing assets?\nNikhil Chaudhri: Connor, it's Nikhil. I'll take this one. So look, we're pretty pleased with the performance that we've seen so far. If you remember, there were a total of about 147 buildings that were being transitioned over of those 133 have already been transitioned to the new operators. And the results we're seeing are very encouraging. So if you look at those 133 buildings for the three months prior to the transition, those buildings on an EBITDA basis were losing roughly $90 million a year. three months later, first quarter of this year, and those same buildings that are making positive $70 million. Still a lot more work to be done, but the rapid turnaround has been really encouraging to see. And on the second part of your question, on labor, all the numbers, all the metrics seem to be following the broader trends we're seeing in our broader business that the labor situation is getting better by the day.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. \nSteven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the results as well. Yes. No, it's hard to answer for the whole industry. Your results are obviously incredibly strong in Senior Housing, but there are some pockets from some other players where maybe the occupancy was slowing down a little bit in the quarter. Just curious if you have any high-level thoughts on maybe why your results were separate from maybe some other players that did see occupancy decelerating a little bit? Is there any signs of price sensitivity in any pockets of the market? Just curious of your thoughts around that.\nShankh Mitra: Yes. Steven, we're not going to get into what other players might or might not be seeing. We can only tell you what we are seeing, we're seeing a very strong start of the spring selling -- summer selling season. If you think about how this business works, Obviously, the activities pick up very significantly, sales start to happen in sort of second quarter. That translated into third quarter, early fourth quarter occupancy gains. That's seasonally how the business works. And we have seen some significant traction this summer as we're moving into third quarter. We're seeing pricing trends getting better, occupancy trends getting better. So I really have no idea what you're referring to. But I can tell you that we're very pleased with second quarter occupancy, right? John just mentioned, our reported same-store numbers are impacted by the removal of the U.K. assets. But we're very, very pleased with what we have seen. We don't know what future holds. I'm not going to try to sit here and guess what the future will look like. But the promise we made to you and our owners is very simple. We will get more than what the market gives us, right? That's our execution. And we're very pleased with what we have seen so far. If you look at the demand supply, trends are getting better every day. It's not the other way around.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Michael Griffin, your line is open. [technical error] Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt : I just want to understand. So with will no longer having an investment in the Sunrise management company and sort of dissolving the joint venture relationship with Revera are the remaining Sunrise-operated assets still revenue-based management contracts? And if so, I guess, how does that change the owner-operator relationship moving forward? And is there more restructuring to do over time with that portfolio specifically?\nShankh Mitra: The answer is the Sunrise contracts are not what you described. We restructured a contract with Sunrise in 2011 -- 2021, sorry 2021 and Sunrise is fully aligned with us with the principal philosophy that we're seeing ensuing together. So many years ago, I have described that our fundamental philosophy under my team's leadership has changed from owning part of management company's equity to contract. That's what we have described. And as you can see in one of the slides we have described a 7-year long effort to transform all our contracts from sort of top line focused contracts to bottom line focus contract where we think and swim together and virtually all of our contracts are there today. So that sort of hopefully gives you an answer to your question. We do not believe and we haven't done in sort of having influence on our communities through owning part of management contract part of management companies. We do it through our contracts, and that's where you can see in the evolution of those contracts.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. \nMichael Carroll : Yep. Thanks. I wanted to touch on the Welltower Cogier, I guess, operating relationship. I mean how is that relationship going to work? And how should we think about the growth of that platform? I mean when you're growing into new markets, are you going to be doing that with Cogier or another operator? Or would you be doing that yourself?\nJohn Burkart: The -- as far as for how it works, I'll talk about that and I'll let Shankh talk about the expansion. But as far as how it works, it's working fantastic right now. I'm partnering up with Frederic and we're working together really on the vision, the strategy and oversight. Cogier is handling all the execution on the daily decisions and all that type of stuff. And what you have is a very synergistic team, we're both extremely excited about re-envisioning the opportunity to reposition these assets. And so we're excited about what we're creating there. But I won't be involved in the daily aspects of it. I -- there a fantastic operator. There's no value there. I'm focused to get on the bigger picture items.\nShankh Mitra: From an expansion standpoint, my comment that I made that this joint venture will have rapid growth. That comment obviously means that you will see that we're expanding where we're very excited about Canada and doing lots of expansions in Canada that will come. We're focused -- you think about it in a very simplistic terms, this platform that we're launching, we'll be focused on English-speaking Canada. Cogier has a tremendous brand in the French Canada and we'll watch this together from that. Now what we do in U.S. is a different conversation. Just understand that our PLR is on independent living and majority of our exposure in independent living is in Canada. That's why we're starting this.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Your line is open. \nVikram Malhotra : Thanks for the question. Maybe Shankh or Tim, you talked a lot about stress in Senior Housing referencing obviously, Fannie Mae delinquencies. I'm wondering if you can just -- and then you outlined the $30 billion decade opportunity. I'm wondering if you can give us more color on kind of how you think about the funnel in terms of all these distressed opportunities coming whether it's operational or balance sheet distress. But how do you think about the funnel and filtering it down to what is actually actionable for Welltower, whether it is analytics-driven or strategic driven. And then just combining that actionable pipeline, you mentioned with sort of the long-term earnings power. You talked about double-digit NOI growth, but are there any [indiscernible] leaves you can share on kind of the earnings, the underlying AFFO is likely to grow over a longer time period?\nShankh Mitra: Let me see if I can answer your 5-part question. Likely, I will forget some pieces. So be -- frankly speaking, if we just take a step back and understand what's happening the stress that we see are not cash flow driven, the stress that we see are balance sheet driven. And the balance sheet driven comes in many forms. There's a significant lack of equity and debt capital today. In fact, when we say the debt market is functioning not functioning, most people assume that sort of the mid market remains, and it's not growing, it remains fairly flat. That's not what's happening today. The debt market -- Banks are under significant pressure from regulators to show up capital, which means they are actually selling they're shrinking, right? Then you add on top of that, a lot of the construction that happened between '15 and '19 time frame, they're on SOFR based loans, they're on LIBOR-based loans. And given how much that base rates have gone up, right, 500-plus basis points just in the last 12 months, is putting tremendous pressure. You think about it where a LIBOR plus 350, 400 it today, you are at 8%, 9% rate. And you just cannot -- these capital structures were not envisioned for that kind of rate environment. So you've got massive pressure on that. Then you see even people who put float caps, a lot of these floater caps are coming off second half of this year and next year. So and you add insert injury, majority of Senior Housing loans actually come with personal guarantees. So I can go on and on and on, but that's not the point. What you're asking is, is very simply, these assets are not stressed, the balance sheet behind assets are stressed. And we are ready and willing. And to do these executions, you just -- you need two things. You need cash because that we're not showing up with subject to financing, we're showing up with cash. And the other very important thing is operating partners. You need both to solve people's problems, their balance sheet problems and the go-forward problems, and that's why we're doing it. Now we're not going to get into on this call a multiyear sort of a earnings growth projection. As Tim has alluded to, DCR's earnings growth is significantly impacted by, obviously, our floating rate debt as well as strong dollar. You know what those numbers are. We have pointed out unless you believe rates are going from 5.5% to 11% again, you should not have those kind of impacts going forward, right? So from the NOI growth, with that, you can figure it out what that looks like. But from my comment, you can figure out that we're very excited about an accelerating earnings and cash flow growth trajectory as we look into '24.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. \nNicholas Yulico : Thanks. Good morning. In terms of the $2.3 billion of investments post second quarter. I know you talked about the discount to replacement costs and some of the IRR expectations. But can you just give us a feel for what these look like on a first year cap rate basis and then stabilized yield potential going on a couple of years. And any comments on occupancy or other drivers that are creating some of the NOI upside for the assets?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So I'll start with the last. Obviously, these assets have both occupancy and significant margin growth potential. With the occupancy, obviously, as you understand sort of the flow-through mechanics of this business. Majority of the profitability in the business is after, call it, 80% occupancy because there's very significant fixed costs. So incremental margin, if you will, after 80% occupancy is, call it, 70-plus margin. And then as you get closer to 90% or 90% -- about 90% occupancy we're at kind of 90 -- your incremental margins approach 90%, right? So majority of the profitable hockey stick profitability in that kind of 10% plus occupancy range. So that's what's the driver of the growth that we think baked into this. So we like buying low basis, lower occupancy portfolio. That's sort of what we do. We do not like to pay a cash flow on a highly occupied high NOI, which drives into obviously results into high-basis assets. We just don't do that here. That sort of gives you the answer to the second question, right? Let's just talk about the first question, which is a very simple question. You should assume a year 1 in this batch of acquisitions, roughly around 6%, going into 7 plus, following the math I just described to you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore. Your line is open.\nJim Kammert: Thinking at the business update on the Revera transition Pages 9 and 10, could you just provide what is a reasonable time line for that NOI capture and what capital you might have to spend to capture that NOI delta?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So we have never gotten into the time line of our bridge. This is part of our bridge, obviously. We'll leave you to determine when we think stable occupancy will come. And so that's part of your sort of answer to the first part of your question. The second part, I just want to point out one thing is what we are suggesting here is that $120 million we mentioned is part of the $414 million or so of the bridge. So that's what it is. If we thought that's all we're going to get, we would not have done it. In other words, the bridge, the fundamental tenet of the bridge is we go back to fourth quarter of '19 occupancy. If you look at Page 32, which sort of shows one of these transitions we have done, not only the first 6 that we gave it to Oakmont, exactly two years ago, today is actually exactly two years. These occupancies are above 90% where the prior peak was 86% and change in 2016. That gives you and I expect -- fully expect to believe they will be in mid-90s in the next few months. That gives you a sense of where we think the occupancy will go and what the margin will follow. For example, let me give you another example, the Canadian example. The Revera properties that we mentioned, I believe one of the pages said is like low sites occupancy. That portfolio is sitting at 23% margin, give or take today. I mentioned to you that Cogier runs in their Canadian portfolio of 40-plus person margin, that sort of gives you a sense of where we think that these properties can go. 120 is part of the bridge that shows you 414. But if we thought 120 is all we're going to get, we would not have done it.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria : Shankh or John, maybe if you could just talk about what you're thinking or seeing or you're discussing with your operators with regard to the rent bumps either this fall or next year? I'm not sure if it's too early, but just curious on your thoughts on how that could change relative to last year's pretty sizable increases in a different inflationary environment?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So one, we're not going to sit here and try to predict what will happen 6 months from now, but I expect a very strong rate environment in 2024 as well. What will that be exactly depends on a lot of things, but I have no reason to believe in a better environment of demand and supply, we're not going to have a strong pricing power. But we'll see when we get there.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.\nJohn Pawlowski : A question on funding going forward. I know funding secured for the deals you've announced that are under contract. I'm just curious how -- what you think the optimal funding mix, the next $1 billion of external growth is?\nTim McHugh: Yes, John, I think consistent with how we've been in the past, funding is going to be from the most attractive source you have, right? And whether that's public equity, debt or disposition proceeds, we'll continue to openly fund as we move along. So we would just hesitate to try to provide you forward guidance on that. It will be under made at whatever topmost time that we're funding.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ronald Camden with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRonald Kamdem : Just can we dig into the expenses a little bit, what just seems is trending better than expected. Historically, it's been on the labor, that's a surprise. But going forward, maybe can you talk about what are the biggest drivers that you're going to be looking at? And what areas do you have conviction in and where could you be surprised up or down?\nShankh Mitra: We have a lot of conviction on both continue to optimizing the labor side and other expenses. I would rather not get into what drivers you might get in the next 6 months versus 12 months, but I will point out that the utility side, the energy side, last fall was very, very significant hit.  So at least as we lap going into '24, we should get from a year-over-year perspective and frankly, energy prices have come down, we should see some benefit. But we're not going to sit here and just try to predict what might or not might play out on, but I will say that you have heard from our prepared remarks that we're feeling very good about continued margin expansion, not just sort of going back to pre-COVID, but we do think that John will take these margins much higher over a period of time.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Mueller : For the loan portfolio, loan assets that you're looking at, should we be thinking of those as being straight debt deal at discounts or just more specifically targeted toward portfolios where you can ultimately get to the real estate?\nShankh Mitra: So first thing is, I'm going to elaborate again. I think I've done it before. I'm just going to tell you, we don't lend against assets that we don't want to own at the last dollar basis that we -- our loan sits at. So that's sort of the fundamental premise that we have. Having said that, different transactions come in different forms, were here to help people provide -- were here to help owners and borrowers with liquidity that they might need or institutions which owns already owns those loans. How different transaction will play out, whether it's an existing loan or we're coming in to provide capital, I don't know that yet. We are -- our focus investors and simple debt yield will determine where we get to, but just a coupon is less interesting for us. We'll start, obviously, probably we're thinking about how we can get equity returns. If we're just going in and 100 on the dollar when we are actually loaning into a situation that doesn't have debt. Or if it is existing debt, we're going to have to think about what type of discount gives us the right return, assuming we get our money back. And if we don't, we're comfortable owning the asset at that last dollar basis, philosophically, that's what we think about it. Every transaction is different.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein : John, last quarter, you mentioned you had rolled out a pilot program for drawing in leads to a couple of senior housing properties. And I think if I recall correctly, I guess the biggest challenge was just the sheer volume of leads. What's the latest on that pilot program? And maybe just how is that impacting pricing power?\nJohn Burkart: Yes. So the comments, if I remember correctly myself, was the COO called us and it was funny to me said, gee, you've done so much to increase leads. We're struggling in getting our hands around that in that pilot, and they definitely did get their hands around it. It's a staffing opportunity there. We're continuing to roll out -- move from pilot to rollout, and so we're pressing forward. And as I mentioned, we have another operator that's jumping on 100% on board and we'll be pushing forward their platform up with our venture up in Canada as well. We're seeing terrific results through the marketing efforts that we're applying. And what that does to pricing power, in essence, our focus is on maximizing NOI, right? So we're looking at combination between price, between occupancy, recognizing that occupancy comes with a price. So yes, we will push a little bit more on price and find the right point there, but it's what's providing our outstanding results.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi.\nMichael Griffin : I know you've talked in the past about redevelopment industries you've undertaken at some properties. I'm just curious if you can give us an update on these redevelopments kind of what the expectation for growth in this platform is going forward? And any commentary there would be helpful.\nJohn Burkart: Yes. That's really a great question. And I think it's something that is -- we haven't talked about it that much. And the reality that I think it's completely underappreciated as far as the future earnings potential of this portfolio. You look at our portfolio is roughly 20 years old in the Senior Housing business, and that is the sweet spot for renovation. It's one I typically call fluff and buff because what you have is your infrastructure plumbing and roofing this kind of stuff is in typically good order. But what isn't in good order is the first impressions, amenities, units and that type of thing. So I have been aggressively building out a renovation team in-house team at Welltower experts, and we are launching -- what you'll see is we'll start launching on pretty massive renovation programs, West Coast, East Coast, Canada, U.K., all these things are lining up, and we're at the beginning stages but the impact should be very positive on NOI for certain, obviously, increasing occupancy first and occupancy and rate. The value proposition opportunity is significant. I've walked numerous properties in all the regions. And it's clearly a very big opportunity and having the expertise that we're bringing to the table will truly change the game in renovation of senior housing.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski : John, just curious within your U.S. portfolio, can you give me a sense for how the shortfall in independent living occupancy versus 2019 compares to the gap in your assisted living portfolio?\nShankh Mitra: We'll have to get back to you on that. But generally speaking, you have assisted living fail further. So obviously, it has longer to come back. Independent living didn't fall that far, but it has been coming back slowly sort of slowly. But specifically, our portfolio has changed materially since '19 as far as Independent Living and Assisted Living is concerned. So we will have to those numbers and get back to you. But clearly speaking, I will tell you, the Assisted Living continue to outperform, we are seeing Independent Living is starting to come back. And frankly speaking, Independent Living for us, like 75%, 80% is Canada, and it's just sort of more of a -- I don't know it's a product comment or it's sort of it's a country comment, right? We're seeing very strong performance finally coming out of Canada, and we expect that will get better as all this sort of optimization that we're talking about around the [indiscernible] will play out but I cannot tell you, John, is it that if a product thing or just a country thing because majority of Independent portfolio sits in Canada.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Connor, it's Nikhil. I'll take this one. So look, we're pretty pleased with the performance that we've seen so far. If you remember, there were a total of about 147 buildings that were being transitioned over of those 133 have already been transitioned to the new operators. And the results we're seeing are very encouraging. So if you look at those 133 buildings for the three months prior to the transition, those buildings on an EBITDA basis were losing roughly $90 million a year. three months later, first quarter of this year, and those same buildings that are making positive $70 million. Still a lot more work to be done, but the rapid turnaround has been really encouraging to see. And on the second part of your question, on labor, all the numbers, all the metrics seem to be following the broader trends we're seeing in our broader business that the labor situation is getting better by the day."

            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. Another great quarter like last quarter, just better. Our total portfolio generated a 12.7% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, led by the Senior Housing Operating portfolio with 24.2% year-over-year growth. These great results speak for themselves, so I will provide limited color on the quarterly results and focus more on the future, including the billions of dollars in value that are being unlocked as a result of the management transition we announced last night. First, on results. The medical office portfolio's second quarter same-store NOI growth was 3.2% over the prior year's quarter. Same-store occupancy was 95.1% while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at 92.5%, highlighting the stability of the relationships as well as the quality of the portfolio. The 24.2% second quarter NOI increase in our same-store Senior Housing Operating portfolio was a function of 9.9% revenue growth driven by the combination of 7.3% RevPOR growth and 190 basis points of occupancy. As a note, this number excludes the U.K. communities, we recently transitioned to Avery that were originally included in the guidance. These communities grew occupancy at 9% year-over-year. So including the communities, our total portfolio same-store occupancy growth would have been 20 basis points higher at 210 basis points. Though exclusion of these communities has a negative impact on our annual occupancy growth debt, we maintained our guidance given the market strength we are seeing. Additionally, expenses remain in control, coming in at 5.8% for the quarter over the comparable prior year's quarter. More specifically, the pressure we experienced from a tight labor market over the past two years and broad-based use of agency has continued to abate. In fact, agency expense as a percentage of total compensation for the quarter declined substantially from nearly 8% in the first quarter of last year. This outstanding revenue growth and expense growth led to substantial margin expansion of 290 basis points. All three regions continue to show strong same-store revenue growth, starting with Canada at 8.1% and in the U.S. and U.K. growing at 9.9% and 13%, respectively. The strong revenue growth in each region, combined with the expense controls have led to fantastic NOI growth in Canada, the U.S. and U.K. of 17.2%, 24.8% and 38.2%, respectively. On to the management transition. We're very excited about the value being unlocked as a result of these transitions. Having the right manager for an asset is critical. The fact that Shankh has repeatedly stated, these transitions accomplish that objective while improving each operator's concentration of Welltower assets in various markets, a key factor to operational excellence. Concentration brings increased effectiveness and increased efficiency through improving the value proposition for customers in numerous ways, including greater choices and frictionless transfers, improving the value proposition for employees, including improved training and career paths and improving the efficiency of vendors operating at multiple sites, translating into increased NOI growth. The benefits of increased concentration, which show up in margins have been proven many times over with the multifamily REITs. Welltower is now beginning to harvest those benefits. We continue to make substantial progress on our platform and the related rollout. To provide you with one example, one of our operators with over 50 properties is fully and rapidly transitioning to our platform over the coming three to 12 months. We've been working with them over the past year via our aggressive asset management program, enabling them to increase occupancy over 600 basis points in the last year. As I've mentioned in the past, the platform isn't only about technology. It's about people, processes, data and technology. After seeing the amazing improvement in occupancy in the 12 months related to our focus on processes, they are fully embracing our entire platform. I'm grateful that they see the opportunity and benefit of pursuing operational excellence, and I appreciate their partnership. Additionally, as Shankh mentioned, we are partnering with Cogier, the premier Canadian operator for the management of many of our Canadian transition assets. The best outcomes are achieved by working with the best people and the best operators. I'm very excited about the opportunity to partner with Matthew and Frederic and their team at Cogier on this new venture and the incredible value we will create for our investors. More to come in the coming year. I'll now turn the call over to Tim. It's a really good question. A lot of it really is what I would call relates to leadership, and that's because a lot of a transition relates to execution. So having the outstanding partners that we have, working together as a team to anticipate opportunities and issues, connecting with people. All these issues, all these items are about people, so connecting with the people, the sites and finding it all out flawlessly and executing flawless is what's changing that game. There's a lot of details involved each of these -- in each of these situations, there's literally transition teams that are 24/7 focus 100% on all the details and then there's operating teams that are focused on the operations. So a lot of work, but ultimately, it's leadership that changes that game. The -- as far as for how it works, I'll talk about that and I'll let Shankh talk about the expansion. But as far as how it works, it's working fantastic right now. I'm partnering up with Frederic and we're working together really on the vision, the strategy and oversight. Cogier is handling all the execution on the daily decisions and all that type of stuff. And what you have is a very synergistic team, we're both extremely excited about re-envisioning the opportunity to reposition these assets. And so we're excited about what we're creating there. But I won't be involved in the daily aspects of it. I -- there a fantastic operator. There's no value there. I'm focused to get on the bigger picture items. Yes. So the comments, if I remember correctly myself, was the COO called us and it was funny to me said, gee, you've done so much to increase leads. We're struggling in getting our hands around that in that pilot, and they definitely did get their hands around it. It's a staffing opportunity there. We're continuing to roll out -- move from pilot to rollout, and so we're pressing forward. And as I mentioned, we have another operator that's jumping on 100% on board and we'll be pushing forward their platform up with our venture up in Canada as well. We're seeing terrific results through the marketing efforts that we're applying. And what that does to pricing power, in essence, our focus is on maximizing NOI, right? So we're looking at combination between price, between occupancy, recognizing that occupancy comes with a price. So yes, we will push a little bit more on price and find the right point there, but it's what's providing our outstanding results. Yes. That's really a great question. And I think it's something that is -- we haven't talked about it that much. And the reality that I think it's completely underappreciated as far as the future earnings potential of this portfolio. You look at our portfolio is roughly 20 years old in the Senior Housing business, and that is the sweet spot for renovation. It's one I typically call fluff and buff because what you have is your infrastructure plumbing and roofing this kind of stuff is in typically good order. But what isn't in good order is the first impressions, amenities, units and that type of thing. So I have been aggressively building out a renovation team in-house team at Welltower experts, and we are launching -- what you'll see is we'll start launching on pretty massive renovation programs, West Coast, East Coast, Canada, U.K., all these things are lining up, and we're at the beginning stages but the impact should be very positive on NOI for certain, obviously, increasing occupancy first and occupancy and rate. The value proposition opportunity is significant. I've walked numerous properties in all the regions. And it's clearly a very big opportunity and having the expertise that we're bringing to the table will truly change the game in renovation of senior housing."

            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review our second quarter results and describe high-level business trends and our capital allocation activities. John will provide an update on the performance of our Senior Housing Operating and Outpatient Medical Portfolios. Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and revised guidance. Nikhil is also on the call to answer questions. We are delighted to report results, which exceeded our expectations in both our Senior Housing Business as well as Outpatient Medical Segment. Let me first dig into the Senior Housing segment. The key drivers of this business, occupancy, rate and expenses all came in better than expected this quarter, supported by accelerating demand of our product and plummeting new deliveries. From a top line perspective, our Senior Housing Operating portfolio achieved approximately 10% growth on a same-store basis and 17.8% growth on a total portfolio basis driven by another solid quarter of year-over-year occupancy growth and significant pricing power. Last quarter, I discussed with you how the strong pricing trends, along with moderating expenses, resulting in significant margin expansions that we have been all waiting for. I'm pleased to report to you that this trend intensified in the second quarter as we saw revenue per occupied room or RevPOR growth of 7.3%, coupled with just 3.5% expense per occupied room or export growth, resulting in an approximate 25% operating margin, a level not seen since the onset of the pandemic. And while that still leaves significant upside before achieving our pre-COVID NOI margin of above 30%, we expect to meaningfully exceed our pre-COVID level of profitability over time through John's build-out of the operating platform. All regions and product types contributed significantly this quarter, resulting a 24.2% NOI growth for our senior housing operating segment. While Assisted Living continues to outperform independent living driving exceptionally strong results in the U.S. and U.K., Canada is also joining the party with 17.2% NOI growth. We firmly believe that our Canadian portfolio is finally in sustainable growth mode. In fact, we're in process of significantly optimizing our Canadian business, and have recently allocated a meaningful amount of investment dollars to the region. I'll comment on both in a minute. It is also important to mention that our Seniors Apartment business continue to drive double-digit NOI growth despite the broader deceleration in the apartment industry. We have put significant effort in the last 6 years to build our Wellness Housing business which now nearly totals nearly 17,000 units, and we are pleased to see that our thesis is playing out. All in all, we have finally exceeded $1 billion of annualized net operating income in our Senior Housing segment for the first time since COVID and believe we have a ton of growth left in the tank. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I want to reiterate our core belief on how to make risk-adjusted return in Senior Housing. Unlike a lot of empirical years in the business, which either focuses on the location or the operators we believe it is a four-dimensional optimization problem of location, product, price point and operators. And we do this objectively through machine and statistical learning using our data science platform alpha. I'm delighted to inform you that we made perhaps the most significant impact in this pursuit through a mutually beneficial restructuring of our joint venture with Revera. Through a series of by sales, we materially simplified our balance sheet, and we matched specific products and locations with the right regional operators in order to achieve meaningful density in their local markets. In the U.K., we took 100% ownership of 29 premier communities, many of which are located in the Greater London market and consider some of the best care homes in the country. We transitioned this care homes from Signature to Avery and believe we have a material upside in this virtually impossible to replicate portfolio, which was 72.8% occupied at the time of transition to Avery at the beginning of June. Though two months does not make a trend, I am delighted to inform you that these communities are showing positive trends right off the bat under Lorna's leadership with current occupancy around 73.5%. In the U.S. We took 100% ownership of extremely well-located assets recently built by Sunrise in high barriers to entry submarket in the West Coast, East Coast and South Florida at a favorable basis and sold a minority interest in 12 other assets. We also moved management of 28 incredibly well-located California buildings to Oakmont, the California communities were 77% occupied when they are transitioned to Oakmont at the end of June. I fully expect this portfolio to be materially additive to our growth in 2024 under Courtney's leadership. As you can see in the case study on the Page 32 of our business update, highlighting previous Oakmont transitions in California. Courtney's team has taken occupancy from 64% to 90% in 2 years at these committees. Though this occupancy has far surpassed their previous high occupancy of 86% in 2016, I fully expect these communities will hit mid-90s occupancy in near future. All things being equal, that stabilization path should be faster for the most recent portfolio of 28 communities that they have assumed the management of. If not for the lessons learned previously, it will be for a higher starting point. And just after four weeks of operations under Oakmont, these properties are on a path to achieve approximately 100 basis points of occupancy growth in first month and are showing positive NOI traction in NOI out of the gate. And finally, Canada, perhaps the most exciting part of this yearlong effort to optimize our portfolio. Through though there is a multidimensional value creation opportunity in this effort I'm delighted to inform you that we are launching a new platform with our partner, Matthew Deguet in English-speaking Canada. As you know, Cogier, under Matthew's leadership is one of the best operators in the business, and we cannot be more excited about launching our first operating platform in a post PLR world. We will double down -- we'll double down on our investments in these communities, dramatically enhanced resident experience and materially improve employee experience, resulting in exciting long-term carrier growth opportunity. I predict this operating JV will witness rapid growth in very near future. The series of steps, which is known as Project Transformer inside Welltower is one of the most complex yet value-accretive transactions we have ever done. Under Eric Chung's leadership in Canada and U.K. and Ras Simon's leadership in the U.S., this multidimensional project will truly transform our company in the next chapter of its evolution. This transaction marks the conclusion of our 7-year journey of contract modernization as virtually all of our contracts are now in RIDEA 30 and RIDEA 40 structure. I cannot emphasize enough how important this milestone is for our farm as we have now full alignment with all of our key senior housing operating partners. We think or swim together. To continue this team of capital allocation, the favorable transaction environment that I described to you last quarter has resulted in an incredibly active summer for us. We currently have approximately $2.3 billion of deals under contract in 26 different off-market, privately negotiated transactions. Opportunities within Senior Housing segment represents the bulk of these transactions with approximately $2 billion of deals comprised of 8,900 units across all three regions. We estimate our investment in these deals to be very attractive, 30% to 40% discount of today's replacement cost, with accretive in-place cash flow and significant growth potential. While I don't like to get into individual transactions, I would like to highlight a transaction in Canada with our partner, Cogier. We're recapping Cogier's existing institutional investor at Propco in highly desirable SaaS portfolio, and Matthew is investing is equity going forward. This CAD 935 million transaction of both recently built and attractive stable assets are a testament to the power of our relationship in this industry. Eddie and his team has been working tirelessly over the past two years on this transaction, and we're delighted to inform you that we signed a definite documents three weeks ago. Additionally, following the completion of this deal and others under recently in a contract, we have achieved another company milestone having closed or signed over $11 billion of transactions since our pivot to offense in fourth quarter of 2020. But we are busier than ever with a robust feasible and actionable pipeline of opportunities that we're underwriting right now. Again, heavily senior housing, but we are also seeing some outpatient medical and skilled nursing opportunities up and down the capital stack. All of which we expect -- all of which we expect to keep us very busy for the rest of the year. Our deal teams didn't get much of summer vacation and looks like they won't get much of a Christmas holiday either as many of these deals will close in Q4. As I described last quarter, both debt and equity capital continue to rapidly evaporate from the commercial real estate space, we're getting hits left, right and center from counterparties who truly appreciate our handshake approach to the business where we can bring both cash and operator to the closing table. We're seeing that the banks are no longer willing to kick the can down the road and in fact, are showing willingness to sell their loan books partially or completely. A handful of these transactions have taken place and many more are brewing. The increased capital requirement directive from the regulators last week will only intensify this trend, and we are ready to help banks release their capital as they execute their other strategic priorities. Nikhil and Tim's cell phone number has been on full display in our full page ad of the American Banker Magazine since the summer of 2020. Please give them a call. I promise you they will respond within hours, not days as it is customarily acceptable standard in Senior Housing Industry. I predict Welltower will play a meaningful role in helping to recapitalize distressed commercial rest loan portfolios that fall within our circle of competence. And lastly, at the risk of stealing Tim's thunder, I would like to point out that our meaningful strengthening of our balance sheet over the last few quarters. Just in the last 1 year, our leverage has fallen from high 60s to mid-5s through a combination of outsized organic growth and prudent capital allocation activity. Were now armed with approximately $7.6 billion of near-term liquidity to address upcoming debt maturities and fund our various capital deployment opportunities. In summary, we have never been more delighted with our operating performance and have never been busier on the deal side and build-out of our platform. While no one knows what future may hold, my partners and I remain as optimistic as they were on the future of our business. And with that, I'll hand the call over to John. Thank you, Tim. We're currently living in an uncertain macroeconomic environment where the outlook is getting marked here by the day. One day it is sunny and the next day, all people see our dark clouds. The Federal Reserve appears to be resolute in its fight against inflation and seems far less inclined to come to rescue private and public markets as most participants like to hope for. Against this backdrop, we continue to take a very balanced approach as we consider both growth opportunities and risk environment. On one hand, we remain prudent and continue our deleveraging through rapid organic growth and appropriate capitalization of our external growth opportunities. On the other hand, we're aggressively putting capital to work, though where ever more price and return conscious. We cannot predict the macro, but we can predict with a high degree of confidence what is likely to come on a micro basis. And that is while we are seeing growth rolling over in most asset classes, including most other real estate property types, both the demand and supply outlook are getting better for us as we look into '24 and '25. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, I believe we're at the beginning of multiyear double-digit NOI growth cycle for our business, resulting from a long runway of occupancy gains rate growth and operating margin expansion. At Project Transformers, along with the relentless optimization of our operating platform, the impact which will start to show up in next year and the constraint reloading of our external growth and or perhaps the growth Bazooka at this point, through a highly targeted deals, you get an ideal setup for accelerating earnings and cash flow growth as we look into next year. With that, we'll open the call up for questions. Jonathan, we are not going to give away how we do these things today versus what we happened before. But I have mentioned in previous calls, that we have learned finally under John's leadership, how to do these transitions, right? But that's our proprietary obviously, you're seeing [indiscernible] that's showing up in the results, but we're not going to give away our secrets obviously on this call. Yes. Steven, we're not going to get into what other players might or might not be seeing. We can only tell you what we are seeing, we're seeing a very strong start of the spring selling -- summer selling season. If you think about how this business works, Obviously, the activities pick up very significantly, sales start to happen in sort of second quarter. That translated into third quarter, early fourth quarter occupancy gains. That's seasonally how the business works. And we have seen some significant traction this summer as we're moving into third quarter. We're seeing pricing trends getting better, occupancy trends getting better. So I really have no idea what you're referring to. But I can tell you that we're very pleased with second quarter occupancy, right? John just mentioned, our reported same-store numbers are impacted by the removal of the U.K. assets. But we're very, very pleased with what we have seen. We don't know what future holds. I'm not going to try to sit here and guess what the future will look like. But the promise we made to you and our owners is very simple. We will get more than what the market gives us, right? That's our execution. And we're very pleased with what we have seen so far. If you look at the demand supply, trends are getting better every day. It's not the other way around. The answer is the Sunrise contracts are not what you described. We restructured a contract with Sunrise in 2011 -- 2021, sorry 2021 and Sunrise is fully aligned with us with the principal philosophy that we're seeing ensuing together. So many years ago, I have described that our fundamental philosophy under my team's leadership has changed from owning part of management company's equity to contract. That's what we have described. And as you can see in one of the slides we have described a 7-year long effort to transform all our contracts from sort of top line focused contracts to bottom line focus contract where we think and swim together and virtually all of our contracts are there today. So that sort of hopefully gives you an answer to your question. We do not believe and we haven't done in sort of having influence on our communities through owning part of management contract part of management companies. We do it through our contracts, and that's where you can see in the evolution of those contracts. From an expansion standpoint, my comment that I made that this joint venture will have rapid growth. That comment obviously means that you will see that we're expanding where we're very excited about Canada and doing lots of expansions in Canada that will come. We're focused -- you think about it in a very simplistic terms, this platform that we're launching, we'll be focused on English-speaking Canada. Cogier has a tremendous brand in the French Canada and we'll watch this together from that. Now what we do in U.S. is a different conversation. Just understand that our PLR is on independent living and majority of our exposure in independent living is in Canada. That's why we're starting this. Let me see if I can answer your 5-part question. Likely, I will forget some pieces. So be -- frankly speaking, if we just take a step back and understand what's happening the stress that we see are not cash flow driven, the stress that we see are balance sheet driven. And the balance sheet driven comes in many forms. There's a significant lack of equity and debt capital today. In fact, when we say the debt market is functioning not functioning, most people assume that sort of the mid market remains, and it's not growing, it remains fairly flat. That's not what's happening today. The debt market -- Banks are under significant pressure from regulators to show up capital, which means they are actually selling they're shrinking, right? Then you add on top of that, a lot of the construction that happened between '15 and '19 time frame, they're on SOFR based loans, they're on LIBOR-based loans. And given how much that base rates have gone up, right, 500-plus basis points just in the last 12 months, is putting tremendous pressure. You think about it where a LIBOR plus 350, 400 it today, you are at 8%, 9% rate. And you just cannot -- these capital structures were not envisioned for that kind of rate environment. So you've got massive pressure on that. Then you see even people who put float caps, a lot of these floater caps are coming off second half of this year and next year. So and you add insert injury, majority of Senior Housing loans actually come with personal guarantees. So I can go on and on and on, but that's not the point. What you're asking is, is very simply, these assets are not stressed, the balance sheet behind assets are stressed. And we are ready and willing. And to do these executions, you just -- you need two things. You need cash because that we're not showing up with subject to financing, we're showing up with cash. And the other very important thing is operating partners. You need both to solve people's problems, their balance sheet problems and the go-forward problems, and that's why we're doing it. Now we're not going to get into on this call a multiyear sort of a earnings growth projection. As Tim has alluded to, DCR's earnings growth is significantly impacted by, obviously, our floating rate debt as well as strong dollar. You know what those numbers are. We have pointed out unless you believe rates are going from 5.5% to 11% again, you should not have those kind of impacts going forward, right? So from the NOI growth, with that, you can figure it out what that looks like. But from my comment, you can figure out that we're very excited about an accelerating earnings and cash flow growth trajectory as we look into '24. Yes. So I'll start with the last. Obviously, these assets have both occupancy and significant margin growth potential. With the occupancy, obviously, as you understand sort of the flow-through mechanics of this business. Majority of the profitability in the business is after, call it, 80% occupancy because there's very significant fixed costs. So incremental margin, if you will, after 80% occupancy is, call it, 70-plus margin. And then as you get closer to 90% or 90% -- about 90% occupancy we're at kind of 90 -- your incremental margins approach 90%, right? So majority of the profitable hockey stick profitability in that kind of 10% plus occupancy range. So that's what's the driver of the growth that we think baked into this. So we like buying low basis, lower occupancy portfolio. That's sort of what we do. We do not like to pay a cash flow on a highly occupied high NOI, which drives into obviously results into high-basis assets. We just don't do that here. That sort of gives you the answer to the second question, right? Let's just talk about the first question, which is a very simple question. You should assume a year 1 in this batch of acquisitions, roughly around 6%, going into 7 plus, following the math I just described to you. Yes. So we have never gotten into the time line of our bridge. This is part of our bridge, obviously. We'll leave you to determine when we think stable occupancy will come. And so that's part of your sort of answer to the first part of your question. The second part, I just want to point out one thing is what we are suggesting here is that $120 million we mentioned is part of the $414 million or so of the bridge. So that's what it is. If we thought that's all we're going to get, we would not have done it. In other words, the bridge, the fundamental tenet of the bridge is we go back to fourth quarter of '19 occupancy. If you look at Page 32, which sort of shows one of these transitions we have done, not only the first 6 that we gave it to Oakmont, exactly two years ago, today is actually exactly two years. These occupancies are above 90% where the prior peak was 86% and change in 2016. That gives you and I expect -- fully expect to believe they will be in mid-90s in the next few months. That gives you a sense of where we think the occupancy will go and what the margin will follow. For example, let me give you another example, the Canadian example. The Revera properties that we mentioned, I believe one of the pages said is like low sites occupancy. That portfolio is sitting at 23% margin, give or take today. I mentioned to you that Cogier runs in their Canadian portfolio of 40-plus person margin, that sort of gives you a sense of where we think that these properties can go. 120 is part of the bridge that shows you 414. But if we thought 120 is all we're going to get, we would not have done it. Yes. So one, we're not going to sit here and try to predict what will happen 6 months from now, but I expect a very strong rate environment in 2024 as well. What will that be exactly depends on a lot of things, but I have no reason to believe in a better environment of demand and supply, we're not going to have a strong pricing power. But we'll see when we get there. We have a lot of conviction on both continue to optimizing the labor side and other expenses. I would rather not get into what drivers you might get in the next 6 months versus 12 months, but I will point out that the utility side, the energy side, last fall was very, very significant hit.  So at least as we lap going into '24, we should get from a year-over-year perspective and frankly, energy prices have come down, we should see some benefit. But we're not going to sit here and just try to predict what might or not might play out on, but I will say that you have heard from our prepared remarks that we're feeling very good about continued margin expansion, not just sort of going back to pre-COVID, but we do think that John will take these margins much higher over a period of time. So first thing is, I'm going to elaborate again. I think I've done it before. I'm just going to tell you, we don't lend against assets that we don't want to own at the last dollar basis that we -- our loan sits at. So that's sort of the fundamental premise that we have. Having said that, different transactions come in different forms, were here to help people provide -- were here to help owners and borrowers with liquidity that they might need or institutions which owns already owns those loans. How different transaction will play out, whether it's an existing loan or we're coming in to provide capital, I don't know that yet. We are -- our focus investors and simple debt yield will determine where we get to, but just a coupon is less interesting for us. We'll start, obviously, probably we're thinking about how we can get equity returns. If we're just going in and 100 on the dollar when we are actually loaning into a situation that doesn't have debt. Or if it is existing debt, we're going to have to think about what type of discount gives us the right return, assuming we get our money back. And if we don't, we're comfortable owning the asset at that last dollar basis, philosophically, that's what we think about it. Every transaction is different. We'll have to get back to you on that. But generally speaking, you have assisted living fail further. So obviously, it has longer to come back. Independent living didn't fall that far, but it has been coming back slowly sort of slowly. But specifically, our portfolio has changed materially since '19 as far as Independent Living and Assisted Living is concerned. So we will have to those numbers and get back to you. But clearly speaking, I will tell you, the Assisted Living continue to outperform, we are seeing Independent Living is starting to come back. And frankly speaking, Independent Living for us, like 75%, 80% is Canada, and it's just sort of more of a -- I don't know it's a product comment or it's sort of it's a country comment, right? We're seeing very strong performance finally coming out of Canada, and we expect that will get better as all this sort of optimization that we're talking about around the [indiscernible] will play out but I cannot tell you, John, is it that if a product thing or just a country thing because majority of Independent portfolio sits in Canada."

            "name": "Tim McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2023 results. performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update, and finally, our updated full year 2023 outlook. Welltower reported second quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.20 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.90 per diluted share, representing 4% year-over-year growth or 16% growth after adjusting for HHS and the year-over-year impact from a stronger dollar and higher base rates on floating rate debt. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 12.7% year-over-year. Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter, in our Senior Housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 3.1% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.88x in the quarter. Next, Same-store NOI and long-term postcute portfolio grew 6.1% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.48x. Turning capital activity in the quarter. In May, we issued a $1.035 billion convertible note due in 2028. The note bears interest at 2.75% rate and is convertible at $95.41 per share. We intend to use the proceeds from the note to address our 2024 unsecured maturities coming due in the first quarter of next year. In addition to our convert offering, we continue to issue through our ATM to fund ongoing investment spend, raising gross proceeds of $1.76 billion since the beginning of the second quarter. This capital activity, along with continued growth across our business segments, including the solid post-COVID recovery within our Senior Housing Operating business helped drive net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 5.62x at quarter end, which represents well over a turn of deleveraging versus 1 year ago. As Shankh mentioned, we are seeing ample opportunity to invest our large cash balance. But even so, we expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA to remain below 6x on a pro forma basis post deployment and to continue to move lower as the senior housing operating portfolio continues to drive organic cash flow higher. Additionally, filing this intra and post-quarter capital activity, we have a current cash and cash equivalent balance $2.7 billion. Along with full capacity on our $4 billion revolving line of credit and $910 million of remaining expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan paydowns, representing approximately $7.6 billion in near-term gross available liquidity and $6.3 billion of liquidity when netting for the $1.35 billion of unsecured maturities we have in 2024. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance. Last night, we updated our previously issued full year 2023 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to a range of $0.73 to $0.84 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.48 to $3.59 per diluted share or $3.535 at the midpoint. Our updated normalized FFO guidance represents a $0.04 increase at the midpoint from our previously issued guidance. This increase in guidance is reflective of a $0.02 increase in expected full year senior housing operating NOI, a $0.02 increase from capital allocation activity, which assumes no further investments in the year beyond what has been announced to date and $0.01 from HHS and other out-of-period government grants received in 2Q. And these increases are offset by a $0.01 increase in expected full year G&A and interest expense. Underlying this FFO guidance is an increased estimate of total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 10% to 13%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute, 3% to 4%; senior housing triple net, 1% to 3%; and finally, increased Senior Housing Operating growth of 20% to 25% year-over-year. The midpoint of which is driven by continued better-than-expected expense trends, along with revenue growth of approximately 9.7%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 230 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth of approximately 6.7%. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. Yes, John, I think consistent with how we've been in the past, funding is going to be from the most attractive source you have, right? And whether that's public equity, debt or disposition proceeds, we'll continue to openly fund as we move along. So we would just hesitate to try to provide you forward guidance on that. It will be under made at whatever topmost time that we're funding."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Welltower First Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and please be advised that this call is being recorded. After the speakers' prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatt McQueen: Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the Company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review our first quarter results and describe high-level business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the performance of a senior housing operating and outpatient medical portfolio. Tim will walk you through triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and revised guidance. Nikhil is also on the call to answer questions. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with results that exceeded our expectations. Our strong performance was once again driven by outsized growth in our senior housing operating portfolio. We generated 23.4% same-store NOI growth, with both revenue and expense trends continue to move in the right direction. In fact, we produced our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth on the back of strong pricing power and occupancy build, with each coming slightly better than expected. But perhaps equally, if not more encouraging, is the margin expansion story, which has been driven by a significant improvement on the cost side. While we generated strong revenue growth in 2020, these gains were largely offset by pressure across the expense tax, which ultimately resulted a lost year in terms of partial growth. We are delighted by the progress made on various expense items, but particularly pleased by the sharp decline in agency labor or temporary staffing across the portfolio. Over the past few quarters, we have noted the headway our operating partners have made in net hiring, as JL employment rates have been weakening. This has ultimately translated into a meaningful reduction of prohibitively expensive temporary staffing, which -- with cost declining over 50% versus the first quarter of last year. Though we still have a long way to go to eradicate this problem which we largely attribute to committee leadership challenges, we believe that this trend along with strong pricing power will continue to be a tailwind for further margin expansion. From a product and geographic standpoint, while assisted living continued to outperform independent living, IL pricing is starting to strengthen. This is reflected in our Canadian portfolio, which is finally rebounding after a disappointing couple of years. We have seen standout performance from our operating partner Cogir, which has returned to almost 40% margin for the first time since COVID. We're grateful to our partner Mathieu Duguay and his team for their hard work and dedication. Sticking with that international team, our UK portfolio continues to produce strong revenue growth, and we're starting to see some green shoots on the cost side. During our call, I expressed my enthusiasm around the appointment of Lorna Rose as a CEO of a largest UK operator, Avery. Lorna is already making significant impact with a strong commercial acumen and impeccable leadership skills. We expect our UK portfolio to be a strong source of growth as we look at 2024 and beyond. Returning to the U.S., our largest operator Sunrise continues to produce strong top and bottom line results. There is meaningful embedded upside to this incredibly well located and virtually impossible to replicate portfolio which sits at mid-70s occupancy today. Also during our last call, I mentioned that we expect meaningful step function growth from a large regionally concentrated portfolio of StoryPoint. I'm pleased to report that Dan and his team has started the year off with a bang, as their no excuse culture and relentless focus on performance is paying off significantly. And last but not least, Oakmont. A year and a half ago we moved six well-located California properties to Oakmont and at that time, Courtney Siegel, Oakmont\u2019s CEO made me a promise that our team would lease up this portfolio in two years. I'm pleased to report that the portfolio today sits at 86% occupancy, while NOI has gone up 13 times since then. Courtney has set a simple performance-driven culture at Oakmont. If you're not 95% occupied, you're not performing. I'm confident that I will be able to soon report to you that this portfolio has reached 90 plus percent occupancy level. Pursuit of higher standard is prerequisite of high performance. Last year, I described to you that we as capital allocators strive to create partial value by compounding over a long period of time. By doing what's right in the long-term for our continuing shareholders may result in short-term pain. Our proactive portfolio management efforts, which includes transition of properties to strongest operators is an example of this philosophy. I encourage you to look at the case studies within our business update presentation for more details on Oakmont success and the other key operators including Peace Capital, which has created substantial value for our shareholders following the transition of a portfolio of skilled nursing facilities two years ago. By operating these facilities more efficiently from an expense perspective while increasing quality mix, Peace has been able to improve EBITDAR by more than 75% relative to the pre-COVID levels. This point is further underscored by our COVID class of acquisitions and our further efforts to transition other assets over the last few years. We're just beginning to capture significant embedded NOI from these properties as they return to their pre-COVID NOI levels and higher. And in fact, we have achieved 20% of that incremental NOI in the past quarter alone. Shifting to the operating platform and asset management initiatives. As you know -- as you have come to know, Welltower -- at Welltower, we vehemently reject mediocrity and are in relentless pursuit of high standards. We continue to behave -- believe that there's an opportunity to recognize meaningful cash flow from our own portfolio as we optimize location, product, price point, and operators using our data analytics platform Alpha. To further add to this multi-dimensional optimization problem using machine learning, our operating platform initiatives are now becoming more tangible, moving from drawing boards to pilots, while a few weeks don't make it trend, we are optimistic that John and his team are on the verge of some real creative breakthrough more on that incoming quarters. In terms of recent operating conditions, while I don't like to fix it on short term trends, I want to mention the consistent rise in demand for our seniors\u2019 product in Q1. Total volumes are up roughly 20% in the quarter, partially attributed to an easier comparison period last year due to Omicron variant, but also because of great organic demand as we enter another year of significant growth of the 80-plus population. Lease and tours have picked up further in April. While we remain confident in the prospect of business, I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the rising macroeconomic uncertainty as we approach the summer and fall leasing season. We're encouraged by what we are seeing so far, which admittedly is also the seasonally lowest -- slowest point in the year. Therefore, we need to see the -- what market gives us during the all important upcoming leasing season. The need-driven nature of our product gives me hope that we will outperform majority of the asset classes, not just real estate but it is also important for you to understand that we have no delusion of certainty. Moving to capital allocation, since our last call, U.S. banking sector has started to show some significant signs of strains, resulting in material declining trade flow in the economy. While no one is rooting for macroeconomic uncertainty, the current backdrop has certainly created a further expansion to our already attractive set of capital deployment opportunities. We remain disciplined and will not risk the enterprise that we built with blood, sweat and tears, but we remain optimistic that we'll be able to grow our portfolio with well located asset at highly favorable bases and in-place cash flow. To illustrate that point further, we acquired $529 million of asset during first quarter at a great basis and in-place cash flow. The K Street medical office building that we acquired in DC perhaps tells you how favorable the investment environment has become. We continue to see underwriting standards starting meaningfully, leverage levels decline, and banks are now requiring more commercial deposits and more recourse. As a low leveraged buyer, this backdrop is very beneficial for us. Our pipeline today is robust with opportunities to deploy capital across senior housing in all three countries, outpatient medical in the U.S. and data opportunities on the skilled side. Our team remains active and yet highly disciplined and price conscious as always. From a balance sheet standpoint, I wanted to quickly highlight the continued progress we made in terms of leverage and liquidity under Tim's leadership. He will get into more details. But I'm very pleased with significant deleveraging that we have achieved in past year with net debt to EBITDA falling almost a turn to 6.3 with further organic deleveraging going forward. And our ability to source over $1 billion of capital this year in the midst of a very challenging capital markets environment is a testament to the confidence entrusted in us by the banking community, the lenders, our investors and our other partners. With approximately $700 million of the cash on the books and undrawn line of credit, we are not only positioned to endure further capital market volatility, but also to deploy capital as opportunities arise. To summarize our optimism regarding the long-term growth trajectory of the business remains firmly intact. Top-line growth remains strong, expenses are moderating and our external growth opportunities continue to expand. While -- all the while John and his team are making progress in turning our vision of creating a world class operating platform into a reality. And with that, I will turn it over to him for an update on the operational element of the business and build out of the platform. John?\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh. Another great quarter, 11% same-store NOI growth of the prior year's quarter led by the senior housing operating portfolio with 23.4% year-over-year growth. These results speak for themselves. They're great. So, I'll provide limited color this quarter. Medical office portfolio's first quarter same store NOI growth was 1.6% over the prior year's quarter. As our guidance outlines, we expect the MOB portfolio to deliver between 2% and 3% same-store NOI growth in 2023. And therefore, we expect the remaining three quarters to be well above the first quarter number. Same-store occupancy was 94.9%, while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at 91.4%. The 23.4% first quarter NOI increase in our senior housing operating portfolio was a function of the 10% revenue growth and continued expense control for the period. I want to remind everyone that last quarter's revenue growth was driven in part by an operator pulling forward rental increases. Excluding that specific operator revenue growth in Q1 would have been 10.8%, 130 basis-point increase over the growth for Q4 2022 for the comparable portfolio. All three of our regions continued to show strong revenue growth, starting with Canada 7.7% and the U.S. and UK growing 9.3% and 17.4%, respectively. Revenue growth for the quarter was driven by a 240 basis-point increase in average occupancy and another quarter of healthy pricing power with RevPOR growth of 6.8%. The 10 basis-point increase in sequential occupancy during the first quarter period that has historically seen an occupancy decline due to seasonal factors reflects the continued increased demand for senior housing as we move into the all important spring and summer leasing season. Turning to expenses, agency use continues to decline, leading to a 53% expense decrease year-over-year for the same store portfolio in the first quarter of 2023. Welltower's continued aggressive asset management to keeping expenses in check, enabling margin expansion. During the first quarter, the operating margin expanded 240 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Regarding our operating platform, I'm very pleased with the progress the teams have made. We are executing rapidly as planned. As many of you know, I'm somewhat secretive about the details of our platform for proprietary reasons. However, I will say that one of the challenges our operators in the pilot are having is keeping up with the increased qualified leads, a very good problem to have. We're at the very beginning of this process but all lights are green at this time, and I'm very excited about the future. I'm grateful for the diversity of operational experience, engagement and enthusiasm of those operators who understand how the platform will transform the business, lead to consolidation and great success for the operators who leverage our best-in-class platform to improve the delivery of service to our customers, the quality of life of the employees and returns for our owners. I will now turn the call over to Tim.\nTim McHugh : Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2023 results, performance of our triple-net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet and liquidity update, and finally our updated full year 2023 outlook. Welltower reported first quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.05 per diluted share, and normalized funds from operations of $0.85 per diluted share, representing a 4% year-over-year growth and 13% growth after adjusting for the year-over-year impact from a stronger dollar and higher base rates on floating rate debt. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 11% year-over-year. Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 0.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage is 0.86 times in the quarter. Next same-store NOI on our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 4.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.33 times. Turning to capital market activity. In the quarter we raised $413 million through our ATM program, which helped fund accretive investment activity during the quarter and maintain debt to EBITDA at 6.31 times at quarter end, a substantial decrease from 7.1 times at 3/31/2022. In March, we swapped $350 million of our $1 billion 2027 floating rate term loan to a fixed rate of 5.335% through March of '24, bringing floating rate debt to 13.6% of total debt and just 4% of consolidated enterprise value as of quarter end. We ended the quarter with $639 million of cash, full capacity under $4 billion revolving line of credit and $393 million of expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan pay-downs, representing $5 billion in near-term available liquidity. Over the last 12 months, we've seen leverage meaningfully improve from its post COVID peak, reaching the first quarter of 2022. As our senior housing operating NOI has started to recover, we have experienced beginning stages of a cash flow growth driven deleveraging. And we have amplified this organic leverage reduction, the disciplined approach to capitalization of our external growth pipeline. The result of this approach is a balance sheet that in its current form is poised to be substantially lower levered than it was pre-COVID as we continue to see senior housing operating environment recover. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance. Last night we updated our previously issued full year 2023 outlook, the net income attributable to common stockholders to a range of $0.57 to $0.72 per diluted share, and normalized FFO of $3.39 to $3.54 per diluted share or $3.465 at the midpoint. Our updated normalized FFO guidance represents $0.025 increase at the midpoint from our previously issued guidance. This increase in guidance is reflective of $0.02 of fundamental outperformance, mainly from our senior housing operating segment, roughly $0.005 of which is from subsidies received in Q1 and a $0.005 from investment activity completed in Q1. Underlying this FFO guidance is an increased estimate of total portfolio year-over-year same store NOI growth of 9% to 13%, driven by sub-segment growth of outpatient medical 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute 3% to 4%, senior housing triple-net 1% to 3%, and finally increased senior housing operating growth of 17% to 24% year-over-year. The midpoint of which is driven by better than expected expense trends to start the year, along with year-over-year growth expectations of revenue, approximately 9.5%. Underlying this revenue growth is expectation of approximately 230 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth from approximately 6.3%. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. While we're very pleased with our quarterly results and our improved outlook, it's a bittersweet moment for us in Toledo as we mourn the passing of George Chapman. George was the former Chairman and CEO of Health Care REIT, Welltower\u2019s very sister company, and a gifted person and a visionary in the healthcare real estate space, and perhaps above all, an incredibly kind and generous individual. During his many years at Health Care REIT, George not only served as a leader of the company, but was also mentor and teacher to numerous individuals across the real estate space. He was raised in the Toledo area and always sought opportunities to give back to the community, including his high schools in Miami, and through his service on various boards to strengthen the northeast Ohio region. We are deeply appreciative of all he has done for us and he'll be missed dearly.  Lastly, before we go into Q&A, I wanted to highlight a document which we posted on our website last evening, which was also part of our shareholder letter published a couple of weeks ago. This document contents a set of ground rules or shared principles, which form Welltower's philosophical foundation for long-term compounding through capital allocation, risk mitigation, and culture amongst other factors, and ultimately the most importantly -- ultimately and most importantly, who we seek as our long-term investor partners as we execute our mission of delivering to them superior, absolute and relative total shareholder returns. I will now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question this morning from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: Hey, everybody. Good morning. Can you share your thoughts on further transitions and potential consolidation of operators within the portfolio? Because in your case studies, we were most impressed with Kisco. Are there opportunities to expand this relation from seven or eight communities, like you did with the Kensington? And look, we ask given all operators are not operationally equal. So, is there a plan or potential for further accretive transitions?\nShankh Mitra: So, Derek, you asked a lot of questions, so I'll try to -- I think I'll try to remember answer the question. Kisco is one of our best operating partners, and there are very significant opportunities to grow with Kisco. Whether that's through transition, that's through acquisition, that's through development, obviously, there's no question that they have absolutely hit it out of the park. So -- and we\u2019re having all these conversations going on. As I've mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, I believe that we finally have figured out hopefully how to do transition very creatively as you -- sort of your words, but I think that's a good one. I think, I've given some examples in my script and Oakmont. Let me give you another example. Probably last year, this time, we announced a large set of acquisitions with our partner, StoryPoint. And the first tranche of that acquisition closed in Q3. So, let's think about it. So, these properties -- the first tranche, there's 18 properties, the StoryPoint took over from a -- on the existing operator. At that point, that end of Q2, it had 74% occupancy, call it circa $6.5 million, $6.4 million of NOI, annualized NOI. And nine months later, they started taking this over in July, you would think that through transition, and all of those obviously moving this asset NOI -- that it will be great win, if occupancy and NOI held. Nine months later, today -- not today, end of March and the quarter end, occupancy was at 2%, NOI was $16.2 million. That tells you what a great operator with significant focus can do. So, it is my belief that now you got, obviously, John and his team and with our premium operating partners, who have done this many times over, during the most difficult time of COVID has figured out how to do this extremely well and creatively. I gave you a bunch of examples. We obviously provided more case studies. And we do think that there is significant opportunities to enhance our portfolio by what I said, optimizing four things, right? It's an optimization problem, which is location, product, price point, and operator, right? So, that's what you know, obviously Swagat and Kevin and their team are trying to constantly do, and we're executing that with our premium operating partners.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next now to Connor Siversky at Wells Fargo.\nConnor Siversky: Question on labor for me. I can appreciate that Welltower, the operator base has made a lot of headway on improving labor sourcing methods across the portfolio and then the positive trends related to agency usage. And so I'm curious, what does the training schedule look like for a new hire in a senior housing facility? And can you provide any color or number as to what turnover levels look like currently compared to say this time last year? And then what your expectations or goals are related to that turnover metric looking forward?\nJohn Burkart: Yes. I\u2019ll answer that. So, a couple of things there. One is, things are going fantastic. We've fundamentally changed how we looked at or how the operators look at that personnel and effectively created a hiring funnel to move people through that process. The training is dependent upon position, but can take from a few weeks to a couple of months in some jurisdictions, as far as certain requirements that are there. One of the things that I want to bring up, it\u2019s pretty important, it's a subtle piece, but it's pretty important. We appreciate the agencies stepping in when necessary to provide some assistance, but it's obviously both disruptive and not very efficient. So, as we move forward and we reduce agency and create a group of steady long-term employees, that substantially improves the quality of life for our residents, it improves our effectiveness and our efficiency. So, the benefits are not just reduce the expense, the benefits will come through via increased occupancy, increased RevPOR et cetera. As far as for the turnover, the turnover at this point in time is going down. We have numerous initiatives to improve the quality of life for our employees as well. As mentioned in the past, we are focused on that. We're looking through the lens of the employees. They are very hard working people, and making sure that they have what they need really for the whole aspect of their employment. Whether it\u2019d be things as simple as parking to break rooms to time off, et cetera, we've put a lot of effort into that. We continue to put effort into that. So that's a very positive area. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next now to Vikram Malhotra at Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: Shankh or Tim, I have a broad two-part question surrounding investments. Just maybe first, one of your peers had some challenges with the debt investment, they had to convert that. There are some headwinds there. If you could maybe give us some color on your loan book, and particularly, the investment you made with HC-One, I think a couple of years ago. Correct me, maybe it was over $700 million. I just want to understand the structuring, perhaps kind of the time you underwrote that, and just maybe even an update on the status? And just related to investments, Shankh you have very unique cost of capital -- relative cost of capital in a world where equity and debt is very, very hard to get, a lot of fear in the market. I'm just wondering, can you broadly give us color on where you are greedy in terms of capital structure or type of property? Thank you.\nShankh Mitra: Let me try to address both of those questions, and Nikhil will jump in if I miss anything. Okay? So let's just start with the second question first. We are always greedy when others are fearful, as you know. Where we're finding opportunities, as I mentioned, on my prepared remarks, that we see a substantial -- we have substantial actionable pipeline in seniors housing in all three countries. This is the first time we're seeing opportunities, not just in the U.S., but also in Canada and UK. So, we're very optimistic about senior housing opportunities in all three countries. And we are seeing substantial opportunities, albeit small deals. But as you know, Vikram, we're very focused on individual buying, individual assets, small transactions, outpatient medical in the U.S., right? So, that's sort of -- and we're seeing -- across capital structure, we're seeing opportunities on the debt side, in the skilled side of the business. So, that's sort of where we're seeing opportunities. First question, debt book. If you think about our debt book, you should think about our debt book in three different buckets. But before I get into it, I'll remind you that majority of these loans, right, just call it 80% of the book was originated after COVID. And we try to -- as we have discussed in many of these cases, so let's just talk about three buckets and you will understand. The first bucket is HC-One, you have specific question, I'll get to it. The second bucket is our partnership is related. And as I mentioned in previous call, these developments are structured as a participating means, right? That's the second bucket. Those are majority of the loans. If you take that -- go beyond that, the average size of the loan is like $12 million, right? So, we're focused on -- so let's just talk one at a time. We are very much focused on not just debt, but also last dollar basis of every bid, and possibly as a majority of these cases an equity feature that is attached to that debt. So let's talk about one at a time. We talked about the relative development pipeline, and that's obviously structured as a participating means. By definition that\u2019s equity like structure. Second, HC-One, if you go back and see what we said when we did that, that is a whole loan, that is a senior loan, unlike a lot of the things that you see. It is not a mezzanine loan. There is no senior in front of us. We are the senior. The last pound basis of that loan is $32,000 pounds per debt, which tells you how low levered that loan is. But to your question, if we were to take that over, which is we have no intention of, but if we were to take that over, there is no senior loan that sits in front of us, right? Understand our last dollar basis, what the values are in UK. That sort of gives you a sense of what it is. But more importantly, if you go back and see what I said when we did the loan, we have actually a substantial amount of equity behind that in terms of warrants, right? So -- and then you go to the last one, there are some pure debt, there's a lot of participating prep, participating mezz. So, that's sort of the convention of the loan book. So, we are -- we don't land anywhere where we don't think the last dollar is not significantly beneficial to us. We hope the people who borrow from us will do substantially well. And from the equity participating nature of many of these loans, we\u2019ll participate with them, not just get a return on and off our capital. Hopefully that's what's helpful for you.\nTim McHugh: I'll just quickly add on the two related projects that have delivered New York and San Francisco. New York senior housing opened in January of this year, and so four months in occupancy is beyond where we underwrote at the end of the first year. And San Francisco, which has been over -- open for about a year, is also ahead of underwriting\u2026\nShankh Mitra: And rates are substantial above\u2026\nTim McHugh: Exactly.\nOperator: We'll go next now to John Pawlowski at Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Shankh, you made the comment recently that if John and team are successful with their initiatives that the pace of improvement in expense growth will intensify from here. I'm just curious if some of the early operating initiatives you're currently working on were flowing through the cost structure of the business in recent quarters, how much lower would expense per occupied room growth been relative to like the 3.5% reported growth in recent quarters?\nShankh Mitra: So, I'm going to take that -- answer that question in two parts. First is asset management initiative and that asset management initiative that John has with his team, that you are seeing the impact on the agency labor and replacing that agency labor with permanent employees. And John mentioned many other sort of initiative that's going on to attract and retain talent, which would continue to reduce that number. The other side of that, your question is operating platform question. Here today, John is entirely focused on top line and we are seeing some signs of, as I mentioned on my prepared remarks, that we've just moved on few places from drawing board to pilots, and we're seeing some significant successes on leads and other situations that obviously we're not prepared to talk about it, that you're going to see on top line, not on the expenses yet. He will get to the expenses, but he's focused on the big ball today on the revenue side.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Michael Griffin at Citi.\nMichael Griffin: Maybe turning back to capital allocation, I'd just like to get some color maybe around the MOB acquisitions. It seems like it's pretty opportunistic. I believe, you all were selling MOBs back in summer of 2020, when people were buying. Maybe some color around -- you list the initial yields here. The occupancy at least for the K Street one seemed kind low. Maybe Nikhil, in your underwriting, are you assuming maybe a stabilized high-80s, low-90s occupancy? And then, Shankh, as a capital allocator, if we go back to your third quarter prepared remarks about those -- those five sources of capital. Does any one of those, whether it's debt or equity, selling assets, does any one screen as more attractive right now?\nShankh Mitra: Okay. Nikhil will walk you through the MOB acquisitions that we did in the quarter. But let me just answer some of the other questions you asked. So, as you think about it, the five sources of capital, we have accessed three of them this quarter. We have done public equity, we have done private equity. We have sold assets and took capital, and very attractive, obviously return. So you can see it, as an example, on slide 12, the case studies that we put together on some of those assets and how we significantly maximize value there. We still have some participation left in that transaction. And the other thing was debt but that was on the secured side. So as you think about menu of capital, don't just think this is public equity and public debt, right, which is obviously the good -- very good source of capital and has been for us, but also think about private source of capital, whether it's joint venture, asset sales and private source of debt. Senior housing is a housing business and we have substantial portfolio under leveraged portfolio in U.S. and in Canada, which has very significant agency support, right? So, this quarter, in U.S., we have executed one transaction. But as you think about capital, think about menu of options, and depending on -- what that manual auction, how it is priced on a given day, we execute and think -- and only think through that use of capital as it relates to what are the returns of that as we deploy the capital back on an unlevered IRR basis, and from the perspective of the long term return. That's just how we invest capital. Nikhil?\nNikhil Chaudhri: Yes. I think to answer your question on the MOB, if you look at the K Street, that's roughly 20% of the capital we deployed to large medical office this quarter. K Street -- and we're buying it at less than half of replacement cost with a 6.6% in-place yield at low-80s occupancy. And we've underwritten this to be beyond an 8% stabilized yield with occupancy with a 9 in front of it. I mean just think about the quality of the real estate, right? I mean, it's 3 blocks from the metro station; it's 2 blocks from the George Washington University Hospital. You've got top grade parking. I mean, it has high quality of an asset that you can get, and we're getting it with very healthy in-place yield with a lot of upside. The other two portfolios, they are core as they get. They've got healthy lease terms, high occupancy, above 95%, and very good affiliation with great health systems.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next now to Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Tim, I would -- you mentioned there's more delevering ahead. Just curious if you could kind of expand on those comments and how we should think about the trajectory of that deleveraging?\nTim McHugh: So, we -- as we've talked about in the past, there's kind of two prongs to which we get the balance sheet back to the range, pre-COVID range, target range of 5.5 times to 6 times leverage. And the main one is just seeing NOI recover back to pre-COVID levels. We've been pretty clear in that, that that shouldn't be taken as a stated goal of where NOI and those assets sit, just more so a marker on the ground of where NOI actually was in those assets. And then what the impact, both on earnings and leverage would be just to get it back to that level. And then obviously, we plan to get well beyond that. So think about our current leverage profile. Part of our deleveraging from 7.1% last year has been driven by the kind of beginning stages of that NOI recovery. And then, as we've capitalized our external growth pipeline, we've continued to be pretty disciplined about the way that we've capitalized at the equity. And so, we've driven down current leverage much faster than what -- if it had just been purely through organic cash flow recovery. So now sitting at 6.3 times leverage this quarter, if you were to layer on kind of just a recovery of NOI back to pre-COVID levels, you get down to around 5 times flat. So that's kind of the comment on seeing expectation that if you just take our current capital structure, we knew nothing and you continue to see NOI recover back to pre-COVID levels, you'll see us get to a leverage level that's well below where we would have been or where we were pre-COVID.\nOperator: We go next now to Steve Sakwa at Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Shankh, I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about the pricing power trends that you're seeing in senior housing and maybe some of the feedback you're getting from the operators vis-\u00e0-vis kind of the residents and how you see that pricing may be trending into the second half of the year. And does that continue in the \u201824.\nShankh Mitra: John, do you want to take that?\nJohn Burkart: Yes, glad to take that. What we're seeing is tremendous strength in the -- across the board. The feedback from the operators is very positive. What's going on is people are appreciating that the environment that they have, they're appreciating the social environment and the demand is strong. And it's quite affordable. Obviously, it's an asset play for the assisted and memory care living. And so the expectation is as to how this plays out. We have nothing that we're seeing would indicate that it's not going to continue with great strength for the foreseeable future. It's a supply-demand situation at one point. And obviously, demand is substantial and supply is very, very, very limited going forward.\nShankh Mitra: I'll just add one point of color perhaps. First thing is, Steve, as I mentioned, as you think about pricing power, the initial phase of pricing power has been that our cost has been going up. And obviously, to bring back these communities to a profitable level or the only which -- only way this will actually continue to serve the community if they're profitable, right, over a long period of time is to increase pricing. And as I mentioned in last call that you will see the next 12, 18 months handover from pricing because cost has gone up to pricing power because we have no room to sell, right? And that handover will come. And so the second point is just understand that we're not focused on absolute level of pricing but we are focused on the difference, the delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR. That's what drives P&L, right? So keep those two in mind, and you will see where our focus has been and continue to -- will be. As we think as just understand our portfolio, it\u2019s roughly speaking, half and half on an average basis and an average year is January versus throughout the year, right? And so we continue to -- as we roll these leases and market rate continues go up, we expect that pricing will continue to remain strong.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: Current development pipeline, it looks like it's about 15% outpatient medical office and the balance in senior housing. I guess, as you think about anticipated starts over the next few years, do you see that mix shifting dramatically between those buckets?\nShankh Mitra: Actually, if you look at into the senior housing bucket, you will see that majority of the new capital outlay has been on the wellness side of the house rather than on the senior housing side of the house. So -- and I expect that will absolutely continue. Medical office majority, obviously all of our medical office -- I shouldn't say majority. All of our medical office developments have been 100% pre-leased yield on cost development. So we're not exposed to the cost risk. Some hits in different quarters, so you saw a bunch of them hit this quarter, which we have been working on for many, many years, but we should not expect anything different going forward. And majority of that what is showing up at senior housing development are actually on the wellness side of the house.  Senior housing development as seniors product is very, very hard to make numbers work today. So we're not that focused on that side of the house unless it is a very special project in a very special location, such as some of the related projects that Nikhil talked about.\nOperator: We go next now to Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. \nMichael Carroll: So if the seniors housing operator wants to access Welltower's platform, what do they have to do? I mean, do they need to sign some type of exclusive agreement, or will you help any operator that manages your specific assets? And just one last thought. Are these -- are there different levels of services that you provide operators? So, if you have an exclusive agreement, they can kind of fully tap your platform and if they just manage an asset, then you kind of are offering them help, but maybe not allowing them fully accessing your data?\nShankh Mitra: So, we're not going to get on this call about contractual agreements and what kind of different levels of service and situations that might be going. We'll just focus on the fact that we have aligned interest with our operators. As always said, for years and years that the RIDEA 3 or the structures are all about thinking and swimming together, right? And there is substantial upside to many of these portfolios for us, but also for our operating partners. So this is -- we have different types of arrangements with different people. We're not going to obviously get into on this call. But understand, at the end of the day, the goals are very simple. We're trying to create a very good environment for our residents. We're trying to create an environment for our employees to stay and -- turnover, resident satisfaction, employee satisfaction and frankly, owner satisfaction. That's the goal. And if we can match those goals, it will be great for us and it will be great for our operating partners\nOperator: We go next now to Austin Wurschmidt at KeyBank. \nAustin Wurschmidt: Shankh, you highlighted a robust investment pipeline with opportunities across all your regions. I know you're return-driven as you consistently highlight. But given the pricing power you're seeing in IL in Canada or the acceleration in growth you highlighted in the UK, heading into 2024, are returns more attractive in those regions today? And are you considering kind of leaning in, I guess, more international versus domestically in the senior housing side?\nShankh Mitra: I wish the answer to your question was yes, but the answer is no. Canada is a very tight market with very significant -- a few handful of owners, handful of banks and very significant CMAC presence. So returns in Canada usually are pretty tight. We're seeing opportunities to create value through our great operating partner that's there. UK, we're actually now starting to see very significant returns. We made one investment in UK this quarter, like last quarter. And we are seeing that. So UK returns are good, actually very good. But I will tell you the vast majority of opportunities are in the U.S. And frankly speaking, there -- because it's such a deep and robust pipeline that you can pick your spots and make some significant returns as -- we're seeing the unlevered IRRs in the senior space today without getting into which country -- what return for which country, but roughly speaking, I'll say, close to double digits. We're seeing opportunities that are in the double digits. Medical office today, IRR opportunities are 8.5% plus, I would say. And obviously, we are very focused on sort of participating debt structures in the SNF side where we can create high-teen returns despite using some debt and some equity like features that I talked about in probably in the high-teens. So that's kind of our focus. We're purely return driven. We're purely basis driven. And all we are trying to do is we're trying to figure out where can we add value, not through just financial capital, but those four things I talked about. It's an optimization problem, right? It's an optimization problem of location, product, price point and operator. That's how you make money in this business. And that's how we're trying to create value.\nOperator: We go next now to Steven Valiquette at Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: So, just to follow up on your earlier comments on the senior housing pricing power for the rest of '23 and into '24, I think you kind of suggested for us to maybe not focus as much on the absolute price increases at this stage, but just more on the spread between RevPOR versus ExpPOR. I guess really the question is, without giving any specific guidance, can you just give us maybe just a general sense or range of what you might be targeting for the spread between RevPOR versus ExpPOR over the next few years? Is 200 to 300 basis points a reasonable assumption, the trend you've seen over the past several quarters, or should we think more conservatively at this stage when thinking beyond '23?\nShankh Mitra: So I was trying to add value -- added color to the question that previously was asked. Tim already gave you our view of RevPOR increase as we sit today, right, 6.3% increase that we talked about. So, I was trying to provide more color as we think about long term. Long term, we're focused on the spread between RevPOR and ExpPOR. By no means, I'm trying to say that we're seeing anything in that sort of -- around us that says that pricing power is cooling down. In fact, it's powerful. And I think John probably mentioned that. All I was trying to point out that long term without thinking about is it 6%, is it 12%, is it 3%? The way you're going to get the P&L right, which is ultimately what we are focused on, is the spread between that RevPOR and ExpPOR, right? So, that's what I was trying to answer. We do think that we'll see significant pricing power continue, as I mentioned, half of our portfolio gets renewed at different points in the anniversary cycle and street trade continues to go up. Hope that's helpful.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Nick Yulico at Deutsche Bank.\nNick Yulico: Just turning to the guidance, I want to make sure I'm understanding this right. So in terms of the NAREIT FFO guidance range coming down, there's various normalized items, expenses that are being added back to normalized FFO. A lot of that\u2019s transaction costs, promotes. I know you guys break this out. But just trying to understand what's driving that. It's a pretty regular line item going back for the last year? And how we should think about -- is this still going to be other transaction costs hitting the P&L for the rest of the year, but it's just not in your NAREIT FFO guidance right now? Thanks.\nTim McHugh: Yes. Thanks, Nick. So, the transaction costs you're referencing, so other expenses, which is predominantly transaction costs, think about that being, as I described in the footnote, non-capitalizable transaction costs, a lot of that tends to be dead deal cost. So, tough to predict kind of how that comes through. We're a pretty active firm. I'd say that's stepped up a bit this quarter just because of -- as we've talked about and as Shankh has highlighted on a few prior calls. Our underwriting standards have picked up a bit, and we've seen cost increase. So, you think about some developments that we've gotten beyond kind of early stage development spend and we think in a fairly disciplined manner walked away from. So if we kind of look forward, similar to the way we don't try to guide to acquisition cost, we try to have flexible framework is how we think about acquisition volume. Flexible framework is how we think about investing dollars. And the same goes for -- as we pursue things with the intent to move forward, if we end up not moving forward with them, they could not coming to this line item. But it's not something that we kind of have -- we've made decisions on right now or else it would be coming through this quarter.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Ronald Kamdem at Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just the presentation has sort of highlighted that the outsized occupancy gain was in AL and in other parts of the business. Just a little bit more color on sort of the IL versus AL difference would be helpful because some of the NIC data suggests IL is accelerating. I think you mentioned that as well, would be helpful. And then the follow-up was, post the PLR ruling, just what are the updated thoughts and vision in terms of having an in-house sort of operating platform? And any color on timing, cost would be helpful.\nShankh Mitra: Let me try to take the first one, and John, why don't you take the second one? As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, assisted living continued to significantly outperform independent living. The only thing I was trying to highlight that after underperformance, independent living is starting to pick up, particularly in Canada. And that's what we are seeing starting to come through our Canadian numbers, right? But if you just look at an absolute performance between the two, there is no question that assisted living has been outperforming. And if economy continues to weaken, on a given rolling 12 to 18-month period, my guess is that it will continue to outperform very significantly, given the need-driven nature of the business.\nJohn Burkart: Yes. Regarding the self-management of PLR, I want everyone to keep in mind, our focus is and always has been on driving results. That is the number one most important thing to whether we're managing directly, whether we're asset managing and our partners are managing is less the point and it's more about getting the results. So with that said, I think it's probable that we end up in some form of self-management this year. And I would say as far as the costs go, what's happening right now is we're working very quickly on the technology aspect and data analytics aspect of the operating platform. And that really is just swapping out. So, our operators have modules. They're paying for those modules, and now we're switching them to our module. So, that is close to a net zero on the cost side. There are a few other costs as we improve things, which will provide some more clarity going forward. But none of these are really big numbers. So, I wouldn't worry about that in the sense of very big surprises. It's just really changing out and getting improved modules going forward. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nOperator: We go next now to Michael Griffin at Citi.\nMichael Griffin: Great. I appreciate the follow-up. Just a quick one. I noticed in your investor presentation, I think it's slide 7, last quarter, it said the comp for growth decelerated at 2.6. I know it\u2019s kind of nitpicky and I didn\u2019t see anything on the slide in the current deck. So, I don\u2019t know maybe McHugh or someone, if you just clarify if there's that number available. That would be helpful.\nTim McHugh: Yes, Michael. So, the -- what we've provided is the pool change. I think one thing you're noting is that we've seen kind of export pick up from fourth quarter to the first quarter. And we gave the number on what first quarter would have been based on the fourth quarter pool, as you noted in the footnote. And then just on the pickup in general, the reported same-store number in 4Q, 1Q, it's actually because we continue to expand the same-store pool. So, you've got 95% of our operational properties that we've owned for more than four quarters in our same-store pool now and a lot of the transitions that came in were from the UK. And U.K., we've just seen expense growth run higher than the rest of the portfolio, largely driven by utilities, which we've talked about a lot on this call. So, some of the increase you're seeing just in 1Q is from that mix shift and inclusion of more UK properties.\nShankh Mitra: Also, UK is at the sort of the earlier stages of normalizing labor cost. So, it's the addition of UK that it makes it look like the comp has gone up. But if you look at on a same-store basis of -- not a same-store basis, but the same pool of fourth quarter, you will see it was relatively the same.\nOperator: We go next now to Juan Sanabria at BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just a big picture question. Curious if you guys could comment on overall seniors housing penetration. Talking to some of the privates and just reading some of the trade racks, it seems like acuity levels have gone up and maybe seniors are waiting to come in. Just, I guess, are you seeing that? What does that mean for the business? And what are your thoughts about overall penetration rates and the ability to effectuate that through marketing or what have you as part of this new data-driven platform and efforts?\nShankh Mitra: So, I'll try to address first part of your question. So, acuity actually went off I would say, in 2020, right? If you didn't absolutely need it, you would avoid the product pre-vaccine. So we obviously have seen acuity gone up in 2020, but since then, we have seen acuity sort of normalize. So, I'm not sure that I subscribe to this idea that acuity across the board for the industry has been going up. In fact, someone just asked earlier in the question pool about Kisco. I was with the Kisco team last week and Kisco\u2019s CEO was talking to me that acuity -- they have seen acuity actually gone down, right? So probably gone down for some, gone up for some, but I do believe that acuity has normalized from that 2020 peak levels as we have seen vaccine come into play. You want to answer the second?\nJohn Burkart: Yes, I'll just add a little bit. So obviously, as I said, the supply-demand incredibly favorable. We've said it many times. Then you get to the next piece, which is penetration, which you're talking about. And I actually see penetration increasing. And what we're seeing is the senior desire, the loneliness of the desire for social -- safe active location as well as the cost of care. The cost of care has continually gone up. We all know that. The labor for care has been a challenge, and where you see that the most is in home care. And so we've had people move into our properties because they can't afford or cannot get the level of care. And so, their costs actually net go down, which is a benefit. So I see that playing itself out over the next couple of years, so we get the benefit of supply-demand. Additionally, we get the benefit of penetration. And then finally, the platform will drive greater market share, and we'll get that benefit as well. So I see a very, very favorable future going forward.\nOperator: We'll take our final question this morning from Vikram Malhotra at Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: Just two clarifications. Tim, I guess, in your last call you had mentioned in the guide, you were keeping the temp usage as a percent of total intact or flat through the year in your guide. And with what you've seen in 1Q, are you changing that in terms of it being lower? And then second, in the medical office side, I think the OpEx went up maybe 7% or 8%. I'm just wondering, is there anything onetime in that number?\nTim McHugh: Yes. So, I'll start with your first question on senior housing and John can add any color on the MOB side. So for senior housing, yes, you're correct. We came in -- our first quarter results were better than expected as far as how agency came down. And of course, some of that benefit gets netted out with full-time employees coming on, but net-net, we ended up in a more favorable spot for compensation. And as I kind of noted in my guidance outlook, that's largely what's moving our outlook for the year is just a better trend coming out of Q1 on expenses with that being the main piece and the assumption revenue kind of holds given that we're moving into the revenue building months as we speak.\nJohn Burkart: And then on the MOB, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting guidance is between 2% and 3%. And so that is a timing issue for Q1, and it will reverse as we go through Q2, Q3 and Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that will bring us to the conclusion of the Welltower first quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. We'd like to thank you all so much for joining us this morning and wish you all a great remainder of your day. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nikhil Chaudhri",
            "content": "Yes. I think to answer your question on the MOB, if you look at the K Street, that's roughly 20% of the capital we deployed to large medical office this quarter. K Street -- and we're buying it at less than half of replacement cost with a 6.6% in-place yield at low-80s occupancy. And we've underwritten this to be beyond an 8% stabilized yield with occupancy with a 9 in front of it. I mean just think about the quality of the real estate, right? I mean, it's 3 blocks from the metro station; it's 2 blocks from the George Washington University Hospital. You've got top grade parking. I mean, it has high quality of an asset that you can get, and we're getting it with very healthy in-place yield with a lot of upside. The other two portfolios, they are core as they get. They've got healthy lease terms, high occupancy, above 95%, and very good affiliation with great health systems."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Shankh. Another great quarter, 11% same-store NOI growth of the prior year's quarter led by the senior housing operating portfolio with 23.4% year-over-year growth. These results speak for themselves. They're great. So, I'll provide limited color this quarter. Medical office portfolio's first quarter same store NOI growth was 1.6% over the prior year's quarter. As our guidance outlines, we expect the MOB portfolio to deliver between 2% and 3% same-store NOI growth in 2023. And therefore, we expect the remaining three quarters to be well above the first quarter number. Same-store occupancy was 94.9%, while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at 91.4%. The 23.4% first quarter NOI increase in our senior housing operating portfolio was a function of the 10% revenue growth and continued expense control for the period. I want to remind everyone that last quarter's revenue growth was driven in part by an operator pulling forward rental increases. Excluding that specific operator revenue growth in Q1 would have been 10.8%, 130 basis-point increase over the growth for Q4 2022 for the comparable portfolio. All three of our regions continued to show strong revenue growth, starting with Canada 7.7% and the U.S. and UK growing 9.3% and 17.4%, respectively. Revenue growth for the quarter was driven by a 240 basis-point increase in average occupancy and another quarter of healthy pricing power with RevPOR growth of 6.8%. The 10 basis-point increase in sequential occupancy during the first quarter period that has historically seen an occupancy decline due to seasonal factors reflects the continued increased demand for senior housing as we move into the all important spring and summer leasing season. Turning to expenses, agency use continues to decline, leading to a 53% expense decrease year-over-year for the same store portfolio in the first quarter of 2023. Welltower's continued aggressive asset management to keeping expenses in check, enabling margin expansion. During the first quarter, the operating margin expanded 240 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Regarding our operating platform, I'm very pleased with the progress the teams have made. We are executing rapidly as planned. As many of you know, I'm somewhat secretive about the details of our platform for proprietary reasons. However, I will say that one of the challenges our operators in the pilot are having is keeping up with the increased qualified leads, a very good problem to have. We're at the very beginning of this process but all lights are green at this time, and I'm very excited about the future. I'm grateful for the diversity of operational experience, engagement and enthusiasm of those operators who understand how the platform will transform the business, lead to consolidation and great success for the operators who leverage our best-in-class platform to improve the delivery of service to our customers, the quality of life of the employees and returns for our owners. I will now turn the call over to Tim. Yes. I'll answer that. So, a couple of things there. One is, things are going fantastic. We've fundamentally changed how we looked at or how the operators look at that personnel and effectively created a hiring funnel to move people through that process. The training is dependent upon position, but can take from a few weeks to a couple of months in some jurisdictions, as far as certain requirements that are there. One of the things that I want to bring up, it's pretty important, it's a subtle piece, but it's pretty important. We appreciate the agencies stepping in when necessary to provide some assistance, but it's obviously both disruptive and not very efficient. So, as we move forward and we reduce agency and create a group of steady long-term employees, that substantially improves the quality of life for our residents, it improves our effectiveness and our efficiency. So, the benefits are not just reduce the expense, the benefits will come through via increased occupancy, increased RevPOR et cetera. As far as for the turnover, the turnover at this point in time is going down. We have numerous initiatives to improve the quality of life for our employees as well. As mentioned in the past, we are focused on that. We're looking through the lens of the employees. They are very hard working people, and making sure that they have what they need really for the whole aspect of their employment. Whether it'd be things as simple as parking to break rooms to time off, et cetera, we've put a lot of effort into that. We continue to put effort into that. So that's a very positive area. Thank you for the question. Yes, glad to take that. What we're seeing is tremendous strength in the -- across the board. The feedback from the operators is very positive. What's going on is people are appreciating that the environment that they have, they're appreciating the social environment and the demand is strong. And it's quite affordable. Obviously, it's an asset play for the assisted and memory care living. And so the expectation is as to how this plays out. We have nothing that we're seeing would indicate that it's not going to continue with great strength for the foreseeable future. It's a supply-demand situation at one point. And obviously, demand is substantial and supply is very, very, very limited going forward. Yes. Regarding the self-management of PLR, I want everyone to keep in mind, our focus is and always has been on driving results. That is the number one most important thing to whether we're managing directly, whether we're asset managing and our partners are managing is less the point and it's more about getting the results. So with that said, I think it's probable that we end up in some form of self-management this year. And I would say as far as the costs go, what's happening right now is we're working very quickly on the technology aspect and data analytics aspect of the operating platform. And that really is just swapping out. So, our operators have modules. They're paying for those modules, and now we're switching them to our module. So, that is close to a net zero on the cost side. There are a few other costs as we improve things, which will provide some more clarity going forward. But none of these are really big numbers. So, I wouldn't worry about that in the sense of very big surprises. It's just really changing out and getting improved modules going forward. Hopefully, that's helpful. Yes, I'll just add a little bit. So obviously, as I said, the supply-demand incredibly favorable. We've said it many times. Then you get to the next piece, which is penetration, which you're talking about. And I actually see penetration increasing. And what we're seeing is the senior desire, the loneliness of the desire for social -- safe active location as well as the cost of care. The cost of care has continually gone up. We all know that.

And so, their costs actually net go down, which is a benefit. So I see that playing itself out over the next couple of years, so we get the benefit of supply-demand. Additionally, we get the benefit of penetration. And then finally, the platform will drive greater market share, and we'll get that benefit as well. So I see a very, very favorable future going forward. And then on the MOB, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting guidance is between 2% and 3%. And so that is a timing issue for Q1, and it will reverse as we go through Q2, Q3 and Q4."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review our first quarter results and describe high-level business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the performance of a senior housing operating and outpatient medical portfolio. Tim will walk you through triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and revised guidance. Nikhil is also on the call to answer questions. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with results that exceeded our expectations. Our strong performance was once again driven by outsized growth in our senior housing operating portfolio. We generated 23.4% same-store NOI growth, with both revenue and expense trends continue to move in the right direction. In fact, we produced our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth on the back of strong pricing power and occupancy build, with each coming slightly better than expected. But perhaps equally, if not more encouraging, is the margin expansion story, which has been driven by a significant improvement on the cost side. While we generated strong revenue growth in 2020, these gains were largely offset by pressure across the expense tax, which ultimately resulted a lost year in terms of partial growth. We are delighted by the progress made on various expense items, but particularly pleased by the sharp decline in agency labor or temporary staffing across the portfolio. Over the past few quarters, we have noted the headway our operating partners have made in net hiring, as JL employment rates have been weakening. This has ultimately translated into a meaningful reduction of prohibitively expensive temporary staffing, which -- with cost declining over 50% versus the first quarter of last year. Though we still have a long way to go to eradicate this problem which we largely attribute to committee leadership challenges, we believe that this trend along with strong pricing power will continue to be a tailwind for further margin expansion. From a product and geographic standpoint, while assisted living continued to outperform independent living, IL pricing is starting to strengthen. This is reflected in our Canadian portfolio, which is finally rebounding after a disappointing couple of years. We have seen standout performance from our operating partner Cogir, which has returned to almost 40% margin for the first time since COVID. We're grateful to our partner Mathieu Duguay and his team for their hard work and dedication. Sticking with that international team, our UK portfolio continues to produce strong revenue growth, and we're starting to see some green shoots on the cost side. During our call, I expressed my enthusiasm around the appointment of Lorna Rose as a CEO of a largest UK operator, Avery. Lorna is already making significant impact with a strong commercial acumen and impeccable leadership skills. We expect our UK portfolio to be a strong source of growth as we look at 2024 and beyond. Returning to the U.S., our largest operator Sunrise continues to produce strong top and bottom line results. There is meaningful embedded upside to this incredibly well located and virtually impossible to replicate portfolio which sits at mid-70s occupancy today. Also during our last call, I mentioned that we expect meaningful step function growth from a large regionally concentrated portfolio of StoryPoint. I'm pleased to report that Dan and his team has started the year off with a bang, as their no excuse culture and relentless focus on performance is paying off significantly. And last but not least, Oakmont. A year and a half ago we moved six well-located California properties to Oakmont and at that time, Courtney Siegel, Oakmont's CEO made me a promise that our team would lease up this portfolio in two years. I'm pleased to report that the portfolio today sits at 86% occupancy, while NOI has gone up 13 times since then. Courtney has set a simple performance-driven culture at Oakmont. If you're not 95% occupied, you're not performing. I'm confident that I will be able to soon report to you that this portfolio has reached 90 plus percent occupancy level. Pursuit of higher standard is prerequisite of high performance. Last year, I described to you that we as capital allocators strive to create partial value by compounding over a long period of time. By doing what's right in the long-term for our continuing shareholders may result in short-term pain. Our proactive portfolio management efforts, which includes transition of properties to strongest operators is an example of this philosophy. I encourage you to look at the case studies within our business update presentation for more details on Oakmont success and the other key operators including Peace Capital, which has created substantial value for our shareholders following the transition of a portfolio of skilled nursing facilities two years ago. By operating these facilities more efficiently from an expense perspective while increasing quality mix, Peace has been able to improve EBITDAR by more than 75% relative to the pre-COVID levels. This point is further underscored by our COVID class of acquisitions and our further efforts to transition other assets over the last few years. We're just beginning to capture significant embedded NOI from these properties as they return to their pre-COVID NOI levels and higher. And in fact, we have achieved 20% of that incremental NOI in the past quarter alone. Shifting to the operating platform and asset management initiatives. As you know -- as you have come to know, Welltower -- at Welltower, we vehemently reject mediocrity and are in relentless pursuit of high standards. We continue to behave -- believe that there's an opportunity to recognize meaningful cash flow from our own portfolio as we optimize location, product, price point, and operators using our data analytics platform Alpha. To further add to this multi-dimensional optimization problem using machine learning, our operating platform initiatives are now becoming more tangible, moving from drawing boards to pilots, while a few weeks don't make it trend, we are optimistic that John and his team are on the verge of some real creative breakthrough more on that incoming quarters. In terms of recent operating conditions, while I don't like to fix it on short term trends, I want to mention the consistent rise in demand for our seniors' product in Q1. Total volumes are up roughly 20% in the quarter, partially attributed to an easier comparison period last year due to Omicron variant, but also because of great organic demand as we enter another year of significant growth of the 80-plus population. Lease and tours have picked up further in April. While we remain confident in the prospect of business, I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the rising macroeconomic uncertainty as we approach the summer and fall leasing season. We're encouraged by what we are seeing so far, which admittedly is also the seasonally lowest -- slowest point in the year. Therefore, we need to see the -- what market gives us during the all important upcoming leasing season. The need-driven nature of our product gives me hope that we will outperform majority of the asset classes, not just real estate but it is also important for you to understand that we have no delusion of certainty. Moving to capital allocation, since our last call, U.S. banking sector has started to show some significant signs of strains, resulting in material declining trade flow in the economy. While no one is rooting for macroeconomic uncertainty, the current backdrop has certainly created a further expansion to our already attractive set of capital deployment opportunities. We remain disciplined and will not risk the enterprise that we built with blood, sweat and tears, but we remain optimistic that we'll be able to grow our portfolio with well located asset at highly favorable bases and in-place cash flow. To illustrate that point further, we acquired $529 million of asset during first quarter at a great basis and in-place cash flow. The K Street medical office building that we acquired in DC perhaps tells you how favorable the investment environment has become. We continue to see underwriting standards starting meaningfully, leverage levels decline, and banks are now requiring more commercial deposits and more recourse. As a low leveraged buyer, this backdrop is very beneficial for us. Our pipeline today is robust with opportunities to deploy capital across senior housing in all three countries, outpatient medical in the U.S. and data opportunities on the skilled side. Our team remains active and yet highly disciplined and price conscious as always. From a balance sheet standpoint, I wanted to quickly highlight the continued progress we made in terms of leverage and liquidity under Tim's leadership. He will get into more details. But I'm very pleased with significant deleveraging that we have achieved in past year with net debt to EBITDA falling almost a turn to 6.3 with further organic deleveraging going forward. And our ability to source over $1 billion of capital this year in the midst of a very challenging capital markets environment is a testament to the confidence entrusted in us by the banking community, the lenders, our investors and our other partners. With approximately $700 million of the cash on the books and undrawn line of credit, we are not only positioned to endure further capital market volatility, but also to deploy capital as opportunities arise. To summarize our optimism regarding the long-term growth trajectory of the business remains firmly intact. Top-line growth remains strong, expenses are moderating and our external growth opportunities continue to expand. While -- all the while John and his team are making progress in turning our vision of creating a world class operating platform into a reality. And with that, I will turn it over to him for an update on the operational element of the business and build out of the platform. John? Thank you, Tim. While we're very pleased with our quarterly results and our improved outlook, it's a bittersweet moment for us in Toledo as we mourn the passing of George Chapman. George was the former Chairman and CEO of Health Care REIT, Welltower's very sister company, and a gifted person and a visionary in the healthcare real estate space, and perhaps above all, an incredibly kind and generous individual. During his many years at Health Care REIT, George not only served as a leader of the company, but was also mentor and teacher to numerous individuals across the real estate space. He was raised in the Toledo area and always sought opportunities to give back to the community, including his high schools in Miami, and through his service on various boards to strengthen the northeast Ohio region. We are deeply appreciative of all he has done for us and he'll be missed dearly.  Lastly, before we go into Q&A, I wanted to highlight a document which we posted on our website last evening, which was also part of our shareholder letter published a couple of weeks ago. This document contents a set of ground rules or shared principles, which form Welltower's philosophical foundation for long-term compounding through capital allocation, risk mitigation, and culture amongst other factors, and ultimately the most importantly -- ultimately and most importantly, who we seek as our long-term investor partners as we execute our mission of delivering to them superior, absolute and relative total shareholder returns. I will now open up the call for questions. So, Derek, you asked a lot of questions, so I'll try to -- I think I'll try to remember answer the question. Kisco is one of our best operating partners, and there are very significant opportunities to grow with Kisco. Whether that's through transition, that's through acquisition, that's through development, obviously, there's no question that they have absolutely hit it out of the park. So -- and we're having all these conversations going on. As I've mentioned on last quarter's call, I believe that we finally have figured out hopefully how to do transition very creatively as you -- sort of your words, but I think that's a good one. I think, I've given some examples in my script and Oakmont. Let me give you another example. Probably last year, this time, we announced a large set of acquisitions with our partner, StoryPoint. And the first tranche of that acquisition closed in Q3. So, let's think about it. So, these properties -- the first tranche, there's 18 properties, the StoryPoint took over from a -- on the existing operator. At that point, that end of Q2, it had 74% occupancy, call it circa $6.5 million, $6.4 million of NOI, annualized NOI. And nine months later, they started taking this over in July, you would think that through transition, and all of those obviously moving this asset NOI -- that it will be great win, if occupancy and NOI held. Nine months later, today -- not today, end of March and the quarter end, occupancy was at 2%, NOI was $16.2 million. That tells you what a great operator with significant focus can do. So, it is my belief that now you got, obviously, John and his team and with our premium operating partners, who have done this many times over, during the most difficult time of COVID has figured out how to do this extremely well and creatively. I gave you a bunch of examples. We obviously provided more case studies. And we do think that there is significant opportunities to enhance our portfolio by what I said, optimizing four things, right? It's an optimization problem, which is location, product, price point, and operator, right? So, that's what you know, obviously Swagat and Kevin and their team are trying to constantly do, and we're executing that with our premium operating partners. Let me try to address both of those questions, and Nikhil will jump in if I miss anything. Okay? So let's just start with the second question first. We are always greedy when others are fearful, as you know. Where we're finding opportunities, as I mentioned, on my prepared remarks, that we see a substantial -- we have substantial actionable pipeline in seniors housing in all three countries. This is the first time we're seeing opportunities, not just in the U.S., but also in Canada and UK. So, we're very optimistic about senior housing opportunities in all three countries. And we are seeing substantial opportunities, albeit small deals. But as you know, Vikram, we're very focused on individual buying, individual assets, small transactions, outpatient medical in the U.S., right? So, that's sort of -- and we're seeing -- across capital structure, we're seeing opportunities on the debt side, in the skilled side of the business. So, that's sort of where we're seeing opportunities. First question, debt book. If you think about our debt book, you should think about our debt book in three different buckets. But before I get into it, I'll remind you that majority of these loans, right, just call it 80% of the book was originated after COVID. And we try to -- as we have discussed in many of these cases, so let's just talk about three buckets and you will understand. The first bucket is HC-One, you have specific question, I'll get to it. The second bucket is our partnership is related. And as I mentioned in previous call, these developments are structured as a participating means, right? That's the second bucket. Those are majority of the loans. If you take that -- go beyond that, the average size of the loan is like $12 million, right? So, we're focused on -- so let's just talk one at a time. We are very much focused on not just debt, but also last dollar basis of every bid, and possibly as a majority of these cases an equity feature that is attached to that debt. So let's talk about one at a time. We talked about the relative development pipeline, and that's obviously structured as a participating means. By definition that's equity like structure. Second, HC-One, if you go back and see what we said when we did that, that is a whole loan, that is a senior loan, unlike a lot of the things that you see. It is not a mezzanine loan. There is no senior in front of us. We are the senior. The last pound basis of that loan is $32,000 pounds per debt, which tells you how low levered that loan is. But to your question, if we were to take that over, which is we have no intention of, but if we were to take that over, there is no senior loan that sits in front of us, right? Understand our last dollar basis, what the values are in UK. That sort of gives you a sense of what it is. But more importantly, if you go back and see what I said when we did the loan, we have actually a substantial amount of equity behind that in terms of warrants, right? So -- and then you go to the last one, there are some pure debt, there's a lot of participating prep, participating mezz. So, that's sort of the convention of the loan book. So, we are -- we don't land anywhere where we don't think the last dollar is not significantly beneficial to us. We hope the people who borrow from us will do substantially well. And from the equity participating nature of many of these loans, we'll participate with them, not just get a return on and off our capital. Hopefully that's what's helpful for you. And rates are substantial above... So, I'm going to take that -- answer that question in two parts. First is asset management initiative and that asset management initiative that John has with his team, that you are seeing the impact on the agency labor and replacing that agency labor with permanent employees. And John mentioned many other sort of initiative that's going on to attract and retain talent, which would continue to reduce that number. The other side of that, your question is operating platform question. Here today, John is entirely focused on top line and we are seeing some signs of, as I mentioned on my prepared remarks, that we've just moved on few places from drawing board to pilots, and we're seeing some significant successes on leads and other situations that obviously we're not prepared to talk about it, that you're going to see on top line, not on the expenses yet. He will get to the expenses, but he's focused on the big ball today on the revenue side. Okay. Nikhil will walk you through the MOB acquisitions that we did in the quarter. But let me just answer some of the other questions you asked. So, as you think about it, the five sources of capital, we have accessed three of them this quarter. We have done public equity, we have done private equity. We have sold assets and took capital, and very attractive, obviously return. So you can see it, as an example, on slide 12, the case studies that we put together on some of those assets and how we significantly maximize value there. We still have some participation left in that transaction. And the other thing was debt but that was on the secured side. So as you think about menu of capital, don't just think this is public equity and public debt, right, which is obviously the good -- very good source of capital and has been for us, but also think about private source of capital, whether it's joint venture, asset sales and private source of debt. Senior housing is a housing business and we have substantial portfolio under leveraged portfolio in U.S. and in Canada, which has very significant agency support, right? So, this quarter, in U.S., we have executed one transaction. But as you think about capital, think about menu of options, and depending on -- what that manual auction, how it is priced on a given day, we execute and think -- and only think through that use of capital as it relates to what are the returns of that as we deploy the capital back on an unlevered IRR basis, and from the perspective of the long term return. That's just how we invest capital. Nikhil? John, do you want to take that? I'll just add one point of color perhaps. First thing is, Steve, as I mentioned, as you think about pricing power, the initial phase of pricing power has been that our cost has been going up. And obviously, to bring back these communities to a profitable level or the only which -- only way this will actually continue to serve the community if they're profitable, right, over a long period of time is to increase pricing. And as I mentioned in last call that you will see the next 12, 18 months handover from pricing because cost has gone up to pricing power because we have no room to sell, right? And that handover will come. And so the second point is just understand that we're not focused on absolute level of pricing but we are focused on the difference, the delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR. That's what drives P&L, right? So keep those two in mind, and you will see where our focus has been and continue to -- will be. As we think as just understand our portfolio, it's roughly speaking, half and half on an average basis and an average year is January versus throughout the year, right? And so we continue to -- as we roll these leases and market rate continues go up, we expect that pricing will continue to remain strong. Actually, if you look at into the senior housing bucket, you will see that majority of the new capital outlay has been on the wellness side of the house rather than on the senior housing side of the house. So -- and I expect that will absolutely continue. Medical office majority, obviously all of our medical office -- I shouldn't say majority. All of our medical office developments have been 100% pre-leased yield on cost development. So we're not exposed to the cost risk. Some hits in different quarters, so you saw a bunch of them hit this quarter, which we have been working on for many, many years, but we should not expect anything different going forward. And majority of that what is showing up at senior housing development are actually on the wellness side of the house.  Senior housing development as seniors product is very, very hard to make numbers work today. So we're not that focused on that side of the house unless it is a very special project in a very special location, such as some of the related projects that Nikhil talked about. So, we're not going to get on this call about contractual agreements and what kind of different levels of service and situations that might be going. We'll just focus on the fact that we have aligned interest with our operators. As always said, for years and years that the RIDEA 3 or the structures are all about thinking and swimming together, right? And there is substantial upside to many of these portfolios for us, but also for our operating partners. So this is -- we have different types of arrangements with different people. We're not going to obviously get into on this call. But understand, at the end of the day, the goals are very simple. We're trying to create a very good environment for our residents. We're trying to create an environment for our employees to stay and -- turnover, resident satisfaction, employee satisfaction and frankly, owner satisfaction. That's the goal. And if we can match those goals, it will be great for us and it will be great for our operating partners I wish the answer to your question was yes, but the answer is no. Canada is a very tight market with very significant -- a few handful of owners, handful of banks and very significant CMAC presence. So returns in Canada usually are pretty tight. We're seeing opportunities to create value through our great operating partner that's there. UK, we're actually now starting to see very significant returns. We made one investment in UK this quarter, like last quarter. And we are seeing that. So UK returns are good, actually very good. But I will tell you the vast majority of opportunities are in the U.S. And frankly speaking, there -- because it's such a deep and robust pipeline that you can pick your spots and make some significant returns as -- we're seeing the unlevered IRRs in the senior space today without getting into which country -- what return for which country, but roughly speaking, I'll say, close to double digits. We're seeing opportunities that are in the double digits. Medical office today, IRR opportunities are 8.5% plus, I would say. And obviously, we are very focused on sort of participating debt structures in the SNF side where we can create high-teen returns despite using some debt and some equity like features that I talked about in probably in the high-teens. So that's kind of our focus. We're purely return driven. We're purely basis driven. And all we are trying to do is we're trying to figure out where can we add value, not through just financial capital, but those four things I talked about. It's an optimization problem, right? It's an optimization problem of location, product, price point and operator. That's how you make money in this business. And that's how we're trying to create value. So I was trying to add value -- added color to the question that previously was asked. Tim already gave you our view of RevPOR increase as we sit today, right, 6.3% increase that we talked about. So, I was trying to provide more color as we think about long term. Long term, we're focused on the spread between RevPOR and ExpPOR. By no means, I'm trying to say that we're seeing anything in that sort of -- around us that says that pricing power is cooling down. In fact, it's powerful. And I think John probably mentioned that. All I was trying to point out that long term without thinking about is it 6%, is it 12%, is it 3%? The way you're going to get the P&L right, which is ultimately what we are focused on, is the spread between that RevPOR and ExpPOR, right? So, that's what I was trying to answer. We do think that we'll see significant pricing power continue, as I mentioned, half of our portfolio gets renewed at different points in the anniversary cycle and street trade continues to go up. Hope that's helpful. Let me try to take the first one, and John, why don't you take the second one? As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, assisted living continued to significantly outperform independent living. The only thing I was trying to highlight that after underperformance, independent living is starting to pick up, particularly in Canada. And that's what we are seeing starting to come through our Canadian numbers, right? But if you just look at an absolute performance between the two, there is no question that assisted living has been outperforming. And if economy continues to weaken, on a given rolling 12 to 18-month period, my guess is that it will continue to outperform very significantly, given the need-driven nature of the business. Also, UK is at the sort of the earlier stages of normalizing labor cost. So, it's the addition of UK that it makes it look like the comp has gone up. But if you look at on a same-store basis of -- not a same-store basis, but the same pool of fourth quarter, you will see it was relatively the same. So, I'll try to address first part of your question. So, acuity actually went off I would say, in 2020, right? If you didn't absolutely need it, you would avoid the product pre-vaccine. So we obviously have seen acuity gone up in 2020, but since then, we have seen acuity sort of normalize. So, I'm not sure that I subscribe to this idea that acuity across the board for the industry has been going up. In fact, someone just asked earlier in the question pool about Kisco. I was with the Kisco team last week and Kisco's CEO was talking to me that acuity -- they have seen acuity actually gone down, right? So probably gone down for some, gone up for some, but I do believe that acuity has normalized from that 2020 peak levels as we have seen vaccine come into play. You want to answer the second?"

            "name": "Tim McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2023 results, performance of our triple-net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet and liquidity update, and finally our updated full year 2023 outlook. Welltower reported first quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.05 per diluted share, and normalized funds from operations of $0.85 per diluted share, representing a 4% year-over-year growth and 13% growth after adjusting for the year-over-year impact from a stronger dollar and higher base rates on floating rate debt. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 11% year-over-year. Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 0.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage is 0.86 times in the quarter. Next same-store NOI on our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 4.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.33 times. Turning to capital market activity. In the quarter we raised $413 million through our ATM program, which helped fund accretive investment activity during the quarter and maintain debt to EBITDA at 6.31 times at quarter end, a substantial decrease from 7.1 times at 3/31/2022. In March, we swapped $350 million of our $1 billion 2027 floating rate term loan to a fixed rate of 5.335% through March of '24, bringing floating rate debt to 13.6% of total debt and just 4% of consolidated enterprise value as of quarter end. We ended the quarter with $639 million of cash, full capacity under $4 billion revolving line of credit and $393 million of expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan pay-downs, representing $5 billion in near-term available liquidity. Over the last 12 months, we've seen leverage meaningfully improve from its post COVID peak, reaching the first quarter of 2022. As our senior housing operating NOI has started to recover, we have experienced beginning stages of a cash flow growth driven deleveraging. And we have amplified this organic leverage reduction, the disciplined approach to capitalization of our external growth pipeline. The result of this approach is a balance sheet that in its current form is poised to be substantially lower levered than it was pre-COVID as we continue to see senior housing operating environment recover. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance. Last night we updated our previously issued full year 2023 outlook, the net income attributable to common stockholders to a range of $0.57 to $0.72 per diluted share, and normalized FFO of $3.39 to $3.54 per diluted share or $3.465 at the midpoint. Our updated normalized FFO guidance represents $0.025 increase at the midpoint from our previously issued guidance. This increase in guidance is reflective of $0.02 of fundamental outperformance, mainly from our senior housing operating segment, roughly $0.005 of which is from subsidies received in Q1 and a $0.005 from investment activity completed in Q1. Underlying this FFO guidance is an increased estimate of total portfolio year-over-year same store NOI growth of 9% to 13%, driven by sub-segment growth of outpatient medical 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute 3% to 4%, senior housing triple-net 1% to 3%, and finally increased senior housing operating growth of 17% to 24% year-over-year. The midpoint of which is driven by better than expected expense trends to start the year, along with year-over-year growth expectations of revenue, approximately 9.5%. Underlying this revenue growth is expectation of approximately 230 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth from approximately 6.3%. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. I'll just quickly add on the two related projects that have delivered New York and San Francisco. New York senior housing opened in January of this year, and so four months in occupancy is beyond where we underwrote at the end of the first year. And San Francisco, which has been over -- open for about a year, is also ahead of underwriting... Exactly. So, we -- as we've talked about in the past, there's kind of two prongs to which we get the balance sheet back to the range, pre-COVID range, target range of 5.5 times to 6 times leverage. And the main one is just seeing NOI recover back to pre-COVID levels. We've been pretty clear in that, that that shouldn't be taken as a stated goal of where NOI and those assets sit, just more so a marker on the ground of where NOI actually was in those assets. And then what the impact, both on earnings and leverage would be just to get it back to that level. And then obviously, we plan to get well beyond that. So think about our current leverage profile. Part of our deleveraging from 7.1% last year has been driven by the kind of beginning stages of that NOI recovery. And then, as we've capitalized our external growth pipeline, we've continued to be pretty disciplined about the way that we've capitalized at the equity. And so, we've driven down current leverage much faster than what -- if it had just been purely through organic cash flow recovery. So now sitting at 6.3 times leverage this quarter, if you were to layer on kind of just a recovery of NOI back to pre-COVID levels, you get down to around 5 times flat. So that's kind of the comment on seeing expectation that if you just take our current capital structure, we knew nothing and you continue to see NOI recover back to pre-COVID levels, you'll see us get to a leverage level that's well below where we would have been or where we were pre-COVID. Yes. Thanks, Nick. So, the transaction costs you're referencing, so other expenses, which is predominantly transaction costs, think about that being, as I described in the footnote, non-capitalizable transaction costs, a lot of that tends to be dead deal cost. So, tough to predict kind of how that comes through. We're a pretty active firm. I'd say that's stepped up a bit this quarter just because of -- as we've talked about and as Shankh has highlighted on a few prior calls. Our underwriting standards have picked up a bit, and we've seen cost increase. So, you think about some developments that we've gotten beyond kind of early stage development spend and we think in a fairly disciplined manner walked away from. So if we kind of look forward, similar to the way we don't try to guide to acquisition cost, we try to have flexible framework is how we think about acquisition volume. Flexible framework is how we think about investing dollars. And the same goes for -- as we pursue things with the intent to move forward, if we end up not moving forward with them, they could not coming to this line item. But it's not something that we kind of have -- we've made decisions on right now or else it would be coming through this quarter. Yes, Michael. So, the -- what we've provided is the pool change. I think one thing you're noting is that we've seen kind of export pick up from fourth quarter to the first quarter. And we gave the number on what first quarter would have been based on the fourth quarter pool, as you noted in the footnote. And then just on the pickup in general, the reported same-store number in 4Q, 1Q, it's actually because we continue to expand the same-store pool. So, you've got 95% of our operational properties that we've owned for more than four quarters in our same-store pool now and a lot of the transitions that came in were from the UK. And U.K., we've just seen expense growth run higher than the rest of the portfolio, largely driven by utilities, which we've talked about a lot on this call. So, some of the increase you're seeing just in 1Q is from that mix shift and inclusion of more UK properties. Yes. So, I'll start with your first question on senior housing and John can add any color on the MOB side. So for senior housing, yes, you're correct. We came in -- our first quarter results were better than expected as far as how agency came down. And of course, some of that benefit gets netted out with full-time employees coming on, but net-net, we ended up in a more favorable spot for compensation. And as I kind of noted in my guidance outlook, that's largely what's moving our outlook for the year is just a better trend coming out of Q1 on expenses with that being the main piece and the assumption revenue kind of holds given that we're moving into the revenue building months as we speak."

The result was a 21% increase in FFO per share and our fourth guidance raised for the year, this time by $0.13 per share, reflecting the extraordinary strength of our platform. This quarter also marks the first time in our company\u2019s history in which our quarterly revenue exceeded $2 billion. In terms of the senior housing operating portfolio, results continue to surpass our already high expectations. Year-over-year same-store NOI growth came in at 23%, eight consecutive quarters in which the growth exceeded 20%. And, despite macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened geopolitical tensions, topline growth on a same-store basis remain resilient at 9% driven by another quarter of outsized occupancy growth of 310 basis points coupled with strong rate growth. Particularly noteworthy is the 160 basis points of sequential spot-to-spot occupancy growth that we experienced, a reflection of both strong tailwinds of our business and especially our operating platform initiative, which will continue to bear fruit in the coming quarters and years. Not only we\u2019re pleased with the sequential growth, but the occupancy run rate exiting the quarter solidly exceeded the prior year and early fourth quarter results have been positive as well. Additionally, I would be remiss not to mention that the spread between RevPOR or unit revenue and ExpPOR or unit expense remains at historically wide level. This trend resulted in another 300 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion of our SHO portfolio. As we have discussed in the past, we remain focused on the delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR, not the absolute levels. Overall, we are delighted with our results and believe that we\u2019re carrying significant momentum into 2025 as tailwinds which we have lifted our business over the past couple of years continue to strengthen. As I have described in our recent calls, the backdrop of our senior housing business is only getting better as growth of 80 plus population picks up from here. Starting next year, 5,000 Americans will turn 80 every day. And remember, that we\u2019re only at the front end of this trend with the crest of the silver tsunami not being seen until well into the future. And, what is also irrefutable is the favorable supply outlook. Construction starts continue to drop and in the third quarter reached the second lowest level on record after the second quarter of 2009. Banks continue to wind down their senior housing loan exposure and have been reluctant to put new capital to work. And, given the extended timeline to build a new senior living community in our market, which we detailed on Slide 19 of our business update, we may not face the impact of new supply in our markets for years. Frankly, in today\u2019s construction cost and financing cost environment, it makes no economic sense to build. We have had couple of years of solid growth, but we believe that we are still in the very early stages of an extended period of extraordinary growth for the senior housing sector. And, without stealing John\u2019s thunder, this end market demand growth will be amplified by the rollout of our operating platform. I\u2019m delighted to report that during the quarter we went live with our tech platform at our first set of properties along with preparing to broaden and accelerate the rollout in the near-term. Beyond the technology rollout, we expect our broader operating platform initiatives including our hands on asset management to have a compounding effect on our portfolio\u2019s outperformance. Shifting to capital deployment, the only change we have observed since our last call is that the opportunity set has expanded farther. We announced another $1.2 billion of transaction completed or under contract since our last quarterly update, bringing our total year-to-date investment activity to over $6 billion. Nikhil will provide you more details, but as with the past few quarters, most of our investments have been bolt-on acquisitions within senior housing sector improving and benefiting from our already established regional density. Our goal remains to go deep in our markets, not broad. While 2024 is shaping out to be a record year for Welltower in terms of capital deployment, we continue to unearth compelling opportunities across all property types, geographies and capital structure and expect a busy Q4 and Q1. Lastly, I will quickly reiterate that through the exceptional cash flow growth we have achieved this year and prudent funding of our investment activity, our balance sheet has strengthened meaningfully. With leverage at 3.7 times and nearly $10 billion of liquidity, we remain well-positioned to address all near-term obligations and capitalize attractive investment opportunities. And, as we have created flexibility to lean in to the balance sheet to drive further growth at opportune time. To sum it up, we\u2019re starting to see the Lollapalooza effect of cyclical, secular and structural growth driven by our operating platform, which will be further enhanced by bolt-on acquisitions and balance sheet optimization to drive meaningful partial growth. We are singularly focused on this long-term compounding of our partial earnings growth for existing owners, our true North Star. We cannot be distracted, discouraged or dissuaded. With that, I will turn the call over to, John.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh, and good morning, everyone. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, we posted another quarter of fantastic results with no let up and momentum, which continues to build across the business. Before getting into the details, I\u2019ll echo Shankh\u2019s sentiment that we\u2019re looking forward to closing out the year on a strong note and excited for another period of solid growth in 2025 and beyond. During the quarter, total portfolio same-store NOI increased 12.6% versus the year ago period, once again led by our senior housing operating portfolio. First, I\u2019ll provide an update on our Outpatient Medical business, which posted year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 2.2%. The consistency of the business remains evident with healthy leasing activity during the period and another quarter of strong tenant retention. Same-store occupancy remained stable at an industry leading 94.5%. As for the Senior Housing business, the business continues to deliver exceptional results. Demand for needs-based product is clearly on the rise and our proactive asset management initiatives, which I\u2019ll get into shortly, are unquestionably delivering Alpha. In the third quarter, portfolio achieved year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 23%, once again exceeding our expectations and allowing us to yet again raise our full-year outlook, which Tim will describe shortly. The strength in our Senior Housing business was broad-based with solid occupancy gains experienced across all our geographies and property types. It\u2019s worth repeating that while the summer months typically represent the most active period of leasing during the year, our sequential same-store occupancy gain of 120 basis points and spot-to-spot gain of 160 basis points are well above typical seasonal trends. In fact, this quarter tied a record for sequential same-store occupancy growth when excluding the second half of 2021 as we were coming out of the building. On a year-over-year basis, same-store occupancy increased 310 basis points, also amongst the highest levels ever achieved in our history. Rate growth across the portfolio also remained strong with same-store RevPOR growth increasing 4.9% year-over-year. While our budgeting process for next year is just starting, we believe that rate growth should once again remain favorable as portfolio vacancies decline further and our pricing initiatives begin to bear fruit, more to come in the coming months. In terms of expenses, we continue to be encouraged by trends within the labor market and further moderation of broader inflationary pressures. ExpPOR or expense per occupied room increased just 0.7% year-over-year, second lowest level in our history. Most importantly though, as Shankh mentioned, the spread between RevPOR and ExpPOR growth remains historically wide, contributing to another quarter of substantial operating margin expansion, at 26.5%, the NOI margin for our same-store portfolio remains below pre-COVID levels, but we expect continued improvement going forward as the operating leverage inherent in the business is recognized. The other big driver of future margin expansion will be our operating platform. Our operating platform includes a technology platform and other site level technology, an internal capital team, which I referenced last quarter, our data science capabilities and more. I continue to recruit top talent and build out various capabilities that we leverage with our operators and our asset management team across our portfolio to deliver Alpha. During our last call, I mentioned that we would soon be going live with our first technology platform in Q3, launching an end-to-end tech platform with our first operator. I\u2019m pleased to report that through the dedicated efforts of the Welltower team and our operator, it has been very successful for all stakeholders. The customer experience is a modern digital experience, substantially simplifying and shortening the move-in process for the family and the residents by eliminating paperwork. The employee experience has improved dramatically as we have simplified and or automated the processes as well as providing employees with important real-time data ensuring top care for our customers. As a result of the technology platform, the Executive Directors are saving five hours per move-in and enabling them more time for leadership and to focus on our customers. Additionally, potential errors are being avoided due to the singular database for the various modules, meaning that data is only input once, so there are no inconsistencies in the spelling of a customer\u2019s name or other critical care information. And finally, we deliver the technology platform at a lower cost than the combined disparate systems being replaced. At this point, we\u2019re preparing to roll out the tech platform to additional operators in the near-term. While we have a long way to go, we\u2019re excited by our initial success, which would not have been possible without the hard work and buy in from our best-in-class operating partners and the many Welltower team members who are working tirelessly on this effort. To sum it up, it was another strong quarter for Welltower between solid operating performance and our accomplishments on various operations and asset management initiatives. While it\u2019s too early to speak to the outlook for 2025 with any detail, we remain as optimistic as ever on the growth prospects of our business as the demand supply backdrop for senior housing is only strengthening and the benefits of the operating platform begin to be realized in a more meaningful way. We continue to execute on our mission to improve the experience of senior housing residents and employees. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Nikhil.\nNikhil Chaudhri: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that our investment activity and pipeline remain incredibly robust, visible and actionable. Over the past three months since our last call, we have either acquired or entered into agreements to acquire an additional $1.2 billion of assets. This is a fraction of the $15 billion plus of opportunities that we consider during this time frame. These incremental transactions bring our year-to-date investment activity to a record setting $6.1 billion. This growth underscores the strength of our market position and the abundance of opportunities we\u2019re pursuing. As always, our focus and excitement are driven by the expected attractive risk adjusted returns of our transaction activity rather than the deal volume. Acquiring quality assets at a reasonable basis with significant cash flow growth prospects remain at the core of our investment strategy. In the third quarter, we closed on $2.15 billion of transactions. Our activity remains granular with Q3 closings spanning 15 different transactions across 13 different operating partners and a medium transaction size of $56 million. Our Q3 transactions were heavily focused on our seniors and wellness housing businesses, where we added 40 properties and more than 5,200 units. We acquired these assets, which have an average age of just over five years, at $244,000 per unit at a significant discount for replacement cost. We expect our transactions that close this quarter to stabilize in the mid-to-high 7s yield and generate an unlevered IRR in excess of 10%. Our team\u2019s reputation, expertise and network continue to drive our success. An impressive 94% of our investment volume by dollars this quarter was acquired through off market transactions. This approach has allowed us to source opportunities from a diverse range of sellers, including six transactions from developers facing maturing construction loans, three from foreign counterparties, including two from Asia and one from Central or from Continental Europe, four transactions with repeat counterparties, highlighting our reputation as a fair and reliable partner. I\u2019d like to quickly reflect on the macroeconomic trends we have witnessed recently. Despite the 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed, the 10 year treasury yield has increased by over 60 basis points since the announced cut as market participants are now wrestling with the likelihood of long rates staying higher for longer. We laid the case out for this scenario in detail on our last call. The impact of the rate cut to borrowers with floating rate debt is de minimis as they still face debt maturity challenges as bank lenders continue to reduce their senior housing exposure. 3Q earnings results for many banks that have historically been active in the senior space focused on highlighting their desire to continue to reduce their exposure to our sector. Agency financing also remained challenging due to limited stable product and elevated DSCR requirements and higher long-term rates. It\u2019s not surprising that with this backdrop, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s origination volumes are down 91% and 71%, respectively, versus their pre-pandemic peaks. This constrained lending environment continues to create attractive investment opportunities for us. On the back of this environment, we are engaged in direct bilateral conversations with eight of our highly respective private peers to evaluate significant portions of their portfolios for potential acquisitions. We are also seeing an increase in interest from sellers requesting to take Welltower OP units in transaction consideration in lieu of cash. This allows those exiting their asset level positions to have a mechanism for continuing to participate in the strong tailwinds of our industry, but in a manner not constrained by an unforgiving capital structure and with our best-in-business operating partners backed by Welltower\u2019s operating platform. This proactive and collaborative approach underscores our commitment to continuing to unlock interesting opportunities while conducting business in a first class and mutually beneficial manner. In conclusion, in this volatile capital markets environment, we remain focused on leveraging our expertise and data science platform with our operating partners and peer relationships to capitalize on attractive opportunities to create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our team. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Tim, to walk through our financial results.\nTimothy McHugh: Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our third quarter results, performance of our triple-net investment segment, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update and finally, an update to our full-year 2024 outlook. Welltower reported third quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.73 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $1.11 per diluted share, representing 20.7% year-over-year growth. We also reported year-over-year total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 12.6%. Now, turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage stats reported a quarter in arrears. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12-months ending [6/30/2024] (ph). In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 5.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.09 times, marking a new post-COVID high in coverage. Coverage in this portfolio continues to improve above pre-pandemic levels and greater than expected growth in this portfolio is being driven mainly by improving underlying fundamentals and leases currently on a cash basis. Next, same-store NOI in our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage of 1.74 times. Moving on to capital activity. In July, we issued a $1.035 billion convertible note due in 2029. We intend to use the proceeds for the note to address our 2025 unsecured maturities coming due in the second quarter of next year. We continue to equity finance our investment activity in the quarter, raising $1.2 billion of gross proceeds at an average price of $122 per share. This allowed us to fund $2 billion in net investment activity and end the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash and restricted cash from the balance sheet. Staying with the balance sheet, we ended this quarter with 3.73 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. And, even after completing $1.5 billion incremental net investment activity, we expect to end the year below four times net debt to EBITDA, which would represent over a one turn improvement relative to the end of 2023. This level of deleveraging is being achieved despite deploying a record amount of capital. Our cash flow capitalization of acquisitions and the significant increase in our cash flow generation allowed us to build a powerful asset that will allow us to prudently fund future investments and enhance our go-forward cash flow per share growth. To illustrate the substantial increase in balance capacity, as Shankh mentioned earlier, our annualized revenue exceeded $8.2 billion this quarter. This signifies a $3.2 billion increase compared to the end of 2019, while our net debt has decreased by $2.7 billion during that same period, reflecting a 20% decrease from COVID levels, concurrent with a 60% revenue increase over that same period. It is noteworthy that our current debt stack includes $2.1 billion in convertible notes that are in the money. This deleveraging should be amplified through the embedded upside within our senior housing operating portfolio, further bolstering balance sheet capacity and providing for increased flexibility and optionality. Lastly, as I turn to our updated 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not included any investment activity in our outlook beyond the $6.1 billion to-date that has been closed or publicly announced. Last night, we updated our full-year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to $1.75 to $1.81 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $4.27 to $4.33 per diluted share or $4.30 at the midpoint. Our updated normalized FFO guidance represents a $0.13 per share increase at the midpoint from our previously issued guidance. This increase is composed of $0.06 from an improved NOI outlook in our senior housing operating portfolio, $0.015 from taxes and FX, $0.01 from performance in our triple-net and OM segments and $0.045 from accretive capital activity. Underlying this increased FFO per share guidance is an increase in estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth to 11.5% to 13%, driven by sub-segment growth of outpatient medical 2% to 3% long-term post-acute 2% to 3% senior housing triple-net 4% to 5% and finally, increased senior housing operating growth of 22% to 24%. This is driven by the following midpoints in their respective ranges: revenue growth of 9.2%, made up of RevPOR growth of 5.25% and year-over-year occupancy growth of 300 basis points and expense growth of 5%. And with that, we\u2019ll hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. As many of you, my fellow shareholders know that my team and I are true believers that compounding is the only way to create substantial long-term value. Compounding not just in the context of middle school math, but in everything in life. We define compounding as dogged, incremental and continuous progress over a very long period of time. And for this team, it has been close to a decade since we took our predecessor company down to a start by turning over roughly 60% of the portfolio, changing out 95% of our human capital in middle management and up, evolving our operating partners while creating greater alignment through win-win structures and so on. More importantly, we change these companies culture as we build what you know as Welltower today, brick-by-brick. We founded a culture of owners not managers with agency problems, a culture or shared value with our operating partners to deliver real value for our customers and site level employees shoulder-to-shoulder no matter what. A culture of resilience having endured four different crisis over last past decade, crisis included oversupply, a crippling pandemic, labor shortage and the worst inflation in 40 years. A culture of extreme excellence to build and create true residual Alpha for our owners not defined by Wall Street\u2019s view of real estate industry which has a checkered history of creating value. We\u2019re focused on creating Alpha, not levered beta for existing owners. Over the past decade, we have built a unique data science platform, the first of its kind in real estate industry, powered initially by machine learning, then deep learning and finally by AI well before many of these terms got into the folklore. And finally, with Chutzpah and perhaps Na\u00efvet\u00e9, we launched an operating platform initiative by attracting John and hundreds of our new colleagues who followed him from a dozen industries of higher standards during a pandemic no less when we didn\u2019t even know if the business would survive. I sat down this past weekend to reflect on our Q3 results and for the first time since I arrived at Welltower, I felt a sense of satisfaction in that the compounding of our efforts over the course of many years is beginning to pay off. Not because of the strong results we posted in the quarter, but because of a feeling that our audacious dream of transforming this industry is finally coming together and what that may potent for next few years. Having said that, this feeling lasted for about five minutes as my usual healthy paranoia set in. We have a long journey ahead and frankly that our pursuit of dogged incremental and continuous progress will never be over. Mediocrity and complacency have no place in our culture. Like Navy SEALs, we believe the only easy day was yesterday. Where occasionally in moments like this, looking at the scoreboard may not be so bad, we\u2019re in this game because of our love for the game. And with that, we\u2019ll be back to the game. Operator, please open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Hughes: Hi there. Thank you for the time and great to see the strong results. Hoping you could talk more about the historically wide gap between, unit revenue and unit expense and margins and specifically trying to understand the incremental margin at today\u2019s 86% occupancy and where that incremental margin goes once occupancy surpasses 90% or even higher since variable costs at that point are minimal? Thank you.\nTimothy McHugh: Thanks, Jonathan. So, you\u2019re right in highlighting that the way that, that kind of RevPOR, ExpPOR math is expressed through our financials is in that flow through margin. So last quarter, we noted that flow through margins had gone above 60% for the first time since the kind of post-COVID recovery. Again, this quarter, we were in the low-60s from a flow through. Important to note in that, that we had one operator making about 1% of our same-store pool that through some kind of changes to their operating model they\u2019re implementing and higher expenses right now than we\u2019d expect. So, ex that operator, flow through margins would have been closer to 67%. So, consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past, you should see flow through margins kind of move into the mid-60s and approach 70% as we start to re-approach kind of pre-COVID levels of occupancy of 88% and then from thereon improve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Nick Joseph here with Michael. Shankh, you had made the comment that it makes no economic sense to build. And, I know it\u2019s hard to generalize and obviously it\u2019s regional, but I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of kind of how far off we are before it does make economic sense either from a rent growth perspective or costs coming down, just trying to quantify that a bit? Thank you.\nShankh Mitra: Nick, really good question. It\u2019s hard to say in a general matter because cost is a function of local situations, labor etcetera. We haven\u2019t seen construction costs come down. You have seen some material costs have come down which has been surpassed obviously taken up more by insurance and labor costs. So, if you just want to sort of have a general rule of thumb, remember rent growth will not get you there. Rent growth relative to labor cost, operating labor cost growth will get you there, right. So, you need in markets 25%, 30% increase of RevPOR minus ExpPOR where construction will start to make sense. I always believe people will do what make economic sense and we have tried to make it work in the best location where pricing is not a question, even we\u2019re struggling with that. That\u2019s the best locations such as Palm Beach and Cupertino\u2019s of the world. Imagine your question is that average of the industry where this makes no economic sense whatsoever.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, just a quick one from me. So, I\u2019ve been sort of reflecting over this top line growth of 8% where you got over 300 basis points occupancy gain, but, 5% sort of, pricing growth which is basically the fastest out of any rates that we cover. And I think we\u2019re all trying to figure out what that number is going to look like in 2025. So, I guess my question would be, as you sort of reflect on that number, maybe a little bit more color of what drives that. Is there anything sort of one timing? And not putting words in your mouth, but is there a reason that we should expect that to decelerate as we flip the calendar? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Ron, very good question. We\u2019re not going to sit here and try to speculate what 2025 will look like. I\u2019m going to point out a couple of things. John made a specific comment in his prepared remarks about how he\u2019s feeling about pricing. We\u2019ll see what the market gives us. I will tell you that we would get we would have market share increase. So, we\u2019ll but at the end of the day, everybody is subject to market. We are focused on RevPOR minus ExpPOR, not RevPOR. Having said that, you can focus on what John said in his prepared remarks. I will remind you from an occupancy standpoint, remember revenue is a function of pricing and occupancy. I\u2019m going to refocus you what I\u2019ve said on the last call. And I said occupancy can not necessarily saying it will, but can get growth, can get better next year. And hopefully after this record sequential occupancy change in third quarter of this year that gives you probably gives more credence to the comment I made. I\u2019m willing to sit about that much. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful, but just understand it\u2019s too early to say. We\u2019ll see what market gives us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nic Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. Yes, just following up on the topic of occupancy, maybe Shankh or John. Can you just talk a little bit about what you saw in the quarter in terms of traffic trends, maybe year-over-year sequentially? And also how if there\u2019s if you feel like you\u2019re getting an even bigger benefit right now from lower turnover in the portfolio?\nJohn Burkart: Yes, I\u2019ll jump in. Traffic is up, addition with what we saw is higher closing ratios. In other words, our execution is improving, which is important and it\u2019s a function of the operating platform there. As it relates to turnover, that\u2019s been consistent, no issues there. But the bigger issue is we\u2019re executing and taking market share.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks. Shankh, you highlighted that you\u2019re carrying significant momentum into \u201825 and kind of the tailwinds in the business continue to strengthen. Soon speaking kind of the demographics, but at the same time I think absorption has been stable in recent quarters across the sector. So, just curious if you think we\u2019re at the cusp of absorption reaccelerating and that being kind of going back to your comment about occupancy growth potentially getting better next year?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. Austin, I\u2019m not going to comment on what may or may not happen in the macro. Absorption is a macro industry-wide phenomena. As John just mentioned that we\u2019re focused on market share. You can see what our sequential occupancy growth is relative to the industry, that you will see that we\u2019re entirely focused on using our operating platform and our best-in-class operators hard work to get market share, right. If we can get improvement in absorption, that\u2019ll be a gravy. That\u2019s just not something we can control. That\u2019s not something we\u2019re focused on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is [George] (ph) on for Vikram. So, you have highlighted an expanded visible, acquisition pipeline. Can you just provide more color on how much of the flow is non-US? And then as a follow-up, what percentage of the deal flow do you pass and say no to? And has that percentage changed recently?\nJohn Burkart: [George] (ph), on the second question, in my prepared remarks, I talked about how of the $1.2 billion of incremental activity we announced this quarter, the universe of opportunities we looked at was $15 billion. So, from the $15 billion we acquired $1.2 billion. This number fluctuates up or down every quarter depending on what we look at. But generally speaking, it\u2019s roughly a 10% hit rate. And then your second question about geographically, I think Shankh said it in his remarks, but we\u2019ve got active transactions we\u2019re looking at in all three months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pawlowski: Great. Thanks for the time. Question on CapEx for the senior housing business. It\u2019s been running 30% to 45% of NOI over the last year and change. Just curious, over the next two to three years, I know there\u2019s kind of unstabilized NOI that\u2019s nominator, but over the next two to three years, where do you expect CapEx as a percentage of NOI for the senior housing business to start to stabilize at?\nJohn Burkart: Yes. So, I\u2019ll step in. John, the question is let me give you a broader answer here. So, as I mentioned last time, we\u2019ve created an internal team. We\u2019re executing at amazing levels where we\u2019re both reducing the cost by 20% to 50% on, say, a unit basis and speeding up the time lines. We\u2019re also changing the fundamental way we do things. Historically, this business is really the operators function kind of like on the PE model where it\u2019s very short time decisions. So, for example, you might have an asset that has three buildings and they\u2019ll do one roof. And then the next year following roof and the following year following roof. What that\u2019s doing is driving up costs dramatically because of smaller projects, because of three mobilizations. And then you have all kinds of other stuff flowing through like the roof leaks impacting the customer experience and all the issues along those lines. So, what\u2019s happening right now is we\u2019re doing things correctly with the long-term life cycle costs in mind, lowering the long-term run rate. So that means we\u2019re pulling some things forward and it won\u2019t change it will lower the long term run rate. But right now, there\u2019s some stuff that\u2019s elevated because in that example, we\u2019d be doing all three roofs, avoiding the future roof leaks and getting the project behind us and moving forward. So, there\u2019s a little noise that\u2019s going on right now, but it\u2019s all for the efforts to lower the long-term run rate and the unit costs are dramatically lower. So, it\u2019s just absolute great execution by the team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Yes, thanks. Can you guys provide some color on the tech platform rollout that you mentioned? And I know that you have other initiatives that you\u2019re working on. But how does this work out financially? I\u2019m assuming Welltower has made the initial investment to build out these platforms. I mean, are your operators paying a recurring fee for this or just does it get reflected into significantly better financial results for you as these get rolled out to your operating partners?\nTimothy McHugh: Yes, Mike. The goal is clearly the latter part of your question, so significantly better financial results. How I would describe kind of the flow of the cost is you\u2019re right. The initial investment is coming through Welltower. There\u2019s a bit of duplicative cost upfront because as we kind of transition into this, you have a legacy technology systems of operators moving over to our own. In the end, this isn\u2019t intended to be a cost savings exercise, but it will be the tech stack will be less expensive because it will be scaled across our entire operating platform rather than subscale across all of our operators. And that\u2019ll come through over time. But beyond the investment, the initial thought should be there shouldn\u2019t be an uptick in costs.\nShankh Mitra: Mike, just remember one of the things we have to think through, just in addition to what Tim said that software cost is already part of the SHOP margins, right? So, there is cost flowing through our P&L and it\u2019s duplicative in nature today because obviously you have to make a lot of initial or upfront cost. But just as a run rate cost, remember that technology cost is part of the SHOP expense stack.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, thank you. Maybe a question for Nikhil. You mentioned talking to eight private peers. Just hoping you can maybe add a little color on that. Is that larger scale transactions or more of the singles and doubles you\u2019ve been doing today?\nNikhil Chaudhri: Yes. Juan, as you would imagine, right, when you\u2019re talking to eight different groups, from some of those, you might not look to buy any assets either you don\u2019t like the asset quality or the valuation. And with some, you might see eye to eye on a lot. Right? So, it\u2019s hard to generalize, but just given the numbers we\u2019re talking about, the different range of outcomes that everyone we\u2019re speaking with.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. I guess I was looking at your business presentation update, the path to recovery slide on page 21. So, the bridge assumes you go back to pre-COVID occupancy and margin at today\u2019s rate. That seems like it\u2019s a little kind of unrealistic just given the forward-looking backdrop. I guess, how should we think about what else gets layered in beyond this to kind of get to like a bridge? And then maybe tying that into the tech cost you flagged as being part of the SHOP expenses, like how should we think about that influencing this bridge?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. Josh, it\u2019s a good catch that if you just look at the page of what we\u2019re trying to give you a sense of what occupancy growth, how that impacts obviously our NOI embedded NOI growth. Going back to pre-COVID, I\u2019ve said this before, if we only go back to pre-COVID, at least John and I are stepping down. We consider that as a complete failure. So, we expect that occupancy growth occupancy will go substantially higher than where the pre-COVID is. However, the most important point is what you made is at today\u2019s rate. Remember what should be added if we\u2019re just trying to understand what\u2019s a normalized earnings for this company, what you should add, not just whatever you think is the frictional vacancy of our portfolio should be, that\u2019s obviously one add. You have to decide how long it takes there to get obviously get to that frictional vacancy. And meanwhile in those years, what\u2019s your RevPOR minus ExpPOR, because our rates are growing faster than our expense growth, right? That adds to that. And just also point out that we will see that our first set of numbers we gave you few years ago when we started giving you the disclosure, that pool of assets, our NOI is actually $33 million higher than pre-COVID. Occupancy is significantly lower, yet it is $33 million higher. You\u2019ll see that in I believe the fourth bar on that page and that\u2019s because rates are much higher, right? So, you have RevPOR minus ExpPOR got you to that higher NOI despite lower occupancy and that same thing follows through as you are thinking about whatever to whatever your definition of frictional vacancy is. And that\u2019s how you sort of get to the number. We\u2019re not going to sit here and try to quantify what technology costs may or may not come down. That\u2019s not the focus. We think we\u2019re after the big ball, which is revenue. There is a lot of opportunity on the expense side, as we implement systems and processes and have site level employees focus on why to what they have signed up to do, which is providing care. That\u2019s a compassionate care is why they have signed up to be in this industry. So, we want to try to make people\u2019s life easier. As John pointed out, just one example, our tech suite rollout, it\u2019s saving about five hours of effort, far moving from an executive director\u2019s perspective, right? So, that she can focus on what she signed up to do, which is leading people and providing care to families, right? Care to residents and focusing on the resident and their families. So, you think about it, this is not just a question of cost. When we talk about margins, I don\u2019t want you to think about cost. I want you to think about how we improve overall resident and employee experience and what that means for residents\u2019 willingness and ability to pay. Thank you very much for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kilichowski: Hi, thank you. Just one on the transaction market, it feels like you\u2019re competing on your own with some of these deals. Could you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the way of capital flows and when you expect composition to start to pick up? Just trying to understand the likelihood of you being able to maintain the sort of cadence on investment activity?\nShankh Mitra: Let me start and Nikhil you jump in. First, we\u2019re not trying to maintain the level of activity. I have said this before, our company is not designed to buy stuff. We\u2019re not a bunch of deal junkies. We\u2019re trying to invest capital to further strengthening our market position and drive partial earnings and cash flow growth. So, if the market opportunity is there, we\u2019ll do it. If the market opportunity is not there, we\u2019ll not do it. If we believe the market prices have gone to a level where somebody is willing to pay more for assets than what we are willing to pay for, we\u2019ll sell like you have seen pre-COVID we have sell $15 billion of assets. The focus is on value creation on a partial basis for existing shareholders. Having said that, if you have 94% for example in this quarter and number stays around that up or down couple points every quarter, 94% of what you buy is in a privately negotiated bilateral transaction. So, you have to compete with one person in that situation that is yourself, if it gets in your head what your cost of capital is. Our cost of capital is much higher than you guys believe, purely because we believe our normalized earnings is much higher. So, we are not trying to do a cost of capital game on a spot basis. We\u2019re trying to think what a long-term return from our individual stock is for existing owners and trying to make a decision by expanding the partnership, which is buying something, are we increasing the growth rate and terminal value for existing owners who are our investment partners today. That\u2019s how we make capital allocation decisions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Anderson with Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nRichard Anderson: Thanks. It\u2019s a perfect segue to my question. So far this year, you\u2019ve grown the portfolio by 7%, $6 billion to $90 billion of an enterprise value. You\u2019ve grown FFO guidance by 7%. That\u2019s probably coincidence. But I noticed that $0.045 of the $0.13 this quarter was attributable to external investing. So, of that, how much of that was driven by this sort of spread investing phenomenon of a seven yield in your low cost of capital? How much of that was previous year outperforming to your point better growth profile of the company? You did $5.9 billion last year at a 7:1 yield. I imagine that\u2019s a higher yield today. So, is the $0.045 purely from activity this year or outperformance from previous years? Thanks.\nTimothy McHugh: Thanks, Rich. I would just note that $0.045 is capital activity, right? So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re financing things and that\u2019s also what we\u2019re acquiring. And the bucketing is representive of incremental changes in guidance. So, that is all from incremental capital activity since we last provided guidance. The move in our kind of senior housing or outpatient or triple net, that will be like fundamental performance. And so things we acquired last year outperforming underwriting are showing up in kind of fundamentals. Whereas when I get the guide and talk about capital activity, it\u2019s really just incremental from last time we updated you what\u2019s being driven by the new acquisitions, the timing of acquisitions and the way we finance.\nShankh Mitra: It\u2019s an extraordinary question, Rich, because if you think about the activity, which is obviously what we talk about quarter-to-quarter, but what impacts your number is when you close and majority of the closings are obviously happening in Q3 and Q4. So, the impact of that closings, you\u2019re not going to entirely feel this year that you\u2019re going to feel it next year, especially with a focus on growth. We are growth investors. We\u2019re not I\u2019ve seen enough companies have been destroyed by chasing yields. You can be assured that that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing. So A, you have a timing issue of obviously how that flows to the number and B, assuming that we are actually buying what we\u2019re telling you buying, which is growth, your impact on a move forward basis will be higher. So, it\u2019s a really, really good question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.\nWesley Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. Can you answer what segments are driving the occupancy gains? Is it active adult, independent, assisted living and any potential mix headwind on rate next year and potential export benefit?\nShankh Mitra: It\u2019s been across the board given the wellness housing portfolio is extremely highly occupied. You should assume that that\u2019s a drag on growth and majority of the growth that\u2019s flowing through our number overall is coming from assisted living and independent living. Sorry, on the export question, let me finish the call question. And on the export side, go back to and focus on what John said on his prepared remarks. Seems like labor cost is moving in our direction. We have no sense of we can\u2019t give you right now what that may or may not be for next year, but directionally it\u2019s moving in our direction. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Kammert with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJames Kammert: Good morning. Thank you. Looking at the SHOP portfolio, obviously the same store portfolio exhibits a little bit higher occupancy and margin versus the total implying obviously non-same store a little lower. Is there a reasonable expectation on cadence as to how fast the total portfolio sort of catches up the same store, if you will, in terms of occupancy and margins at two to three quarters as you apply your operating platform or that too short, too soon?\nShankh Mitra: Let me take the first part. Maybe Tim, you can provide some guidance on how sort of non-same store flows into same store. But frankly speaking, Jim, we don\u2019t really care about same store, non-same store. All we care about is bottom line FFO growth. But there is no question that the non-same store given its lower occupancy will be growing faster. And that\u2019s a function of remember what I said on last call that we\u2019re buying assets and I think Nikhil mentioned this as well, that are lower than market occupancy, right. We\u2019re buying I think I gave bunch of examples last quarter, but Nikhil is buying assets that are 40%, 50%, 60% occupied, right. That\u2019s a drag to our earnings today, but that gets you to a higher earnings tomorrow and gets you better growth.\nTimothy McHugh: Yes. And to add, Jim, so that portfolio total portfolio is probably the biggest difference is you\u2019ve got deliveries on the development side. So you have preopening cost plus just general network capital drags and anything delivered and we\u2019re in a bit of a heavy period of delivery. So, that causes some change. Generally though, you think about kind of the difference between the same store and the total portfolio, the mix is relatively similar. So over time, you should see those margins converge.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Mueller: Yes, hi. In terms of the tech rollout, can you give us a sense as to what you think the annualized margin improvement could be at the property level based on what you\u2019ve rolled out just so far?\nTimothy McHugh: Mike, we\u2019re not going to get on a call and try to speculate what our margin improvement will be. We will tell you that focusing on what we said before, which is we believe that we\u2019re going to get this platform at a higher level margins than pre-COVID. And that is due to a function of where we think operating platform is taking us, where we think the operating platform initiative will take the occupancy to. It\u2019s just an inappropriate sort of a venue to try to speculate what will happen in the future. But we\u2019re optimistic we\u2019ll get to a better place in the future than it was in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Good quarter, great outlook. In regards to the SHOP portfolio, and again, of late you have been comparing some portfolios from triple net to SHOP. Obviously, it is kind of improving or increasing your overall growth profile of the company as you kind of get more exposure to SHOP. I guess ultimately just kind of given what you\u2019re seeing in regards to demand supply fundamentals and how you expect senior housing to move over time. Should we still be expecting that the SHOP portfolio could be an even bigger percentage of your NOI going forward? Or at a certain point, do you start picking up again? Well, the downside when you do have supply or when fundamentals get softer suggest that maybe the up optimal exposure is some percentage of NOI to SHOP.\nShankh Mitra: Very good question Tayo, I\u2019ll point out to you. Let me ask answer the easiest question you asked which is will SHOP continue to grow as a percent of the overall portfolio? The answer is a resounding yes. As you see that our SHOP portfolio is obviously low occupied, majority of the margin flow through is just starting to come. If you just think through what that means, even if we don\u2019t buy another asset, you\u2019ll get to a much higher place than where you are today. So just think through that from a portfolio composition for where it exists today and obviously you can see that\u2019s what we\u2019re buying mostly. The second question is an even a more important one as we think about long-term portfolio management. I would recommend that you go back and read the letter to future shareholders that I wrote few years ago. It\u2019s on the Investor section of our website where we focused on really on this topic, on what our true belief that is volatility is not risk, right? You\u2019re talking about okay, what happens in a year or two or whatever you might get a downside volatility of owning equity versus debt. That\u2019s why your question is, I\u2019m okay with that. That\u2019s what we have a balance sheet for to adjust for that risk. Just remember, volatility in our opinion is not risk. The probability of losing permanent capital in our opinion is risk. So, you are asking a question that is near and dear to my heart. I wrote a lot about this topic. I think you will get a kick out of reading the end section of the letter just focusing on this topic. Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. This will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Timothy McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our third quarter results, performance of our triple-net investment segment, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update and finally, an update to our full-year 2024 outlook. Welltower reported third quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.73 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $1.11 per diluted share, representing 20.7% year-over-year growth. We also reported year-over-year total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 12.6%. Now, turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage stats reported a quarter in arrears. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12-months ending [6/30/2024] (ph). In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 5.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.09 times, marking a new post-COVID high in coverage. Coverage in this portfolio continues to improve above pre-pandemic levels and greater than expected growth in this portfolio is being driven mainly by improving underlying fundamentals and leases currently on a cash basis. Next, same-store NOI in our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage of 1.74 times. Moving on to capital activity. In July, we issued a $1.035 billion convertible note due in 2029. We intend to use the proceeds for the note to address our 2025 unsecured maturities coming due in the second quarter of next year. We continue to equity finance our investment activity in the quarter, raising $1.2 billion of gross proceeds at an average price of $122 per share. This allowed us to fund $2 billion in net investment activity and end the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash and restricted cash from the balance sheet. Staying with the balance sheet, we ended this quarter with 3.73 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. And, even after completing $1.5 billion incremental net investment activity, we expect to end the year below four times net debt to EBITDA, which would represent over a one turn improvement relative to the end of 2023. This level of deleveraging is being achieved despite deploying a record amount of capital. Our cash flow capitalization of acquisitions and the significant increase in our cash flow generation allowed us to build a powerful asset that will allow us to prudently fund future investments and enhance our go-forward cash flow per share growth. To illustrate the substantial increase in balance capacity, as Shankh mentioned earlier, our annualized revenue exceeded $8.2 billion this quarter. This signifies a $3.2 billion increase compared to the end of 2019, while our net debt has decreased by $2.7 billion during that same period, reflecting a 20% decrease from COVID levels, concurrent with a 60% revenue increase over that same period. It is noteworthy that our current debt stack includes $2.1 billion in convertible notes that are in the money. This deleveraging should be amplified through the embedded upside within our senior housing operating portfolio, further bolstering balance sheet capacity and providing for increased flexibility and optionality. Lastly, as I turn to our updated 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not included any investment activity in our outlook beyond the $6.1 billion to-date that has been closed or publicly announced. Last night, we updated our full-year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to $1.75 to $1.81 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $4.27 to $4.33 per diluted share or $4.30 at the midpoint. Our updated normalized FFO guidance represents a $0.13 per share increase at the midpoint from our previously issued guidance. This increase is composed of $0.06 from an improved NOI outlook in our senior housing operating portfolio, $0.015 from taxes and FX, $0.01 from performance in our triple-net and OM segments and $0.045 from accretive capital activity. Underlying this increased FFO per share guidance is an increase in estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth to 11.5% to 13%, driven by sub-segment growth of outpatient medical 2% to 3% long-term post-acute 2% to 3% senior housing triple-net 4% to 5% and finally, increased senior housing operating growth of 22% to 24%. This is driven by the following midpoints in their respective ranges: revenue growth of 9.2%, made up of RevPOR growth of 5.25% and year-over-year occupancy growth of 300 basis points and expense growth of 5%. And with that, we'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Thanks, Jonathan. So, you're right in highlighting that the way that, that kind of RevPOR, ExpPOR math is expressed through our financials is in that flow through margin. So last quarter, we noted that flow through margins had gone above 60% for the first time since the kind of post-COVID recovery. Again, this quarter, we were in the low-60s from a flow through. Important to note in that, that we had one operator making about 1% of our same-store pool that through some kind of changes to their operating model they're implementing and higher expenses right now than we'd expect. So, ex that operator, flow through margins would have been closer to 67%. So, consistent with what we've said in the past, you should see flow through margins kind of move into the mid-60s and approach 70% as we start to re-approach kind of pre-COVID levels of occupancy of 88% and then from thereon improve. Yes, Mike. The goal is clearly the latter part of your question, so significantly better financial results. How I would describe kind of the flow of the cost is you're right. The initial investment is coming through Welltower. There's a bit of duplicative cost upfront because as we kind of transition into this, you have a legacy technology systems of operators moving over to our own. In the end, this isn't intended to be a cost savings exercise, but it will be the tech stack will be less expensive because it will be scaled across our entire operating platform rather than subscale across all of our operators. And that'll come through over time. But beyond the investment, the initial thought should be there shouldn't be an uptick in costs. Thanks, Rich. I would just note that $0.045 is capital activity, right? So, that's how we're financing things and that's also what we're acquiring. And the bucketing is representive of incremental changes in guidance. So, that is all from incremental capital activity since we last provided guidance. The move in our kind of senior housing or outpatient or triple net, that will be like fundamental performance. And so things we acquired last year outperforming underwriting are showing up in kind of fundamentals. Whereas when I get the guide and talk about capital activity, it's really just incremental from last time we updated you what's being driven by the new acquisitions, the timing of acquisitions and the way we finance.

            "name": "Nikhil Chaudhri",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that our investment activity and pipeline remain incredibly robust, visible and actionable. Over the past three months since our last call, we have either acquired or entered into agreements to acquire an additional $1.2 billion of assets. This is a fraction of the $15 billion plus of opportunities that we consider during this time frame. These incremental transactions bring our year-to-date investment activity to a record setting $6.1 billion. This growth underscores the strength of our market position and the abundance of opportunities we're pursuing. As always, our focus and excitement are driven by the expected attractive risk adjusted returns of our transaction activity rather than the deal volume. Acquiring quality assets at a reasonable basis with significant cash flow growth prospects remain at the core of our investment strategy. In the third quarter, we closed on $2.15 billion of transactions. Our activity remains granular with Q3 closings spanning 15 different transactions across 13 different operating partners and a medium transaction size of $56 million. Our Q3 transactions were heavily focused on our seniors and wellness housing businesses, where we added 40 properties and more than 5,200 units. We acquired these assets, which have an average age of just over five years, at $244,000 per unit at a significant discount for replacement cost. We expect our transactions that close this quarter to stabilize in the mid-to-high 7s yield and generate an unlevered IRR in excess of 10%. Our team's reputation, expertise and network continue to drive our success. An impressive 94% of our investment volume by dollars this quarter was acquired through off market transactions. This approach has allowed us to source opportunities from a diverse range of sellers, including six transactions from developers facing maturing construction loans, three from foreign counterparties, including two from Asia and one from Central or from Continental Europe, four transactions with repeat counterparties, highlighting our reputation as a fair and reliable partner. I'd like to quickly reflect on the macroeconomic trends we have witnessed recently. Despite the 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed, the 10 year treasury yield has increased by over 60 basis points since the announced cut as market participants are now wrestling with the likelihood of long rates staying higher for longer. We laid the case out for this scenario in detail on our last call. The impact of the rate cut to borrowers with floating rate debt is de minimis as they still face debt maturity challenges as bank lenders continue to reduce their senior housing exposure. 3Q earnings results for many banks that have historically been active in the senior space focused on highlighting their desire to continue to reduce their exposure to our sector. Agency financing also remained challenging due to limited stable product and elevated DSCR requirements and higher long-term rates. It's not surprising that with this backdrop, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's origination volumes are down 91% and 71%, respectively, versus their pre-pandemic peaks. This constrained lending environment continues to create attractive investment opportunities for us. On the back of this environment, we are engaged in direct bilateral conversations with eight of our highly respective private peers to evaluate significant portions of their portfolios for potential acquisitions. We are also seeing an increase in interest from sellers requesting to take Welltower OP units in transaction consideration in lieu of cash. This allows those exiting their asset level positions to have a mechanism for continuing to participate in the strong tailwinds of our industry, but in a manner not constrained by an unforgiving capital structure and with our best-in-business operating partners backed by Welltower's operating platform. This proactive and collaborative approach underscores our commitment to continuing to unlock interesting opportunities while conducting business in a first class and mutually beneficial manner. In conclusion, in this volatile capital markets environment, we remain focused on leveraging our expertise and data science platform with our operating partners and peer relationships to capitalize on attractive opportunities to create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our team. I'll now hand the call over to Tim, to walk through our financial results. Yes. Juan, as you would imagine, right, when you're talking to eight different groups, from some of those, you might not look to buy any assets either you don't like the asset quality or the valuation. And with some, you might see eye to eye on a lot. Right? So, it's hard to generalize, but just given the numbers we're talking about, the different range of outcomes that everyone we're speaking with."

            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Shankh, and good morning, everyone. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, we posted another quarter of fantastic results with no let up and momentum, which continues to build across the business. Before getting into the details, I'll echo Shankh's sentiment that we're looking forward to closing out the year on a strong note and excited for another period of solid growth in 2025 and beyond. During the quarter, total portfolio same-store NOI increased 12.6% versus the year ago period, once again led by our senior housing operating portfolio. First, I'll provide an update on our Outpatient Medical business, which posted year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 2.2%. The consistency of the business remains evident with healthy leasing activity during the period and another quarter of strong tenant retention. Same-store occupancy remained stable at an industry leading 94.5%. As for the Senior Housing business, the business continues to deliver exceptional results. Demand for needs-based product is clearly on the rise and our proactive asset management initiatives, which I'll get into shortly, are unquestionably delivering Alpha. In the third quarter, portfolio achieved year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 23%, once again exceeding our expectations and allowing us to yet again raise our full-year outlook, which Tim will describe shortly. The strength in our Senior Housing business was broad-based with solid occupancy gains experienced across all our geographies and property types. It's worth repeating that while the summer months typically represent the most active period of leasing during the year, our sequential same-store occupancy gain of 120 basis points and spot-to-spot gain of 160 basis points are well above typical seasonal trends. In fact, this quarter tied a record for sequential same-store occupancy growth when excluding the second half of 2021 as we were coming out of the building. On a year-over-year basis, same-store occupancy increased 310 basis points, also amongst the highest levels ever achieved in our history. Rate growth across the portfolio also remained strong with same-store RevPOR growth increasing 4.9% year-over-year. While our budgeting process for next year is just starting, we believe that rate growth should once again remain favorable as portfolio vacancies decline further and our pricing initiatives begin to bear fruit, more to come in the coming months. In terms of expenses, we continue to be encouraged by trends within the labor market and further moderation of broader inflationary pressures. ExpPOR or expense per occupied room increased just 0.7% year-over-year, second lowest level in our history. Most importantly though, as Shankh mentioned, the spread between RevPOR and ExpPOR growth remains historically wide, contributing to another quarter of substantial operating margin expansion, at 26.5%, the NOI margin for our same-store portfolio remains below pre-COVID levels, but we expect continued improvement going forward as the operating leverage inherent in the business is recognized. The other big driver of future margin expansion will be our operating platform. Our operating platform includes a technology platform and other site level technology, an internal capital team, which I referenced last quarter, our data science capabilities and more. I continue to recruit top talent and build out various capabilities that we leverage with our operators and our asset management team across our portfolio to deliver Alpha. During our last call, I mentioned that we would soon be going live with our first technology platform in Q3, launching an end-to-end tech platform with our first operator. I'm pleased to report that through the dedicated efforts of the Welltower team and our operator, it has been very successful for all stakeholders. The customer experience is a modern digital experience, substantially simplifying and shortening the move-in process for the family and the residents by eliminating paperwork. The employee experience has improved dramatically as we have simplified and or automated the processes as well as providing employees with important real-time data ensuring top care for our customers. As a result of the technology platform, the Executive Directors are saving five hours per move-in and enabling them more time for leadership and to focus on our customers. Additionally, potential errors are being avoided due to the singular database for the various modules, meaning that data is only input once, so there are no inconsistencies in the spelling of a customer's name or other critical care information. And finally, we deliver the technology platform at a lower cost than the combined disparate systems being replaced. At this point, we're preparing to roll out the tech platform to additional operators in the near-term. While we have a long way to go, we're excited by our initial success, which would not have been possible without the hard work and buy in from our best-in-class operating partners and the many Welltower team members who are working tirelessly on this effort. To sum it up, it was another strong quarter for Welltower between solid operating performance and our accomplishments on various operations and asset management initiatives. While it's too early to speak to the outlook for 2025 with any detail, we remain as optimistic as ever on the growth prospects of our business as the demand supply backdrop for senior housing is only strengthening and the benefits of the operating platform begin to be realized in a more meaningful way. We continue to execute on our mission to improve the experience of senior housing residents and employees. With that, I'll turn it over to Nikhil. Yes, I'll jump in. Traffic is up, addition with what we saw is higher closing ratios. In other words, our execution is improving, which is important and it's a function of the operating platform there. As it relates to turnover, that's been consistent, no issues there. But the bigger issue is we're executing and taking market share. [George] (ph), on the second question, in my prepared remarks, I talked about how of the $1.2 billion of incremental activity we announced this quarter, the universe of opportunities we looked at was $15 billion. So, from the $15 billion we acquired $1.2 billion. This number fluctuates up or down every quarter depending on what we look at. But generally speaking, it's roughly a 10% hit rate. And then your second question about geographically, I think Shankh said it in his remarks, but we've got active transactions we're looking at in all three months. Yes. So, I'll step in. John, the question is let me give you a broader answer here. So, as I mentioned last time, we've created an internal team. We're executing at amazing levels where we're both reducing the cost by 20% to 50% on, say, a unit basis and speeding up the time lines. We're also changing the fundamental way we do things. Historically, this business is really the operators function kind of like on the PE model where it's very short time decisions. So, for example, you might have an asset that has three buildings and they'll do one roof. And then the next year following roof and the following year following roof. What that's doing is driving up costs dramatically because of smaller projects, because of three mobilizations. And then you have all kinds of other stuff flowing through like the roof leaks impacting the customer experience and all the issues along those lines. So, what's happening right now is we're doing things correctly with the long-term life cycle costs in mind, lowering the long-term run rate. So that means we're pulling some things forward and it won't change it will lower the long term run rate. But right now, there's some stuff that's elevated because in that example, we'd be doing all three roofs, avoiding the future roof leaks and getting the project behind us and moving forward. So, there's a little noise that's going on right now, but it's all for the efforts to lower the long-term run rate and the unit costs are dramatically lower. So, it's just absolute great execution by the team."

            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. I'll review third quarter business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John, will provide an update on operational performance for our senior housing and medical office portfolios. Nikhil will give you an update on the investment landscape, and Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and guidance updates. I'm once again pleased to report another very strong quarter across the board at Welltower from operations to capital deployment, a further strengthening of our balance sheet, continued progress on our operating platform rollout. The result was a 21% increase in FFO per share and our fourth guidance raised for the year, this time by $0.13 per share, reflecting the extraordinary strength of our platform. This quarter also marks the first time in our company's history in which our quarterly revenue exceeded $2 billion. In terms of the senior housing operating portfolio, results continue to surpass our already high expectations. Year-over-year same-store NOI growth came in at 23%, eight consecutive quarters in which the growth exceeded 20%. And, despite macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened geopolitical tensions, topline growth on a same-store basis remain resilient at 9% driven by another quarter of outsized occupancy growth of 310 basis points coupled with strong rate growth. Particularly noteworthy is the 160 basis points of sequential spot-to-spot occupancy growth that we experienced, a reflection of both strong tailwinds of our business and especially our operating platform initiative, which will continue to bear fruit in the coming quarters and years. Not only we're pleased with the sequential growth, but the occupancy run rate exiting the quarter solidly exceeded the prior year and early fourth quarter results have been positive as well. Additionally, I would be remiss not to mention that the spread between RevPOR or unit revenue and ExpPOR or unit expense remains at historically wide level. This trend resulted in another 300 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion of our SHO portfolio. As we have discussed in the past, we remain focused on the delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR, not the absolute levels. Overall, we are delighted with our results and believe that we're carrying significant momentum into 2025 as tailwinds which we have lifted our business over the past couple of years continue to strengthen. As I have described in our recent calls, the backdrop of our senior housing business is only getting better as growth of 80 plus population picks up from here. Starting next year, 5,000 Americans will turn 80 every day. And remember, that we're only at the front end of this trend with the crest of the silver tsunami not being seen until well into the future. And, what is also irrefutable is the favorable supply outlook. Construction starts continue to drop and in the third quarter reached the second lowest level on record after the second quarter of 2009. Banks continue to wind down their senior housing loan exposure and have been reluctant to put new capital to work. And, given the extended timeline to build a new senior living community in our market, which we detailed on Slide 19 of our business update, we may not face the impact of new supply in our markets for years. Frankly, in today's construction cost and financing cost environment, it makes no economic sense to build. We have had couple of years of solid growth, but we believe that we are still in the very early stages of an extended period of extraordinary growth for the senior housing sector. And, without stealing John's thunder, this end market demand growth will be amplified by the rollout of our operating platform. I'm delighted to report that during the quarter we went live with our tech platform at our first set of properties along with preparing to broaden and accelerate the rollout in the near-term. Beyond the technology rollout, we expect our broader operating platform initiatives including our hands on asset management to have a compounding effect on our portfolio's outperformance. Shifting to capital deployment, the only change we have observed since our last call is that the opportunity set has expanded farther. We announced another $1.2 billion of transaction completed or under contract since our last quarterly update, bringing our total year-to-date investment activity to over $6 billion. Nikhil will provide you more details, but as with the past few quarters, most of our investments have been bolt-on acquisitions within senior housing sector improving and benefiting from our already established regional density. Our goal remains to go deep in our markets, not broad. While 2024 is shaping out to be a record year for Welltower in terms of capital deployment, we continue to unearth compelling opportunities across all property types, geographies and capital structure and expect a busy Q4 and Q1. Lastly, I will quickly reiterate that through the exceptional cash flow growth we have achieved this year and prudent funding of our investment activity, our balance sheet has strengthened meaningfully. With leverage at 3.7 times and nearly $10 billion of liquidity, we remain well-positioned to address all near-term obligations and capitalize attractive investment opportunities. And, as we have created flexibility to lean in to the balance sheet to drive further growth at opportune time. To sum it up, we're starting to see the Lollapalooza effect of cyclical, secular and structural growth driven by our operating platform, which will be further enhanced by bolt-on acquisitions and balance sheet optimization to drive meaningful partial growth. We are singularly focused on this long-term compounding of our partial earnings growth for existing owners, our true North Star. We cannot be distracted, discouraged or dissuaded. With that, I will turn the call over to, John. Thank you, Tim. As many of you, my fellow shareholders know that my team and I are true believers that compounding is the only way to create substantial long-term value. Compounding not just in the context of middle school math, but in everything in life. We define compounding as dogged, incremental and continuous progress over a very long period of time. And for this team, it has been close to a decade since we took our predecessor company down to a start by turning over roughly 60% of the portfolio, changing out 95% of our human capital in middle management and up, evolving our operating partners while creating greater alignment through win-win structures and so on. More importantly, we change these companies culture as we build what you know as Welltower today, brick-by-brick. We founded a culture of owners not managers with agency problems, a culture or shared value with our operating partners to deliver real value for our customers and site level employees shoulder-to-shoulder no matter what. A culture of resilience having endured four different crisis over last past decade, crisis included oversupply, a crippling pandemic, labor shortage and the worst inflation in 40 years. A culture of extreme excellence to build and create true residual Alpha for our owners not defined by Wall Street's view of real estate industry which has a checkered history of creating value. We're focused on creating Alpha, not levered beta for existing owners. Over the past decade, we have built a unique data science platform, the first of its kind in real estate industry, powered initially by machine learning, then deep learning and finally by AI well before many of these terms got into the folklore. And finally, with Chutzpah and perhaps Nai\u0308vete\u0301, we launched an operating platform initiative by attracting John and hundreds of our new colleagues who followed him from a dozen industries of higher standards during a pandemic no less when we didn't even know if the business would survive. I sat down this past weekend to reflect on our Q3 results and for the first time since I arrived at Welltower, I felt a sense of satisfaction in that the compounding of our efforts over the course of many years is beginning to pay off. Not because of the strong results we posted in the quarter, but because of a feeling that our audacious dream of transforming this industry is finally coming together and what that may potent for next few years. Having said that, this feeling lasted for about five minutes as my usual healthy paranoia set in. We have a long journey ahead and frankly that our pursuit of dogged incremental and continuous progress will never be over. Mediocrity and complacency have no place in our culture. Like Navy SEALs, we believe the only easy day was yesterday. Where occasionally in moments like this, looking at the scoreboard may not be so bad, we're in this game because of our love for the game. And with that, we'll be back to the game. Operator, please open the call up for questions. Nick, really good question. It's hard to say in a general matter because cost is a function of local situations, labor etcetera. We haven't seen construction costs come down. You have seen some material costs have come down which has been surpassed obviously taken up more by insurance and labor costs. So, if you just want to sort of have a general rule of thumb, remember rent growth will not get you there. Rent growth relative to labor cost, operating labor cost growth will get you there, right. So, you need in markets 25%, 30% increase of RevPOR minus ExpPOR where construction will start to make sense. I always believe people will do what make economic sense and we have tried to make it work in the best location where pricing is not a question, even we're struggling with that. That's the best locations such as Palm Beach and Cupertino's of the world. Imagine your question is that average of the industry where this makes no economic sense whatsoever. Ron, very good question. We're not going to sit here and try to speculate what 2025 will look like. I'm going to point out a couple of things. John made a specific comment in his prepared remarks about how he's feeling about pricing. We'll see what the market gives us. I will tell you that we would get we would have market share increase. So, we'll but at the end of the day, everybody is subject to market. We are focused on RevPOR minus ExpPOR, not RevPOR. Having said that, you can focus on what John said in his prepared remarks. I will remind you from an occupancy standpoint, remember revenue is a function of pricing and occupancy. I'm going to refocus you what I've said on the last call. And I said occupancy can not necessarily saying it will, but can get growth, can get better next year. And hopefully after this record sequential occupancy change in third quarter of this year that gives you probably gives more credence to the comment I made. I'm willing to sit about that much. Hopefully that's helpful, but just understand it's too early to say. We'll see what market gives us. Yes. Austin, I'm not going to comment on what may or may not happen in the macro. Absorption is a macro industry-wide phenomena. As John just mentioned that we're focused on market share. You can see what our sequential occupancy growth is relative to the industry, that you will see that we're entirely focused on using our operating platform and our best-in-class operators hard work to get market share, right. If we can get improvement in absorption, that'll be a gravy. That's just not something we can control. That's not something we're focused on. Mike, just remember one of the things we have to think through, just in addition to what Tim said that software cost is already part of the SHOP margins, right? So, there is cost flowing through our P&L and it's duplicative in nature today because obviously you have to make a lot of initial or upfront cost. But just as a run rate cost, remember that technology cost is part of the SHOP expense stack. Yes. Josh, it's a good catch that if you just look at the page of what we're trying to give you a sense of what occupancy growth, how that impacts obviously our NOI embedded NOI growth. Going back to pre-COVID, I've said this before, if we only go back to pre-COVID, at least John and I are stepping down. We consider that as a complete failure. So, we expect that occupancy growth occupancy will go substantially higher than where the pre-COVID is. However, the most important point is what you made is at today's rate. Remember what should be added if we're just trying to understand what's a normalized earnings for this company, what you should add, not just whatever you think is the frictional vacancy of our portfolio should be, that's obviously one add. You have to decide how long it takes there to get obviously get to that frictional vacancy. And meanwhile in those years, what's your RevPOR minus ExpPOR, because our rates are growing faster than our expense growth, right? That adds to that. And just also point out that we will see that our first set of numbers we gave you few years ago when we started giving you the disclosure, that pool of assets, our NOI is actually $33 million higher than pre-COVID. Occupancy is significantly lower, yet it is $33 million higher. You'll see that in I believe the fourth bar on that page and that's because rates are much higher, right? So, you have RevPOR minus ExpPOR got you to that higher NOI despite lower occupancy and that same thing follows through as you are thinking about whatever to whatever your definition of frictional vacancy is. And that's how you sort of get to the number. We're not going to sit here and try to quantify what technology costs may or may not come down. That's not the focus. We think we're after the big ball, which is revenue. There is a lot of opportunity on the expense side, as we implement systems and processes and have site level employees focus on why to what they have signed up to do, which is providing care. That's a compassionate care is why they have signed up to be in this industry. So, we want to try to make people's life easier. As John pointed out, just one example, our tech suite rollout, it's saving about five hours of effort, far moving from an executive director's perspective, right? So, that she can focus on what she signed up to do, which is leading people and providing care to families, right? Care to residents and focusing on the resident and their families. So, you think about it, this is not just a question of cost. When we talk about margins, I don't want you to think about cost. I want you to think about how we improve overall resident and employee experience and what that means for residents' willingness and ability to pay. Thank you very much for the question. Let me start and Nikhil you jump in. First, we're not trying to maintain the level of activity. I have said this before, our company is not designed to buy stuff. We're not a bunch of deal junkies. We're trying to invest capital to further strengthening our market position and drive partial earnings and cash flow growth. So, if the market opportunity is there, we'll do it. If the market opportunity is not there, we'll not do it. If we believe the market prices have gone to a level where somebody is willing to pay more for assets than what we are willing to pay for, we'll sell like you have seen pre-COVID we have sell $15 billion of assets. The focus is on value creation on a partial basis for existing shareholders. Having said that, if you have 94% for example in this quarter and number stays around that up or down couple points every quarter, 94% of what you buy is in a privately negotiated bilateral transaction. So, you have to compete with one person in that situation that is yourself, if it gets in your head what your cost of capital is. Our cost of capital is much higher than you guys believe, purely because we believe our normalized earnings is much higher. So, we are not trying to do a cost of capital game on a spot basis. We're trying to think what a long-term return from our individual stock is for existing owners and trying to make a decision by expanding the partnership, which is buying something, are we increasing the growth rate and terminal value for existing owners who are our investment partners today. That's how we make capital allocation decisions. It's an extraordinary question, Rich, because if you think about the activity, which is obviously what we talk about quarter-to-quarter, but what impacts your number is when you close and majority of the closings are obviously happening in Q3 and Q4. So, the impact of that closings, you're not going to entirely feel this year that you're going to feel it next year, especially with a focus on growth. We are growth investors. We're not I've seen enough companies have been destroyed by chasing yields. You can be assured that that's not what we're doing. So A, you have a timing issue of obviously how that flows to the number and B, assuming that we are actually buying what we're telling you buying, which is growth, your impact on a move forward basis will be higher. So, it's a really, really good question. It's been across the board given the wellness housing portfolio is extremely highly occupied. You should assume that that's a drag on growth and majority of the growth that's flowing through our number overall is coming from assisted living and independent living. Sorry, on the export question, let me finish the call question. And on the export side, go back to and focus on what John said on his prepared remarks. Seems like labor cost is moving in our direction. We have no sense of we can't give you right now what that may or may not be for next year, but directionally it's moving in our direction. Thank you. Let me take the first part. Maybe Tim, you can provide some guidance on how sort of non-same store flows into same store. But frankly speaking, Jim, we don't really care about same store, non-same store. All we care about is bottom line FFO growth. But there is no question that the non-same store given its lower occupancy will be growing faster. And that's a function of remember what I said on last call that we're buying assets and I think Nikhil mentioned this as well, that are lower than market occupancy, right. We're buying I think I gave bunch of examples last quarter, but Nikhil is buying assets that are 40%, 50%, 60% occupied, right. That's a drag to our earnings today, but that gets you to a higher earnings tomorrow and gets you better growth. Very good question Tayo, I'll point out to you. Let me ask answer the easiest question you asked which is will SHOP continue to grow as a percent of the overall portfolio? The answer is a resounding yes. As you see that our SHOP portfolio is obviously low occupied, majority of the margin flow through is just starting to come. If you just think through what that means, even if we don't buy another asset, you'll get to a much higher place than where you are today. So just think through that from a portfolio composition for where it exists today and obviously you can see that's what we're buying mostly. The second question is an even a more important one as we think about long-term portfolio management. I would recommend that you go back and read the letter to future shareholders that I wrote few years ago. It's on the Investor section of our website where we focused on really on this topic, on what our true belief that is volatility is not risk, right? You're talking about okay, what happens in a year or two or whatever you might get a downside volatility of owning equity versus debt. That's why your question is, I'm okay with that. That's what we have a balance sheet for to adjust for that risk. Just remember, volatility in our opinion is not risk. The probability of losing permanent capital in our opinion is risk. So, you are asking a question that is near and dear to my heart. I wrote a lot about this topic. I think you will get a kick out of reading the end section of the letter just focusing on this topic. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Kayla and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. You may begin.\nMatthew McQueen: Thank you and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on a reasonable assumption, the company can give no assurances that the projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I will review first quarter business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on operational performance for our Senior Housing and Medical office portfolios. Nikhil will give you an update on investment landscape and Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and guidance updates. We're very pleased to report another quarter of significant bottom line growth with normalized FFO per share up 17% year-over-year or over 19% adjusted for prior year subsidies. Quarter was once again led by our Senior Housing portfolio, but with notable contributions from all other areas of the business, including investments. Last night we announced another $1 billion of acquisitions under contract since our last update at NEREIT Conference in June, bringing our acquisition activity to approximately $5 billion year-to-date. There continues to be no dearth of capital deployment opportunities in front of us at extraordinarily attractive economics, which I'll get into shortly. Ultimately, we're pleased to once again be able to raise our full year FFO per share guidance as we continue to capitalize on the unprecedented internal and external growth opportunity in Senior Housing. Before John goes into details, I wanted to first provide some high-level thoughts on the Senior Housing business and why we remain as optimistic as ever about its future prospects.\nRevPOR:\nRevPOR: While margin remains well below pre-COVID levels, I would note that we have made significant progress since hitting the trough levels of profitability in 2021, with farther upside remaining through the scaling benefits achieved through higher occupancy aka operating leverage and as the operating platform begins to bear fruit. Overall, while we are pleased with the results we achieved this quarter, what we are much more excited about is the fundamental backdrop is for us to dramatically improve as we look forward to 25 and beyond. It starts with end market demand. Baby boomers are just entering their eighties and pickup in demand, which we have recently witnessed, will only intensify going forward. Not only is the 80 plus population growing at a fastest clip in decades, but what's even more compelling is the growth of this group of seniors will accelerate to 5% to 7% per annum as we close out the decade, driving demand even higher and there is plummeting new supply. The second quarter construction starts were once again negligible, falling well below trough levels you've seen even during GFC. It remains extraordinarily challenging to secure construction financing as regional banks that served as the most prolific lender to the sector in previous cycles has effectively shut down all activity. And despite the attractive growth prospect of our industry, most developers have thrown in the towel due to a lack of development economics. We think this will continue as returns, or should I say lack thereof, were made on other people's money, no longer available as investors lick their wounds from the last cycle. While the beta of the Senior Housing business remains extraordinarily attractive, what truly sets us apart are our efforts to generate outsized alpha for our existing owners. This is reflected by the difficult but important steps that we continue to take to further amplify our long-term growth trajectory. This not only includes the build out of our operating platform, which John will get into in a minute, but also involves numerous capital light transactions such as operator transitions, conversion and conversion of triple-net and to RIDEA leased structures. We are confident that several operating platform initiatives will start to impact occupancy and NOI next year. Expanding on the theme of enhancing long-term growth through capitalized transactions, we announced transition of 89 Holiday by Atria assets to six Welltower's strongest operating partners with deep expertise and local scale in their regions. We have experienced tremendous success with hundreds of transition we have effectuated in recent years and we expect similar outcomes from this most recent set of assets. More importantly, we hope to achieve over $70 million of additional NOI upside when new operators stabilize these properties. And separately, we converted or agreed to convert 47 triple-net leased properties to RIDEA structure in Q2, allowing us to directly participate in substantial growth of these properties that are poised to deliver in coming years.\nStoryPoint: To illustrate that in new investment terms, you need $2 billion of new acquisitions to achieve that level of NOI accretion, assuming 2% long-term accretion of our investment model. That's how impactful the math is for our near to medium term growth and clearly our owners will capture all the upside from stabilization of this asset, which should enhance our long-term earnings growth trajectory as well. Turning to investment activity, last night we announced additional investment activity that brings us to nearly $5 billion of transactions closed or under contract to close year-to-date. The U.S. and UK comprised of the bulk of our recent transaction with virtually all transaction being completed in Senior Housing space. Our investment teams remain busy as ever as the opportunity to acquire senior housing assets continue to expand, largely from resulting of the broken capital structure and other debt driven situations that Nikhil described on last call. Notably, while 2023 was a record year for us with $5 billion of investment, we have achieved this level of transaction activity in just first seven months of 2024. Our pipeline beyond these transactions remain robust, visible, granular and actionable.\nS&P: And yesterday, we announced the recast and upsize of our revolving credit facility to $5 billion, bringing near-term liquidity to nearly $9 billion. Our new revolver comes at an improved pricing and extended term relative to our previous facility, a testament to the strengthening of our credit profile and growth outlook of our business even in these challenging times for real estate credit. We will remain disciplined in our funding of our future opportunities. But as I have previously mentioned, we have created significant debt capacity to tap into creating another lever for us to further augment our earnings growth. With that, I'll pass it over to John.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you and good morning. As Shankh mentioned, we reported another strong quarter with total same-store NOI growth, once again achieving double-digit levels led by our Senior Housing operating portfolio, which I'll provide more details on momentarily, but I'll first touch on our Outpatient Medical business. We reported 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth, which is in line with our expectations. Leasing velocity remains healthy, our retention rate remains strong at 93%, and our industry leading occupancy continues to be stable at 94.3%. Turning to Senior Housing, we continue to be pleased with the level of same-store NOI growth being generated by this business, which once again exceeded our expectations at 21.7%. Attaining 20% plus NOI growth for any sector is an incredible achievement, but seven consecutive quarters is truly exceptional. I'd also note that the strength of our business remains broad based, with all regions and property types posting outsized levels of growth. And as Shankh described, our confidence in generating elevated levels of growth in future years continues to grow given the extraordinarily demand-supply backdrop ahead of us and our focus on improving the operating business. In terms of same-store revenue in the quarter, we posted 8.6% growth compared to the prior year's period, with contributions from both occupancy and rate. Same-store occupancy increased 280 basis points, the highest level of year-over-year growth we've achieved in the second quarter of any year outside of 2022, when we were coming out of COVID. RevPOR growth remains healthy at 5.3% and ExpPOR increased just 1%. On the expense side, we're witnessing a couple of different factors at play. First, we continued to see a reversal of the broader inflationary pressures which impacted the business in recent years and second, we're benefiting from the operating leverage inherent in the business as we experience slowing incremental cost as occupancy increases. Another reflection of this trend is growth in comp core [ph] for compensation for occupied room, which rose just 0.9% year-over-year, well below our historical average due to the operational scaling benefits we're beginning to witness. Overall, as Shankh mentioned, our focus remains on driving the delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR substantially higher as part of our platform initiatives. To give a real time example, over the last few months, we've gone through an extensive review of different care levels across our assisted living portfolio in an effort to create greater simplification for residents and their families. As a result of this exercise, we also made the strategic decision to focus our leasing efforts on lower acuity assisted living residents across many of our communities. While a lower acuity resident pays less than a higher acuity resident for the same room, they also consume far less human resources and tend to stay longer. This creates a healthier rent roll over a longer period of time, leading to higher NOI. We are pleased to report that these initiatives are paying off as we've been able to attract a substantially lower number of lower acuity AL residents during the summer leasing season. I'm proud of what our team has been able to pull off in close coordination with our operating partners. Beyond that, we continue to make important strides in our efforts to optimize our portfolio and improve the resident and employee experience to the build out of the platform. We're going live with properties in Q3 and anticipate rolling out the end-to-end tech platform to the first operator in the near-term. The excitement of the community and corporate team is palpable as we truly streamline the business, integrating and digitizing the flow of information from the website through the CRM, the ERP and the care module, as well as other modules. Our communities will be able to eliminate most paperwork and materially reduce administrative time and simplify many processes, including the onerous move in process. Our objective of leveraging technology to improve the overall resident experience and enabling employees to focus more of their time on residents is being realized. We continue to achieve success in other initiatives, including the creation of the Cap team at Welltower, which enables Welltower to directly execute capital, renovation and facility projects on our sites in partnership with our operators. The result is that we are dramatically driving down costs 20% to 50% while improving the execution and improving the customer value proposition positioning Welltower's assets to drive compounding earnings growth for many years. Since the start of the year, we have completed or are working on about 2000 separate projects with 17 different operators at over 150 sites in three countries. As a result of the success of the teams, Welltower and our operators, we have expanded our work more than originally planned, which includes thousands of units taken offline. This important initiative will result in some near-term disruption, but has the potential to meaningfully contribute to our growth in 2025 and beyond. This tremendous amount of work requires the highest level of collaboration ever attempted and accomplished at Welltower between our operating partners, our vendors and our corporate employees. I am grateful for the support and teamwork by all involved people and most certainly the leaders of our operators who are standing side-by-side with me as we re-envision this business focused on improving both resident and employee experience. In conclusion, another great quarter, great demand-supply dynamics, technology platform is launching, the Cap team is executing and many other earnings drivers are in place to enable years of compounding earnings growth. Thank you and I'll turn the call over to Nikhil.\nNikhil Chaudhri: Thanks John. It's hard to believe that we're almost at the end of the summer. We have worked tirelessly over the last three months since our first quarter call, expanding on our investment activity by an additional 2.1 billion. Since we have been working at such a torrid pace, I thought it would be helpful to summarize what we have accomplished so far this year. We closed on $200 million of transactions in the first quarter and announced additional transaction activity of 2.6 billion on our first quarter call. We subsequently signed up and announced another $1 billion of transactions at NAREIT in June and last night announced an incremental $1.1 billion of acquisitions, bringing this year's total closed or under contract transactions to $4.9 billion. We are pleased to report that as of the end of the second quarter, we have closed on $1.6 billion of these transactions and we are diligently working towards closing the remainder of our announced transaction activity by year-end. The incremental $2.1 billion of investment activity announced since our first quarter call is essentially entirely made up of seniors and wellness housing assets in the U.S. and UK and spans a total of 17 transactions with a median transaction size of $65 million. These transactions comprise of 82 communities with nearly 7000 units, an average age of seven years and a stabilized yield above 8%. Through these transactions, we are growing our relationships with Legend, Storypoint, QSL, Care UK, Arrow Senior Living, to name a few operators. Welltower's stellar reputation permeates globally as we remain the counterparty of choice for sellers, as evidenced by the unabated quality and pace of our investment activity. I want to highlight an emerging new trend that we have witnessed recently, inbound inquiries from Asian and continental European investors who own seniors housing product in our target markets. Perhaps driven by the strength of the dollar, but we are seeing direct inquiries to acquire senior housing assets from foreign counterparties who we have not transacted with before. During this quarter, we had net loan funding of $349 million as we originated $486 million of new loans and received repayments of $137 million across 17 loans. A vast majority of the new lending activity was with one high quality sponsor from whom we also acquired a portfolio of seniors housing assets. As I have stated before, we are creative deal makers with a problem solving mindset. I spoke last quarter about the dearth of debt capital in the Seniors Housing space, and I'm pleased to announce that we have been able to close out a creative win-win transaction with a counterparty given that backdrop. We previously transacted with this counterparty last year when we acquired 10 Seniors Housing assets for $469 million. We reengaged with them this year for a follow-on transaction. In this case, for a subset of the portfolio spanning roughly 1000 units we were able to see eye-to-eye on upfront pricing of $271 million and acquired those assets outright at a greater than 35% discount or replacement cost assuming a maximum payout on the performance based earn-out. For another subset of assets, we couldn't find alignment on the current valuation, but we were able to offer a creative debt solution. This $456 million first mortgage loan carries a 10% yield and spans nearly 1000 units across several newly built marquee senior housing properties with the last dollar basis at approximately half of replacement cost of these light new assets, this loan reflects a 56% loan to value based on our underwritten stabilized values. As with most of our loans, there are several structural enhancements to potentially convert these shorter duration debt investments into long duration equity investments. This entire transaction is underwritten to achieve an unlevered IRR north of 10%. Moving on to capital light transactions, as announced earlier, we are transitioning 89 former Holiday assets from Atria to six different regional managers. 69 of these transitions are already complete, and the remaining 20 are scheduled for later this week. As was our business plan all along, we have plans for significant capital investment across all these buildings. 65% of these projects are either completed or underway, with the remaining working through plans, scopes and budgets to start soon. With an inventory of over 900 modernized light new units, the newly appointed regional managers are hard at work in training the sales teams to market the enhanced value proposition of these communities. While we have been disappointed with the results achieved to date, we remain optimistic that we'll soon recognize significant operational upside in this portfolio through our focused regional density strategy.\nSagora:\nBryan: I'll now hand the call over to Tim to walk through our financial results.\nSagora: I'll now hand the call over to Tim to walk through our financial results.\nTimothy McHugh: Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, performance of our triple-net investment segments, our capital activity, our balance sheet liquidity update and finally an update to our full year 2024 outlook. Welltower reported second quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.42 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $1.05 per diluted share, representing 16.7% year-over-year growth or 19% year-over-year growth after adjusting for relief funds received in Q2 2023. We also reported total portfolio of same-store NOI growth of 11.3% year-over-year. Now turning to performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage stats are reported a quarter in arrears, so these statistics reflect the trailing twelve months ending 03/31/2024. In our Senior Housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 4.3% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is 1.4 times, marking a new post-COVID high in coverage. In the quarter, we reached agreements to transition 36 properties operated by Storypoint and New Perspective from triple-net to RIDEA effective 3Q bringing total year-to-date RIDEA transitions to 47. Consistent with our strategy over the past two years, these conversions, despite being short-term dilutive, should prove highly accretive over time. As Welltower moves into the equity position these assets continue to benefit from post-COVID recovery in fundamentals and the industry's long-term secular growth trends. In the case of these two operators, it also moves our entire relationship to RIDEA, creating complete alignment across our portfolio of properties with them. Next, same-store NOI growth in our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was $1.47 times, which represents an increase from 1.23 times last quarter as more of the recovery in the Integra Healthcare portfolio is reflected in our coverage metrics. Moving on to capital activity. We continue to equity finance our investment activity in the quarter, raising $1.6 billion of gross proceeds at an average price of $96.64 per share. This allowed us to fund $1.2 billion of net investment activity in debt paydowns and end the quarter with $2.9 billion of cash and restricted cash on the balance sheet. In July, our treasury team, led by Matt Carrus, refinanced our revolving line of credit, achieving increased capacity by $1 billion, resulting in $5 billion of total borrowing capacity, while reducing our borrow costs by 7.5 basis points, through reduction in facility fees and base rate to so far plus 72.5 basis points and extending the maturity by two years. I want to thank our banking group for the support they continue to provide Welltower. We deeply value these longstanding relationships. In July we also issued 1.035 billion convertible notes due in 2029. Note bears interest at 3.125%, is convertible to equity at $127.91 per share. We intend to use the proceeds from the note to address our 2025 unsecured maturities coming due next June. The combination of these efficiently priced refinancings increased the total duration of our debt stack to six years and brings our total current available liquidity to $8.7 billion. Staying with the balance sheet, we ended this quarter with 3.68 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and after completing our incremental $2.7 billion in net investment activity, we expect to end the year at approximately 4.25 times net debt to EBITDA. The resiliency of our business model, trajectory of our future growth and strength of our balance sheet recognized by S&P and Moody's in the quarter as they both moved their outlooks on our BBB+ BAA1 credit ratings to positive during the quarter. Lastly, as I move on to last night's update of our full year 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not included any investment activity in our outlook beyond the $4.9 billion to date that has been closed or publicly announced. Last night, we updated our full year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to $01.52 to $01.60 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $04.13 to $04.21 per diluted share, or $04.17 at the midpoint. This guidance increase represents an incremental increase in the midpoint of $0.06 per share from a NAREIT guidance and 8\u00bd cents per share from our first quarter normalized FFO guidance. The 8\u00bd cents at the midpoint is composed of 3\u00bd from an improved NOI outlook in our Senior Housing operating portfolio and 6\u00bd cents from accretive investment and financing activity, offset partially by a 1\u00bd penny from higher G&A expectations and near-term drag from triple-net to RIDEA conversions. Underlying this increased FFO guidance is an increase in estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth to 10% to 12.5%, driven by subsegment growth of Outpatient Medical 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute 2% to 3%, Senior Housing triple-net 3% to 4% and finally Senior Housing operating growth of 19% to 23%. This is driven by the following midpoints of their respective ranges. Revenue growth of 9.2% made up of RevPOR growth of 5.25% and year-over-year occupancy growth of 290 basis points and total expense growth of 5.5%. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. In an effort to give you our owners a bit more insight on how we're thinking about the world today, we'd like to share a few macro observations. As we think about the last few decades over, there were several factors that provided a strong tailwind for investment returns of risk assets. Rates have gone from high to low. We printed an awful lot of money. We brought future demand forward through fiscal borrowing almost everywhere in the world, including U.S., Europe, Japan, and China. We benefited from globalization that led to lower inflation, and we benefited, for the most part, an era of peace and cooperation after the cold war. Our management team has and continues to debate if some of these tailwinds will turn into headwinds as we think about our investment time horizon, at the very least, questioning if these factors become the lack of tailwind. This is especially relevant in the context of a few additional questions. First, society is aging quickly in our markets. Is this trend inflationary or deflationary? Second, given the current sovereign debt levels and fiscal policy, what will happen to the long end of the rate curve, regardless of Fed actions? Third, now that the anchor of global yield, Japan has overcome zero lower bound, will the normal be higher for U.S. rates? We have no idea how to answer any of these questions definitively. And to further complicate the picture is the interplay of this question against the backdrop of substantially reduced tailwinds, which I mentioned before. We do acknowledge that they will have an impact on investments we are making today, some negatively, some positively. However, the beauty of our strategy and the platform is that we don't need these tailwinds to work in our favor. Let me expand. Would we benefit from a lower rate environment in which our assets we own will be worth more? Would such an environment turn our incredibly low leverage balance sheet into a powerful asset that we prudently tap into to drive partial earnings? Absolutely. Would it be fine, if not thrive, if we remain in a world of high long rates for an extended period of time? Unquestionably, as construction will remain subdued for foreseeable future and will continue to help solve broken capital structure problems? Let's consider another issue, the aging of the population. While we're extremely excited about the higher end market demand that this trend will drive for many years, it also begs the question, is the demographic shift inflationary or deflationary in nature from a societal standpoint? If you are certain that the grain of our society is deflationary force, then we would be investing in middle market AL product, which we are not. We're sticking to AL product in micro markets where we have conviction that we can achieve sufficient pricing power to pass on inflation and then some. This is especially important to us given overall lack of growth of caregivers commensurate with an older population. Hence our obsession with product market fit. Amongst all these uncertainties we contend with on a daily basis, whether it be the direction of the economy, rates or geopolitics, what is certain is that we're in the midst of one of the most pronounced demographic shift ever witnessed, and it's occurring at the same time at which the challenges for new construction remain extraordinarily high. To put simply, we believe that we are in the very early inning of an exceptional multiyear growth for the industry and add into John's and what our operations team is doing to drive digital transformation of Senior Housing industry, which should result in higher employee and customer satisfaction. We're confident in our ability to compound on a per share basis over a very long period of time for our owners. We as capital allocators and long-term investors will take compounding per share of earnings over speculation of macro all day long. Long-term compounding is the only way we're aware of is to create real shareholder wealth. As Buffett tells us, predicting rent doesn't count, building an ark does. I truly believe we have built an all-weather compounding ark that will continue to reward our owners across different environments for the years into the future. As proud as I am of the exceptional execution of the Welltower team in recent quarters, I'm convinced the best days of this company are squared in front of us. And with that, let's open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJonathan Hughes: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time. Shankh, I think I heard you say there's $70 million and $40 million of future cash flow upside over the next few years from recent triple-net to RIDEA transitions and about 7.5% is in place NOIs from Seniors Housing triple-net. I realize that's going to decline as we see some of those announced transitions be completed. But how much of the 7.5% could we see or do you want to see convert to RIDEA so that Welltower can participate in more cash flow and value creation upside? Thank you.\nShankh Mitra: Yes Jonathan, we are focused on growing with a set of operators that we find to be exceptionally good in their region at their price point for their product. And there remains portfolios in our triple-net that fits that bucket and over time, you can expect us to continue to work through that and convert into RIDEA. And there will be assets in triple-net that will remain triple-net because we think, though for those assets, primarily midmarket assets, that's the right structure. We've got to think about long-term. Obviously, as I mentioned last time, I think our last call I mentioned that our underlying EBITDA in our triple-net portfolio is actually growing slightly faster than our RIDEA portfolio purely because of the geographic mix. That's primarily U.S. and UK. But it will not be prudent for us to think, let's just convert the whole thing, because right now we have the growth. We have to think about long-term and think about the growth prospects beyond stabilization relative to what we think inflation will be over a period of time. But there are opportunities, and you can imagine that we're hard at work, continue to work through with our partners to structure win-win deals.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nVikram Malhotra: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just Shankh, building on your last comment, I mean I don't know what innings we are in terms of the recovery, but whatever phase we're in. Can you just maybe elaborate give us color on sort of what gets you through this next phase of growth, both internal and external? And I just mean like the components that drove internal expenses and better pricing power seemed sustainable. If you can comment on that, as well as on the external growth, just curious, the acquisitions you're doing, like how much occupancy upside do they have relative to the portfolio? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Yes Vikram, let me see if I can remember all the questions you asked. Let's just start with the acquisitions. Roughly, you should think industry is in low-80s occupancy and there's no reason to believe for obviously in the aggregate amount that we are acquiring anything, but in that sort of market rate occupancy, call it low 80%. So we think there is substantial occupancy upside. And I've said many, many times, really the toughest part of the margin story is sort of call it 80% to low 80% occupancy and majority of the flow through happens after that. So not only occupancy upside, you should see tremendous amount of cash flow upside into that. We have never been yield buyers and will never be yield buyers. We are total return buyers and that's how we think about investments, so that's sort of one aspect of your question. The second question is harder to answer, and I absolutely do not want you to sort of take this as my forward-looking comments. I have no idea. But as we are thinking about supply/demand in our markets, but more importantly, my earlier comment that all the platform initiatives that John and his team has been building towards, we should see impact starting 2025. So if you just sort of think about that aspect of it, I think occupancy can, I'm not saying it will, but can take a leg up as we think about 2025. But now if we sort of look into the different strata of pricing in different types of occupancy in our own portfolio today, I will share an observation with you that above 90%, let's take it this quarter, obviously to make a point not to specifically numbers, just if we think about 90% plus occupancy cohort of our portfolio, RIDEA portfolio, RevPOR growth was close to 7%. So our goal is for us, what we are trying to do is to get the portfolio to that level as the industry also fills up. So is it possible that as we go into a 2026, sort of summer of 2026 or summer of 2027, we see a leg up in rates again? Absolutely we can. But this is too early to comment, but we'll see what market gives us. We're so far very pleased with how this summer season is playing out. July has been a very strong month for us and we hope that sort of the summer season play out strong, but it's too early to comment how next couple of years play out. But I wouldn't leave this question without answering the crux of what you asked. What innings we're in this growth cycle? Very early.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. Good morning. Just a question first on the Senior Housing guidance, can you just talk about why you didn't revise the same-store revenue guidance for the segment? And then if we look at the sequential occupancy growth in the quarter, bit lighter than it's been previously in second quarter, so just trying to understand that impact in the quarter. And then for the back half of the year, it feels like there's a bigger sequential ramp that's going to happen to get to the full year guidance. I just want to make sure that's correct. And maybe you had some commentary on July or anything else that gives you sort of confidence in that back half of the year occupancy plan. Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Nick, let me try and I think John or Tim, you can jump in as you fit. There are several questions I'm not sure I remember of them all. First is the occupancy. I think you heard John's comment that we have thousands of units that are under renovation that's going through. A lot of units are actually offline, so that might have contributed, as John said, that will impact or has impacted some near-term fundamentals. I've said this million times that we will always sacrifice short-term for long-term. We would expect that will augment our 2025 growth, but we are confident achieving obviously the NOI growth that we have put out otherwise we would not be raising that guidance. What was the other question, second half? Look, the thing is, if you think about the summer selling season, I sort of think about that June, July, August, September phenomenon. We got one month obviously in the quarter. We're pleased with June. That's sort of, this is the second quarter is always the second half sort of growth as we come out of the spring season, and it's really July, August, September that makes or breaks the year and we're very pleased with July and I have nothing more to add to that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes, good morning, everyone. Tim I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you plan to lean into the balance sheet as a driver of future growth. Maybe you've really taken the leverage down and just thinking about like the opportunity set as you go forward?\nTimothy McHugh: Thanks, Josh. So I think the key point for us is there is no plan to lean into it. As we sit here today, it just represents optionality. And so think about how, where we're at from a leverage standpoint and how we're still continuing to fund our investment pipeline. It's all about what we can't plan for. And at that point, it provides you the backstop and the ability to continue doing what we're doing and the business model doesn't need to change in really any macro backdrop.\nShankh Mitra: But Josh, if you just think about longer term basis, there is massive organic deleveraging that's happening, and at the same time, the free cash flow generation is significantly picking up. You are onto something as you think about a longer term capital structure. We clearly don't think if we just stay where it is and organic deleveraging continues to happen, we'll be three times leverage soon. We don't think that's where a company of our size and scale should work at. So there is definite capacity to tap into to drive partial growth. But as Tim pointed out, that if the optionality, that's what I'm focused on. It's not a question of what we will in a given period of time do. It's the question is what we can. And as sort of, as you think about worst and normalized earnings for this company, if you think about that in terms of normalized balance sheet, not a point in time balance sheet that's too highly leveraged or too lowly leveraged as we are.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of John [indiscernible] with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. In your opening remarks, you mentioned the operating leverage that's inherent in the business. Maybe could you talk about run rate where you think that that can take margins to?\nShankh Mitra: I think you're asking us to speculate on longer term margin. I'm not going to do that. I will just say that we are -- that depends on occupancy and all the -- some sort of all the operating platform initiatives that John has been building towards. But as we have said before, that if we can take margin higher than pre-COVID margins, that at the very least you can expect the significant G&A savings for both me and John stepping down. Either way we should be making money either through that margin expansion or through our failure of getting to where we think we should be through G&A reduction.\nOperator: And the next question comes to the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Griffin: Great, thanks. I'd be curious to get some more color just on the investment environment and acquisition opportunities you're seeing out there. Has there started to be more competition for the product that you are looking to acquire or are capital partners looking to come solely to you I think similar to what we've seen so far this year. And then maybe if you can comment on the transaction market broadly, are you seeing mainly stabilized product trade or some more of that value add component?\nShankh Mitra: Yes. So I'll try to start. Nikhil, please jump in. So it depends on where in the product cycle you have availability of debt. So if you think about more stable product, which has in place significant occupancy and significant in place cash flow that still can be financed. So if there is any competition, then that competition is there. We have no interest in buying that product. We are total return investor. You have to think about if you buy in 90%, 95% occupied Senior Housing building, no matter what cap rate you buy at, you will end up being at a basis that at least for most cases is not acceptable to us. For us, it's always about basis and staying power. That's how we invest capital. So if there is any sort of interest or it's just purely on availability of debt. We play at a space where we are much more interested in future upside, much more interested in bringing our operators to change the operating platform and operating environment and that's why we don't. We just, obviously we have put up this kind of investment volume purely because people are coming to us directly before they go to market. You will see things that go to market a lot of times. We have looked at it and then decided that's not a fit to our portfolio. This company is not designed to buy. We're trying to invest capital and build our regional density. So we think about assets and one asset at a time, depending on what other assets we own in those markets with those operators and that's how we think about this business.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Carroll: Yes, thanks. Nikhil, I wanted to touch on your comment that you made in your prepared remarks regarding foreign counterparties. Do you know, or I guess, how much seniors housing exposure do these parties have and why are they looking to exit or reduce their exposure? I mean, are they just looking to completely get out of the business or are they just looking for a partner that can help them kind of capture some of the seniors housing upside that they might not be able to do themselves?\nNikhil Chaudhri: Yes, I think I'll start with the reason they're looking to get out. It's the same as domestic counterparties, right? It's debt pressure. Now, obviously foreign counterparties have the benefit that their net outcome in their local currency is not as bad, given that the dollar is fairly strong, but the reasons are the same. And at least in the transactions that we're working on with a few of these counterparties, it has been to buy them out completely, not joint ventures or anything like that. So we're looking to do simple asset acquisitions like we have been in the U.S.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, a question for Shankh or John. You talked about platform investments starting to drive growth for the SHO business in 2025. So just curious if you can make some general comments about what success would mean for you with regard to the platform investments and the growth contributions in 2025?\nShankh Mitra: One, I think I have already hinted about this to Vikram's question earlier, but we're very, as I said, we're very pleased with the occupancy growth over the last couple of years, including this year. But if we -- all the initiatives that John has been building towards, if that can enhance that growth, we'll be very pleased. We shall see. Even this year is not over yet. It's hard to comment on next year, but we'll be very pleased if that happens.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Mueller: Yes, hi. Your development pipeline and commitments are about 75% Senior Housing and 25% Outpatient Medical, I guess how do you see these dollars invested and the mix between the two trending over the next few years?\nNikhil Chaudhri: Yes, I think I just want to clarify when you said 75% Seniors Housing. On our development page, we provide in the stock, we provide a breakdown by units. And what you'll see is, it's predominantly Wellness Housing, which is age restricted or age targeted product, low service. So it's not traditional Seniors Housing. I mean, there's barely any Seniors Housing in there in the U.S. There are a couple of projects in the UK. But as Shankh mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have not been able to make Seniors Housing developments spend and so it makes no sense to do something that doesn't work out.\nOperator: And your next question comes on the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJames Kammert: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Actually, just building on that prior question, when you think about the Wellness Housing segment, what is the organic growth profile there, say contrasted with let's call it more traditional Senior Housing, the [indiscernible] AL, et cetera? Thank you.\nNikhil Chaudhri: I think I mentioned that two quarters ago or maybe even last quarter, I don't recall, but you can go back and check. But since 2018, we have built this business to about 25,000 units that the whole business, through a pandemic compounded roughly between 8% to 10%. So that's obviously, as you know, these communities are highly occupied and despite that, they're compounded at that level. I hope so that gives you a sense of why we're excited about the business.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, thanks so much. So looking at the cash flow statement, looked like you generated $1 billion of operating cash flow over a six-month period, which is looks to me like a first for the company. I know John is doing a lot on the operational side, which we'll see in 2025, but curious if there's any sort of thought either in sort of working capital efficiency, CapEx, as you're thinking about free cash flow, as you sort of scale and continue to grow these businesses, are there still sort of potential upside drivers to that? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: Ron, I would say we're in the very early innings of seeing upside. I think John mentioned in his prepared remarks that for the exact same scope of work in exact same places, we're able to drive 25% to 50% lower cost on CapEx initiatives and all and more importantly, we can drive at a much faster turnaround. Just if you think through that, the biggest question that we have in front of us, what's the frictional vacancy? Time is much more important than even money, right? Because turnaround time equals to occupancy, equals to your higher NOI, permanently sort of your stabilized NOI. So you just think about that. We're super excited about it. There's a lot going on in the company, but we are excited about, at the end of the day about free cash flow generation. So that\u2019s to answer earlier question on balance sheet, I mentioned that just think through where free cash flow generation will be when we get to your definition of frictional vacancy. So we're excited about it. We're driving cash flow at the end of the day, that's all that matters and we think we're in the very early inning of that. There's a lot to come.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Your line is open.\nRich Anderson: Hey, thanks and good morning. So I want to talk about the longer term growth potential of Senior Housing, SHO, assuming it's not 20%. And despite everything that you said, when you think about RevPAR or RevPOR, I know you're focused more on the spread. So even if inflation subsides, I think you still get what you want there. But then on occupancy gains, I wonder if you would agree that it's harder to get from 85 to 90 than it is to get from 75 to 80. Just generally in life, is that last mile of occupancy harder than the first mile? And so when you think about that, but then you layer in the fact this is a very small industry, right? It's 1 million, 1.5 million units in the U.S. and I wonder if that sort of dispels this occupancy theory I have, because there are so few options. And if you can, at the end of the day, when you roll up all these thoughts, is the sort of the growth profile of senior housing long-term still approaching 20% when you think about all this or is it something significantly less than that, but still impressive? Thanks.\nShankh Mitra: So first, let's talk about what we disagree. Let's not take example of what exactly you said. I'll tell you, it's much harder to get to 95% than actually stay at 95%. So your basic assumption that it gets harder as you go on the occupancy assumption is exactly opposite of what our assumption is. So that's sort of the number one point. Number two is what is the future growth of senior housing as a business? We will debate that when we get there. Our first goal is, as I mentioned, you probably have picked up on my earlier comments, that as you stabilize assets, your ability to charge or your ability to get to higher RevPOR increases pretty dramatically. Right? So that's basic supply/demand. And so first, our goal is to get the whole portfolio there. And as you know, we're constantly reloading the gun. We're constantly buying lower occupancy buildings. And Nikhil bought a bunch of buildings this quarter that are 40% occupied, 50% occupied. Right? So we have a few years of work ahead of us to get to the portfolio to where we believe frictional vacancy is. And it sounds like you and we have a very different opinion of what the frictional vacancy is. But let's just get there and after that we'll debate what the long-term NOI growth of the business looks like. However, I'll give you a hint to think about on your own. Think about what operational leverage at different level of occupancy is. The NOI growth is a function of at a occupancy level, what your flow through margins are. And as you know, flow through margins goes up as occupancy goes up. Purely that's called operational leverage, right? That's just operating leverage. Once you think through that, you can come to that conclusion yourself. But we're not going to sit here and speculate. We first need to get to the Promised Land.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes, thanks. I wanted to hit on John's comments around focusing on lower acuity customers, and I'm just curious how long the tail is to continue to draw upon that resident base. And given the longer lifecycle that you referenced, how does that play into your ability to sustain kind of the RevPOR, ExpPOR spread that you're focused on?\nTimothy McHugh: We have a long Runway here, but again, just going back a step. So we're all on the same page. So myself coming from the multifamily world, when you looked at rent effectively, you're looking and saying, okay, bigger rents are better because largely the expenses are banked irrespective of occupancy. When you switch into senior housing, it's a different story because higher rents are in part reflective of higher acuity. Higher acuity requires higher care and therefore cost and therefore higher RevPOR doesn't necessarily mean higher NOI. And so what my comments were in my script and what Shankh talked about is we're focused on optimizing NOI, increasing NOI, and in doing so, clearly targeting lower acuity residents coming in who have longer stays, all in lower care, all goes towards, in the AL world, all goes towards maximizing NOI and NOI growth over time. We're at the very beginning of that process and we put a lot of work into it, but obviously it takes time to work through all the different [indiscernible], all the different properties. So we have a ways to go and then that's completely obviously separated from all the other operating initiatives we have going on which have a positive impact in both areas, RevPOR and ExpPOR.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone and again, congrats on another standout quarter. I'm curious about the SHO portfolio, again the operating margin is still in the high 20s now. I'm kind of curious that step to kind of go back to pre-pandemic highs of margins in the 30s, what has to kind of happen to kind of get there? Is it still further moderation in labor costs? Is it additional occupancy pick up even though occupancy is pretty high relative to pre-pandemic levels? I'm just wondering how we kind of think about getting back to that kind of NOI margin over the next 12 to 24 months.\nNikhil Chaudhri: Yes, Omotayo, good morning. So first I just want to clarify that we're not just thinking about going back to pre-pandemic margins. As I said, that if that's all we do, we failed. So, but what needs to happen to get to a higher level of occupancy, a higher level of margin, is simply we need to get to higher level occupancy. So I think there's a lot of businesses you guys follow and cover and all and generally speaking, it's in our head that pre-pandemic was good. We have to remember that pre-pandemic for Senior Housing business was actually pretty bad times. Right? We got a few years of oversupply situations from call it 15 to 18, pre-pandemic wasn't good time. So we should not target to get to pre-pandemic. But to answer your question, occupancy needs to be higher for us to get there. And hopefully what you heard today, that we're excited about occupancy growth this year, excited about occupancy growth next year, and we hope that we will get to those margins as occupancy builds.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open.\nWesley Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. Can you talk about what is the timeline to stabilize your Wellness Housing developments and how much does falling lumber impact the development costs?\nTimothy McHugh: It's about 12 to 18 months. So that if we think about stabilization, just think about kind of two summers what it takes to lease up these communities.\nNikhil Chaudhri: I think on the lumber point that has helped, but overall cost of development has not come down. If you put everything in the blender with different contractors, different trades, labor cost, construction cost is still higher than it was a couple of years ago, meaningfully.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Emily Meckler with Green Street. Your line is open.\nEmily Meckler: Good morning, guys. On the last earnings call, you mentioned a significant amount of distressing your housing opportunities in the market. What percentage of these at risk of [indiscernible] properties holding roughly on 16 billion inclusive of agency and bank loans outstanding? Would you consider the quality and price you'd be willing to buy?\nShankh Mitra: Emily, I'm not going to try to speculate on what percent of that we will be willing to buy. We, as I've said that we don't have an amount in our mind that we want to buy. We're investors, we're not deal junkies. Our entire strategy is based on something very simple, which is want to build regional density and grow with our operating platforms. There are operating partners and as we see one asset at a time and we think about how it fits to the asset that we own in that area, we will make a decision to acquire or not acquire at a price. So it's a very strategic decision, deliberate decision that is taken on one asset at a time. You can see Nikhil said we acquired 7000 units to 82 different communities and we made 82 different deliberate decisions. This is not let's go buy senior living and buy x billion dollars at y percent spread. That's just exactly what we don't do. So I'm not going to sit here and speculate. But I will tell you that we see a lot of motivated counterparties who wants us to help them solve that debt problem and we're happy to do so.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks John. It's hard to believe that we're almost at the end of the summer. We have worked tirelessly over the last three months since our first quarter call, expanding on our investment activity by an additional 2.1 billion. Since we have been working at such a torrid pace, I thought it would be helpful to summarize what we have accomplished so far this year. We closed on $200 million of transactions in the first quarter and announced additional transaction activity of 2.6 billion on our first quarter call. We subsequently signed up and announced another $1 billion of transactions at NAREIT in June and last night announced an incremental $1.1 billion of acquisitions, bringing this year's total closed or under contract transactions to $4.9 billion. We are pleased to report that as of the end of the second quarter, we have closed on $1.6 billion of these transactions and we are diligently working towards closing the remainder of our announced transaction activity by year-end. The incremental $2.1 billion of investment activity announced since our first quarter call is essentially entirely made up of seniors and wellness housing assets in the U.S. and UK and spans a total of 17 transactions with a median transaction size of $65 million. These transactions comprise of 82 communities with nearly 7000 units, an average age of seven years and a stabilized yield above 8%. Through these transactions, we are growing our relationships with Legend, Storypoint, QSL, Care UK, Arrow Senior Living, to name a few operators. Welltower's stellar reputation permeates globally as we remain the counterparty of choice for sellers, as evidenced by the unabated quality and pace of our investment activity. I want to highlight an emerging new trend that we have witnessed recently, inbound inquiries from Asian and continental European investors who own seniors housing product in our target markets. Perhaps driven by the strength of the dollar, but we are seeing direct inquiries to acquire senior housing assets from foreign counterparties who we have not transacted with before. During this quarter, we had net loan funding of $349 million as we originated $486 million of new loans and received repayments of $137 million across 17 loans. A vast majority of the new lending activity was with one high quality sponsor from whom we also acquired a portfolio of seniors housing assets. As I have stated before, we are creative deal makers with a problem solving mindset. I spoke last quarter about the dearth of debt capital in the Seniors Housing space, and I'm pleased to announce that we have been able to close out a creative win-win transaction with a counterparty given that backdrop. We previously transacted with this counterparty last year when we acquired 10 Seniors Housing assets for $469 million. We reengaged with them this year for a follow-on transaction. In this case, for a subset of the portfolio spanning roughly 1000 units we were able to see eye-to-eye on upfront pricing of $271 million and acquired those assets outright at a greater than 35% discount or replacement cost assuming a maximum payout on the performance based earn-out. For another subset of assets, we couldn't find alignment on the current valuation, but we were able to offer a creative debt solution. This $456 million first mortgage loan carries a 10% yield and spans nearly 1000 units across several newly built marquee senior housing properties with the last dollar basis at approximately half of replacement cost of these light new assets, this loan reflects a 56% loan to value based on our underwritten stabilized values. As with most of our loans, there are several structural enhancements to potentially convert these shorter duration debt investments into long duration equity investments. This entire transaction is underwritten to achieve an unlevered IRR north of 10%. Moving on to capital light transactions, as announced earlier, we are transitioning 89 former Holiday assets from Atria to six different regional managers. 69 of these transitions are already complete, and the remaining 20 are scheduled for later this week. As was our business plan all along, we have plans for significant capital investment across all these buildings. 65% of these projects are either completed or underway, with the remaining working through plans, scopes and budgets to start soon. With an inventory of over 900 modernized light new units, the newly appointed regional managers are hard at work in training the sales teams to market the enhanced value proposition of these communities. While we have been disappointed with the results achieved to date, we remain optimistic that we'll soon recognize significant operational upside in this portfolio through our focused regional density strategy. Yes, I think I'll start with the reason they're looking to get out. It's the same as domestic counterparties, right? It's debt pressure. Now, obviously foreign counterparties have the benefit that their net outcome in their local currency is not as bad, given that the dollar is fairly strong, but the reasons are the same. And at least in the transactions that we're working on with a few of these counterparties, it has been to buy them out completely, not joint ventures or anything like that. So we're looking to do simple asset acquisitions like we have been in the U.S. Yes, I think I just want to clarify when you said 75% Seniors Housing. On our development page, we provide in the stock, we provide a breakdown by units. And what you'll see is, it's predominantly Wellness Housing, which is age restricted or age targeted product, low service. So it's not traditional Seniors Housing. I mean, there's barely any Seniors Housing in there in the U.S. There are a couple of projects in the UK. But as Shankh mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have not been able to make Seniors Housing developments spend and so it makes no sense to do something that doesn't work out. I think I mentioned that two quarters ago or maybe even last quarter, I don't recall, but you can go back and check. But since 2018, we have built this business to about 25,000 units that the whole business, through a pandemic compounded roughly between 8% to 10%. So that's obviously, as you know, these communities are highly occupied and despite that, they're compounded at that level. I hope so that gives you a sense of why we're excited about the business. Yes, Omotayo, good morning. So first I just want to clarify that we're not just thinking about going back to pre-pandemic margins. As I said, that if that's all we do, we failed. So, but what needs to happen to get to a higher level of occupancy, a higher level of margin, is simply we need to get to higher level occupancy. So I think there's a lot of businesses you guys follow and cover and all and generally speaking, it's in our head that pre-pandemic was good. We have to remember that pre-pandemic for Senior Housing business was actually pretty bad times. Right? We got a few years of oversupply situations from call it 15 to 18, pre-pandemic wasn't good time. So we should not target to get to pre-pandemic. But to answer your question, occupancy needs to be higher for us to get there. And hopefully what you heard today, that we're excited about occupancy growth this year, excited about occupancy growth next year, and we hope that we will get to those margins as occupancy builds. I think on the lumber point that has helped, but overall cost of development has not come down. If you put everything in the blender with different contractors, different trades, labor cost, construction cost is still higher than it was a couple of years ago, meaningfully."

We will remain disciplined in our funding of our future opportunities. But as I have previously mentioned, we have created significant debt capacity to tap into creating another lever for us to further augment our earnings growth. With that, I'll pass it over to John."

            "name": "Timothy McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, performance of our triple-net investment segments, our capital activity, our balance sheet liquidity update and finally an update to our full year 2024 outlook. Welltower reported second quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.42 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $1.05 per diluted share, representing 16.7% year-over-year growth or 19% year-over-year growth after adjusting for relief funds received in Q2 2023. We also reported total portfolio of same-store NOI growth of 11.3% year-over-year. Now turning to performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage stats are reported a quarter in arrears, so these statistics reflect the trailing twelve months ending 03/31/2024. In our Senior Housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 4.3% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is 1.4 times, marking a new post-COVID high in coverage. In the quarter, we reached agreements to transition 36 properties operated by Storypoint and New Perspective from triple-net to RIDEA effective 3Q bringing total year-to-date RIDEA transitions to 47. Consistent with our strategy over the past two years, these conversions, despite being short-term dilutive, should prove highly accretive over time. As Welltower moves into the equity position these assets continue to benefit from post-COVID recovery in fundamentals and the industry's long-term secular growth trends. In the case of these two operators, it also moves our entire relationship to RIDEA, creating complete alignment across our portfolio of properties with them. Next, same-store NOI growth in our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was $1.47 times, which represents an increase from 1.23 times last quarter as more of the recovery in the Integra Healthcare portfolio is reflected in our coverage metrics. Moving on to capital activity. We continue to equity finance our investment activity in the quarter, raising $1.6 billion of gross proceeds at an average price of $96.64 per share. This allowed us to fund $1.2 billion of net investment activity in debt paydowns and end the quarter with $2.9 billion of cash and restricted cash on the balance sheet. In July, our treasury team, led by Matt Carrus, refinanced our revolving line of credit, achieving increased capacity by $1 billion, resulting in $5 billion of total borrowing capacity, while reducing our borrow costs by 7.5 basis points, through reduction in facility fees and base rate to so far plus 72.5 basis points and extending the maturity by two years. I want to thank our banking group for the support they continue to provide Welltower. We deeply value these longstanding relationships. In July we also issued 1.035 billion convertible notes due in 2029. Note bears interest at 3.125%, is convertible to equity at $127.91 per share. We intend to use the proceeds from the note to address our 2025 unsecured maturities coming due next June. The combination of these efficiently priced refinancings increased the total duration of our debt stack to six years and brings our total current available liquidity to $8.7 billion. Staying with the balance sheet, we ended this quarter with 3.68 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and after completing our incremental $2.7 billion in net investment activity, we expect to end the year at approximately 4.25 times net debt to EBITDA. The resiliency of our business model, trajectory of our future growth and strength of our balance sheet recognized by S&P and Moody's in the quarter as they both moved their outlooks on our BBB+ BAA1 credit ratings to positive during the quarter. Lastly, as I move on to last night's update of our full year 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not included any investment activity in our outlook beyond the $4.9 billion to date that has been closed or publicly announced. Last night, we updated our full year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to $01.52 to $01.60 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $04.13 to $04.21 per diluted share, or $04.17 at the midpoint. This guidance increase represents an incremental increase in the midpoint of $0.06 per share from a NAREIT guidance and 81\u20442 cents per share from our first quarter normalized FFO guidance. The 81\u20442 cents at the midpoint is composed of 31\u20442 from an improved NOI outlook in our Senior Housing operating portfolio and 61\u20442 cents from accretive investment and financing activity, offset partially by a 11\u20442 penny from higher G&A expectations and near-term drag from triple-net to RIDEA conversions. Underlying this increased FFO guidance is an increase in estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth to 10% to 12.5%, driven by subsegment growth of Outpatient Medical 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute 2% to 3%, Senior Housing triple-net 3% to 4% and finally Senior Housing operating growth of 19% to 23%. This is driven by the following midpoints of their respective ranges. Revenue growth of 9.2% made up of RevPOR growth of 5.25% and year-over-year occupancy growth of 290 basis points and total expense growth of 5.5%. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Thanks, Josh. So I think the key point for us is there is no plan to lean into it. As we sit here today, it just represents optionality. And so think about how, where we're at from a leverage standpoint and how we're still continuing to fund our investment pipeline. It's all about what we can't plan for. And at that point, it provides you the backstop and the ability to continue doing what we're doing and the business model doesn't need to change in really any macro backdrop. We have a long Runway here, but again, just going back a step. So we're all on the same page. So myself coming from the multifamily world, when you looked at rent effectively, you're looking and saying, okay, bigger rents are better because largely the expenses are banked irrespective of occupancy. When you switch into senior housing, it's a different story because higher rents are in part reflective of higher acuity. Higher acuity requires higher care and therefore cost and therefore higher RevPOR doesn't necessarily mean higher NOI. And so what my comments were in my script and what Shankh talked about is we're focused on optimizing NOI, increasing NOI, and in doing so, clearly targeting lower acuity residents coming in who have longer stays, all in lower care, all goes towards, in the AL world, all goes towards maximizing NOI and NOI growth over time. We're at the very beginning of that process and we put a lot of work into it, but obviously it takes time to work through all the different [indiscernible], all the different properties. So we have a ways to go and then that's completely obviously separated from all the other operating initiatives we have going on which have a positive impact in both areas, RevPOR and ExpPOR. It's about 12 to 18 months. So that if we think about stabilization, just think about kind of two summers what it takes to lease up these communities."

            "name": "RevPOR",
            "content": "RevPOR: While margin remains well below pre-COVID levels, I would note that we have made significant progress since hitting the trough levels of profitability in 2021, with farther upside remaining through the scaling benefits achieved through higher occupancy aka operating leverage and as the operating platform begins to bear fruit. Overall, while we are pleased with the results we achieved this quarter, what we are much more excited about is the fundamental backdrop is for us to dramatically improve as we look forward to 25 and beyond. It starts with end market demand. Baby boomers are just entering their eighties and pickup in demand, which we have recently witnessed, will only intensify going forward. Not only is the 80 plus population growing at a fastest clip in decades, but what's even more compelling is the growth of this group of seniors will accelerate to 5% to 7% per annum as we close out the decade, driving demand even higher and there is plummeting new supply. The second quarter construction starts were once again negligible, falling well below trough levels you've seen even during GFC. It remains extraordinarily challenging to secure construction financing as regional banks that served as the most prolific lender to the sector in previous cycles has effectively shut down all activity. And despite the attractive growth prospect of our industry, most developers have thrown in the towel due to a lack of development economics. We think this will continue as returns, or should I say lack thereof, were made on other people's money, no longer available as investors lick their wounds from the last cycle. While the beta of the Senior Housing business remains extraordinarily attractive, what truly sets us apart are our efforts to generate outsized alpha for our existing owners. This is reflected by the difficult but important steps that we continue to take to further amplify our long-term growth trajectory. This not only includes the build out of our operating platform, which John will get into in a minute, but also involves numerous capital light transactions such as operator transitions, conversion and conversion of triple-net and to RIDEA leased structures. We are confident that several operating platform initiatives will start to impact occupancy and NOI next year. Expanding on the theme of enhancing long-term growth through capitalized transactions, we announced transition of 89 Holiday by Atria assets to six Welltower's strongest operating partners with deep expertise and local scale in their regions. We have experienced tremendous success with hundreds of transition we have effectuated in recent years and we expect similar outcomes from this most recent set of assets. More importantly, we hope to achieve over $70 million of additional NOI upside when new operators stabilize these properties. And separately, we converted or agreed to convert 47 triple-net leased properties to RIDEA structure in Q2, allowing us to directly participate in substantial growth of these properties that are poised to deliver in coming years."

That's how impactful the math is for our near to medium term growth and clearly our owners will capture all the upside from stabilization of this asset, which should enhance our long-term earnings growth trajectory as well. Turning to investment activity, last night we announced additional investment activity that brings us to nearly $5 billion of transactions closed or under contract to close year-to-date. The U.S. and UK comprised of the bulk of our recent transaction with virtually all transaction being completed in Senior Housing space. Our investment teams remain busy as ever as the opportunity to acquire senior housing assets continue to expand, largely from resulting of the broken capital structure and other debt driven situations that Nikhil described on last call. Notably, while 2023 was a record year for us with $5 billion of investment, we have achieved this level of transaction activity in just first seven months of 2024. Our pipeline beyond these transactions remain robust, visible, granular and actionable."

            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning. As Shankh mentioned, we reported another strong quarter with total same-store NOI growth, once again achieving double-digit levels led by our Senior Housing operating portfolio, which I'll provide more details on momentarily, but I'll first touch on our Outpatient Medical business. We reported 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth, which is in line with our expectations. Leasing velocity remains healthy, our retention rate remains strong at 93%, and our industry leading occupancy continues to be stable at 94.3%. Turning to Senior Housing, we continue to be pleased with the level of same-store NOI growth being generated by this business, which once again exceeded our expectations at 21.7%. Attaining 20% plus NOI growth for any sector is an incredible achievement, but seven consecutive quarters is truly exceptional. I'd also note that the strength of our business remains broad based, with all regions and property types posting outsized levels of growth. And as Shankh described, our confidence in generating elevated levels of growth in future years continues to grow given the extraordinarily demand-supply backdrop ahead of us and our focus on improving the operating business. In terms of same-store revenue in the quarter, we posted 8.6% growth compared to the prior year's period, with contributions from both occupancy and rate. Same-store occupancy increased 280 basis points, the highest level of year-over-year growth we've achieved in the second quarter of any year outside of 2022, when we were coming out of COVID. RevPOR growth remains healthy at 5.3% and ExpPOR increased just 1%. On the expense side, we're witnessing a couple of different factors at play. First, we continued to see a reversal of the broader inflationary pressures which impacted the business in recent years and second, we're benefiting from the operating leverage inherent in the business as we experience slowing incremental cost as occupancy increases. Another reflection of this trend is growth in comp core [ph] for compensation for occupied room, which rose just 0.9% year-over-year, well below our historical average due to the operational scaling benefits we're beginning to witness. Overall, as Shankh mentioned, our focus remains on driving the delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR substantially higher as part of our platform initiatives. To give a real time example, over the last few months, we've gone through an extensive review of different care levels across our assisted living portfolio in an effort to create greater simplification for residents and their families. As a result of this exercise, we also made the strategic decision to focus our leasing efforts on lower acuity assisted living residents across many of our communities. While a lower acuity resident pays less than a higher acuity resident for the same room, they also consume far less human resources and tend to stay longer. This creates a healthier rent roll over a longer period of time, leading to higher NOI. We are pleased to report that these initiatives are paying off as we've been able to attract a substantially lower number of lower acuity AL residents during the summer leasing season. I'm proud of what our team has been able to pull off in close coordination with our operating partners. Beyond that, we continue to make important strides in our efforts to optimize our portfolio and improve the resident and employee experience to the build out of the platform. We're going live with properties in Q3 and anticipate rolling out the end-to-end tech platform to the first operator in the near-term. The excitement of the community and corporate team is palpable as we truly streamline the business, integrating and digitizing the flow of information from the website through the CRM, the ERP and the care module, as well as other modules. Our communities will be able to eliminate most paperwork and materially reduce administrative time and simplify many processes, including the onerous move in process. Our objective of leveraging technology to improve the overall resident experience and enabling employees to focus more of their time on residents is being realized. We continue to achieve success in other initiatives, including the creation of the Cap team at Welltower, which enables Welltower to directly execute capital, renovation and facility projects on our sites in partnership with our operators. The result is that we are dramatically driving down costs 20% to 50% while improving the execution and improving the customer value proposition positioning Welltower's assets to drive compounding earnings growth for many years. Since the start of the year, we have completed or are working on about 2000 separate projects with 17 different operators at over 150 sites in three countries. As a result of the success of the teams, Welltower and our operators, we have expanded our work more than originally planned, which includes thousands of units taken offline. This important initiative will result in some near-term disruption, but has the potential to meaningfully contribute to our growth in 2025 and beyond. This tremendous amount of work requires the highest level of collaboration ever attempted and accomplished at Welltower between our operating partners, our vendors and our corporate employees. I am grateful for the support and teamwork by all involved people and most certainly the leaders of our operators who are standing side-by-side with me as we re-envision this business focused on improving both resident and employee experience. In conclusion, another great quarter, great demand-supply dynamics, technology platform is launching, the Cap team is executing and many other earnings drivers are in place to enable years of compounding earnings growth. Thank you and I'll turn the call over to Nikhil."

            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I will review first quarter business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on operational performance for our Senior Housing and Medical office portfolios. Nikhil will give you an update on investment landscape and Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and guidance updates. We're very pleased to report another quarter of significant bottom line growth with normalized FFO per share up 17% year-over-year or over 19% adjusted for prior year subsidies. Quarter was once again led by our Senior Housing portfolio, but with notable contributions from all other areas of the business, including investments. Last night we announced another $1 billion of acquisitions under contract since our last update at NEREIT Conference in June, bringing our acquisition activity to approximately $5 billion year-to-date. There continues to be no dearth of capital deployment opportunities in front of us at extraordinarily attractive economics, which I'll get into shortly. Ultimately, we're pleased to once again be able to raise our full year FFO per share guidance as we continue to capitalize on the unprecedented internal and external growth opportunity in Senior Housing. Before John goes into details, I wanted to first provide some high-level thoughts on the Senior Housing business and why we remain as optimistic as ever about its future prospects. Thank you, Tim. In an effort to give you our owners a bit more insight on how we're thinking about the world today, we'd like to share a few macro observations. As we think about the last few decades over, there were several factors that provided a strong tailwind for investment returns of risk assets. Rates have gone from high to low. We printed an awful lot of money. We brought future demand forward through fiscal borrowing almost everywhere in the world, including U.S., Europe, Japan, and China. We benefited from globalization that led to lower inflation, and we benefited, for the most part, an era of peace and cooperation after the cold war. Our management team has and continues to debate if some of these tailwinds will turn into headwinds as we think about our investment time horizon, at the very least, questioning if these factors become the lack of tailwind. This is especially relevant in the context of a few additional questions. First, society is aging quickly in our markets. Is this trend inflationary or deflationary? Second, given the current sovereign debt levels and fiscal policy, what will happen to the long end of the rate curve, regardless of Fed actions? Third, now that the anchor of global yield, Japan has overcome zero lower bound, will the normal be higher for U.S. rates? We have no idea how to answer any of these questions definitively. And to further complicate the picture is the interplay of this question against the backdrop of substantially reduced tailwinds, which I mentioned before. We do acknowledge that they will have an impact on investments we are making today, some negatively, some positively. However, the beauty of our strategy and the platform is that we don't need these tailwinds to work in our favor. Let me expand. Would we benefit from a lower rate environment in which our assets we own will be worth more? Would such an environment turn our incredibly low leverage balance sheet into a powerful asset that we prudently tap into to drive partial earnings? Absolutely. Would it be fine, if not thrive, if we remain in a world of high long rates for an extended period of time? Unquestionably, as construction will remain subdued for foreseeable future and will continue to help solve broken capital structure problems? Let's consider another issue, the aging of the population. While we're extremely excited about the higher end market demand that this trend will drive for many years, it also begs the question, is the demographic shift inflationary or deflationary in nature from a societal standpoint? If you are certain that the grain of our society is deflationary force, then we would be investing in middle market AL product, which we are not. We're sticking to AL product in micro markets where we have conviction that we can achieve sufficient pricing power to pass on inflation and then some. This is especially important to us given overall lack of growth of caregivers commensurate with an older population. Hence our obsession with product market fit. Amongst all these uncertainties we contend with on a daily basis, whether it be the direction of the economy, rates or geopolitics, what is certain is that we're in the midst of one of the most pronounced demographic shift ever witnessed, and it's occurring at the same time at which the challenges for new construction remain extraordinarily high. To put simply, we believe that we are in the very early inning of an exceptional multiyear growth for the industry and add into John's and what our operations team is doing to drive digital transformation of Senior Housing industry, which should result in higher employee and customer satisfaction. We're confident in our ability to compound on a per share basis over a very long period of time for our owners. We as capital allocators and long-term investors will take compounding per share of earnings over speculation of macro all day long. Long-term compounding is the only way we're aware of is to create real shareholder wealth. As Buffett tells us, predicting rent doesn't count, building an ark does. I truly believe we have built an all-weather compounding ark that will continue to reward our owners across different environments for the years into the future. As proud as I am of the exceptional execution of the Welltower team in recent quarters, I'm convinced the best days of this company are squared in front of us. And with that, let's open the call up for questions. Yes Jonathan, we are focused on growing with a set of operators that we find to be exceptionally good in their region at their price point for their product. And there remains portfolios in our triple-net that fits that bucket and over time, you can expect us to continue to work through that and convert into RIDEA. And there will be assets in triple-net that will remain triple-net because we think, though for those assets, primarily midmarket assets, that's the right structure. We've got to think about long-term. Obviously, as I mentioned last time, I think our last call I mentioned that our underlying EBITDA in our triple-net portfolio is actually growing slightly faster than our RIDEA portfolio purely because of the geographic mix. That's primarily U.S. and UK. But it will not be prudent for us to think, let's just convert the whole thing, because right now we have the growth. We have to think about long-term and think about the growth prospects beyond stabilization relative to what we think inflation will be over a period of time. But there are opportunities, and you can imagine that we're hard at work, continue to work through with our partners to structure win-win deals. Yes Vikram, let me see if I can remember all the questions you asked. Let's just start with the acquisitions. Roughly, you should think industry is in low-80s occupancy and there's no reason to believe for obviously in the aggregate amount that we are acquiring anything, but in that sort of market rate occupancy, call it low 80%. So we think there is substantial occupancy upside. And I've said many, many times, really the toughest part of the margin story is sort of call it 80% to low 80% occupancy and majority of the flow through happens after that. So not only occupancy upside, you should see tremendous amount of cash flow upside into that. We have never been yield buyers and will never be yield buyers. We are total return buyers and that's how we think about investments, so that's sort of one aspect of your question. The second question is harder to answer, and I absolutely do not want you to sort of take this as my forward-looking comments. I have no idea. But as we are thinking about supply/demand in our markets, but more importantly, my earlier comment that all the platform initiatives that John and his team has been building towards, we should see impact starting 2025. So if you just sort of think about that aspect of it, I think occupancy can, I'm not saying it will, but can take a leg up as we think about 2025. But now if we sort of look into the different strata of pricing in different types of occupancy in our own portfolio today, I will share an observation with you that above 90%, let's take it this quarter, obviously to make a point not to specifically numbers, just if we think about 90% plus occupancy cohort of our portfolio, RIDEA portfolio, RevPOR growth was close to 7%. So our goal is for us, what we are trying to do is to get the portfolio to that level as the industry also fills up. So is it possible that as we go into a 2026, sort of summer of 2026 or summer of 2027, we see a leg up in rates again? Absolutely we can. But this is too early to comment, but we'll see what market gives us. We're so far very pleased with how this summer season is playing out. July has been a very strong month for us and we hope that sort of the summer season play out strong, but it's too early to comment how next couple of years play out. But I wouldn't leave this question without answering the crux of what you asked. What innings we're in this growth cycle? Very early. Nick, let me try and I think John or Tim, you can jump in as you fit. There are several questions I'm not sure I remember of them all. First is the occupancy. I think you heard John's comment that we have thousands of units that are under renovation that's going through. A lot of units are actually offline, so that might have contributed, as John said, that will impact or has impacted some near-term fundamentals. I've said this million times that we will always sacrifice short-term for long-term. We would expect that will augment our 2025 growth, but we are confident achieving obviously the NOI growth that we have put out otherwise we would not be raising that guidance. What was the other question, second half? Look, the thing is, if you think about the summer selling season, I sort of think about that June, July, August, September phenomenon. We got one month obviously in the quarter. We're pleased with June. That's sort of, this is the second quarter is always the second half sort of growth as we come out of the spring season, and it's really July, August, September that makes or breaks the year and we're very pleased with July and I have nothing more to add to that. But Josh, if you just think about longer term basis, there is massive organic deleveraging that's happening, and at the same time, the free cash flow generation is significantly picking up. You are onto something as you think about a longer term capital structure. We clearly don't think if we just stay where it is and organic deleveraging continues to happen, we'll be three times leverage soon. We don't think that's where a company of our size and scale should work at. So there is definite capacity to tap into to drive partial growth. But as Tim pointed out, that if the optionality, that's what I'm focused on. It's not a question of what we will in a given period of time do. It's the question is what we can. And as sort of, as you think about worst and normalized earnings for this company, if you think about that in terms of normalized balance sheet, not a point in time balance sheet that's too highly leveraged or too lowly leveraged as we are. I think you're asking us to speculate on longer term margin. I'm not going to do that. I will just say that we are -- that depends on occupancy and all the -- some sort of all the operating platform initiatives that John has been building towards. But as we have said before, that if we can take margin higher than pre-COVID margins, that at the very least you can expect the significant G&A savings for both me and John stepping down. Either way we should be making money either through that margin expansion or through our failure of getting to where we think we should be through G&A reduction. Yes. So I'll try to start. Nikhil, please jump in. So it depends on where in the product cycle you have availability of debt. So if you think about more stable product, which has in place significant occupancy and significant in place cash flow that still can be financed. So if there is any competition, then that competition is there. We have no interest in buying that product. We are total return investor. You have to think about if you buy in 90%, 95% occupied Senior Housing building, no matter what cap rate you buy at, you will end up being at a basis that at least for most cases is not acceptable to us. For us, it's always about basis and staying power. That's how we invest capital. So if there is any sort of interest or it's just purely on availability of debt. We play at a space where we are much more interested in future upside, much more interested in bringing our operators to change the operating platform and operating environment and that's why we don't. We just, obviously we have put up this kind of investment volume purely because people are coming to us directly before they go to market. You will see things that go to market a lot of times. We have looked at it and then decided that's not a fit to our portfolio. This company is not designed to buy. We're trying to invest capital and build our regional density. So we think about assets and one asset at a time, depending on what other assets we own in those markets with those operators and that's how we think about this business. One, I think I have already hinted about this to Vikram's question earlier, but we're very, as I said, we're very pleased with the occupancy growth over the last couple of years, including this year. But if we -- all the initiatives that John has been building towards, if that can enhance that growth, we'll be very pleased. We shall see. Even this year is not over yet. It's hard to comment on next year, but we'll be very pleased if that happens. Ron, I would say we're in the very early innings of seeing upside. I think John mentioned in his prepared remarks that for the exact same scope of work in exact same places, we're able to drive 25% to 50% lower cost on CapEx initiatives and all and more importantly, we can drive at a much faster turnaround. Just if you think through that, the biggest question that we have in front of us, what's the frictional vacancy? Time is much more important than even money, right? Because turnaround time equals to occupancy, equals to your higher NOI, permanently sort of your stabilized NOI. So you just think about that. We're super excited about it. There's a lot going on in the company, but we are excited about, at the end of the day about free cash flow generation. So that's to answer earlier question on balance sheet, I mentioned that just think through where free cash flow generation will be when we get to your definition of frictional vacancy. So we're excited about it. We're driving cash flow at the end of the day, that's all that matters and we think we're in the very early inning of that. There's a lot to come. So first, let's talk about what we disagree. Let's not take example of what exactly you said. I'll tell you, it's much harder to get to 95% than actually stay at 95%. So your basic assumption that it gets harder as you go on the occupancy assumption is exactly opposite of what our assumption is. So that's sort of the number one point. Number two is what is the future growth of senior housing as a business? We will debate that when we get there. Our first goal is, as I mentioned, you probably have picked up on my earlier comments, that as you stabilize assets, your ability to charge or your ability to get to higher RevPOR increases pretty dramatically. Right? So that's basic supply/demand. And so first, our goal is to get the whole portfolio there. And as you know, we're constantly reloading the gun. We're constantly buying lower occupancy buildings. And Nikhil bought a bunch of buildings this quarter that are 40% occupied, 50% occupied. Right? So we have a few years of work ahead of us to get to the portfolio to where we believe frictional vacancy is. And it sounds like you and we have a very different opinion of what the frictional vacancy is. But let's just get there and after that we'll debate what the long-term NOI growth of the business looks like. However, I'll give you a hint to think about on your own. Think about what operational leverage at different level of occupancy is. The NOI growth is a function of at a occupancy level, what your flow through margins are. And as you know, flow through margins goes up as occupancy goes up. Purely that's called operational leverage, right? That's just operating leverage. Once you think through that, you can come to that conclusion yourself. But we're not going to sit here and speculate. We first need to get to the Promised Land. Emily, I'm not going to try to speculate on what percent of that we will be willing to buy. We, as I've said that we don't have an amount in our mind that we want to buy. We're investors, we're not deal junkies. Our entire strategy is based on something very simple, which is want to build regional density and grow with our operating platforms. There are operating partners and as we see one asset at a time and we think about how it fits to the asset that we own in that area, we will make a decision to acquire or not acquire at a price. So it's a very strategic decision, deliberate decision that is taken on one asset at a time. You can see Nikhil said we acquired 7000 units to 82 different communities and we made 82 different deliberate decisions. This is not let's go buy senior living and buy x billion dollars at y percent spread. That's just exactly what we don't do. So I'm not going to sit here and speculate. But I will tell you that we see a lot of motivated counterparties who wants us to help them solve that debt problem and we're happy to do so."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. You may begin. \nMatthew McQueen: Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC.  \n And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. \nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review first quarter business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the operational performance of our senior housing and outpatient medical portfolios. Nikhil will give you an update on the investment landscape. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and guidance update.  \n I'm very pleased with the strong start to the year as we delivered nearly 19% year-over-year growth in FFO per share with contributions from all parts of our businesses, but I remain particularly excited about our senior housing business, which continues to surpass our expectations. \n Despite continued uncertainty with respect to the direction of the economy and turbulence across many sectors within commercial real estate,  the demand supply backdrop for senior housing gets better with each passing day. We, along with our operating partners are proud yet humbled to provide an important solution for the rapidly growing number of seniors who make the choice to leave in a curated and purpose build environment. And while this demographic driven end market demand continues to strengthen, the new construction remains extraordinarily difficult, pushing off any impact of new supply many years into the future. \n In terms of our Q1 results, we posted another quarter of double-digit same-store revenue growth coming in 10.3%, driven by strong occupancy and rate growth. While Q1 is usually a seasonally weaker period than Q4, same-store occupancy grew 340 basis points year-over-year basis, which represented an improvement from Q4. This is the strongest growth we have seen in our history other than Q1 of 2022, when the comp year was a negative number as we lost occupancy in Q1 of 2021 due to COVID.  \n We also saw outperformance on the rate side. Reported same-store RevPOR or unit revenue growth of 4.8% was dragged down by the leap year impact of an additional day in February, However, adjusting for this extra day, RevPOR growth remained strong at 5.6%. Overall, same-store expenses were up 5.7%, and unit expense or ExpPOR was up 0.4% driven by same-store compensation expenses up 5.4% or just 0.1% on an occupied room basis. Reported ExpPOR was understated because of the leap year impact and otherwise would be up 0.9%.  \n Regardless, we are very pleased with the underlying trends as unit revenue growth far outpaced unit expense growth resulting in another quarter of significant margin expansion. And this combination of strong revenue and moderating expense drove same-store net operating income growth of 25.5% marking  of the strongest quarter in our history. This growth was broad-based with all 3 regions posting year-over-year same-store NOI growth in excess of 20% with growth in the U.K. reaching nearly 50%.  \n From a product standpoint, our independent living and wellness housing portfolios delivered another quarter of extraordinary growth. but our assisted living continued a streak of strong outperformance. And as for our non-same-store pool, we're even more pleased with the performance of these assets as numerous properties we transitioned within past year have seen a strong improvement in performance, while some recent acquisitions have also outperformed. \n We continue to mine for opportunities within our own portfolios to effectuate farther triple-net to RIDEA conversion or of operator transition in an effort to enhance the resident and employee experience, where we believe financial performance will eventually follow. \n We are confident that this informational feedback loop created through this continual focus on employee and customer is a long-term driver of lower risk and superior operational returns. We don't always get the community and the manager combination right in the first go, but it is our responsibility to try again. Status quo is not an option for us. \n Speaking of conversions, I'm pleased to inform you that we are in process of converting 8 additional well-located communities from triple-net to RIDEA. Despite short-term drag, we believe this action will be significantly additive to our full cycle stabilized earnings as we have demonstrated in our recent transaction with Legend. These capital-light transactions and others similarly made in 2023 will create significant growth for us in '25 and beyond.  \n Speaking of transactions, the capital markets backdrop remains very conducive to deploying capital. Since the beginning of the year, we have closed or under contract to close $2.8 billion of investments across 23 separate transactions, including $1.1 billion, which we spoke to in February, mostly made up of the Affinity transaction. \n These investments are predominantly with our repeat counterparties or existing operators. As excited as we are about this record level of activity in just first 4 months of the year, we remain incredibly busy parsing through granular opportunities in both the U.S. as well as the U.K.  \n Our near-term capital deployment pipeline remains robust, highly visible, actionable and squarely within our circle of confidence where we can bet with the house odds rather than the gamblers' odds. As rates and credit space continue to march higher, our telephones are ringing off the hook as we are requested to provide solutions to institutions, families, operators and other sellers. 2024 will be a very active year for us. \n While I wrote extensively about our apathy towards entity-level M&A transactions in our -- in my annual letter, our enthusiasm remains unbridled for tuck-in acquisitions one asset at a time, while we can invest at an attractive basis with operational upside and irreplicable uplift from Welltower's operating platform. \n As we have said in the past, our goal is to achieve significant regional density seeking to grow deep in our market, not broad. And with the help of our data science platform Alpha, we're able to identify one asset at a time, which not only have the strongest growth prospects but also the strongest fit to our portfolio. \n Though we occasionally come across sellers who are disconnected from asset value as they appear to be living in a time capsule of yesterday's interest environment are simply hoping that we'll be back there soon. Many more pragmatic and smart institutions and families realize that perhaps hope is not a strategy, especially in face of a looming wall of debt maturity for the industry and [ data ] financing options. We continue to provide solutions to counterparties who want a sophisticated and reliable partner who shows up at the closing table without a fail with cash and operating partners. We at Welltower are in a handshake business and will remain so.\n Our stellar reputation is much more valuable to us than a few basis points here and there that we may leave on the table. After all, our NorthStar remains long-term compounding of par share value of our existing shareholders not to maximize the deal [ for  ]a quarter. In the end, time is the friend of wonderful companies that compound and the enemy of the mediocre. \n With that, I'll pass it over to John. John? \nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Shankh.. Momentum that continues to build in our business through 2023 has carried into the early part of this year, as reflected by our strong first quarter results. Our total portfolio generated 12.9% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, once again, led by the senior housing operating business. \n First, I'll comment on our outpatient medical portfolio, which remains very stable, producing year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 2% for the first quarter of 2024. Leasing activity remains healthy, and our retention rate once again exceeded 90% leading to consistent and industry-leading same-store occupancy of nearly 95%. The full year same-store NOI guidance is unchanged between 2% and 3%. \n As for the senior housing operating portfolio, our results remain impressive. The 25.5% first quarter year-over-year same-store NOI increase represents the sixth consecutive quarter, in which growth has exceeded 20%. Our top line growth came in at 10.3%, driven by strong occupancy growth of 340 basis points and strong rate growth of 480 basis points. All 3 of our regions continue to show favorable same-store revenue growth, starting with Canada at 9.1%, and the U.S. and the U.K. growing at 10.1% and 14.8%, respectively. Additionally, expense growth continues to moderate, up 5.7% year-over-year with the broader inflationary pressures continuing to abate. \n In terms of labor-related trends, we've not only seen broader macro pressures continue to ease, but also our various property and portfolio level initiatives have been paying off. For example, by creating greater regional density within our senior housing portfolio, employees are able to fill open shifts at other regional properties, reducing the usage of agency labor and improving the overall customer experience. \n Regional densification also creates more opportunities for career progression and lower turnover as employees can take increasing levels of responsibility at different properties managed by the same operator in the same region. And equally important, through the build-out of our operating platform, we're beginning to create efficiencies, which will allow for more time to be set on resident care, improving the customer experience, reducing the administrative burden and related stress on site employees. \n Shifting back to the quarter, we reported 320 basis points year-over-year improvement in margins as unit revenue growth continues to solidly outpace unit expense growth. While NOI margins are below pre-COVID levels, the significant operating leverage inherent in our business and benefits of our operating platform should allow for multiple years of further margin expansion ahead. This year is still young, with peak leasing season ahead of us, but we remain encouraged by the start of this year. Ultimately, our Q1 numbers speak to the great work that the entire team is doing. \n We are relentlessly focused on improving the customer experience and employee experience and we'll continue to pursue operational excellence. Thank you, Team Welltower, including our operators, WellTower employees and vendors. \n I'll now turn the call over to Nikhil. \nNikhil Chaudhri: Thanks, John. Before speaking to our recent investment activity, I wanted to share some high-level market observations. As we have indicated before, we are in a unique environment in which business fundamentals are very strong, and at the same time, the opportunity to deploy capital remains extremely compelling. \n In large part, this backdrop is a function of the challenged seniors housing debt, which sits on the balance sheet of the largest lenders in the space. While we have previously spoken about the $19 billion of seniors housing debt maturing this year and next, a deeper look into the performance of these loans is helpful. \n A great case study is Fannie Mae's senior housing debt book, with a total outstanding principal balance of $16 billion. It's worth noting that borrowers typically seek out agency financing upon stabilization. And so a vast majority of these loans are for assets that were previously stabilized at some point. Of these $16 billion of loans, $5.9 billion are subject to floating rates. But despite that, 44% or $7 billion of Fannie senior housing book is considered criticized, suggesting loans with high risk of default. \n In addition, over $1.1 billion of loans are more than 60 days past due. While the agencies are the lender of choice for stabilized product, borrowers typically seek out banks for riskier development and lease-up bridge loans. Unlike agency loans, these loans are almost always based on floating rates and have shorter durations. \n While granular information is hard to find on the status of these loans on bank balance sheet, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that at least a similar percentage or almost 50% of the $20 billion plus senior housing loans on bank balance sheets are showing similar distress. In fact, as I listened to first quarter earnings call, several regional banks that have historically been among the most active in the seniors housing space, I heard a consistent theme of concerns about their sector exposure and the desire to reduce it. This is not surprising given the poor performance of these loans over the last 5 years. \n Given the staggering level of maturing and underperforming loans, current borrowers are left with tough choices. On one side, borrowers can capitulate and accept the ultimate downside of losing a significant portion or perhaps even all of their equity. On the other side, for those with staying power and the right set of incentives to continue to come out of pocket for incremental capital to service and rightsize the debt load with the hope that some combination of continued improvement in asset level performance and a reversal in the trajectory of interest rates will allow them to achieve a meaningfully better exit value over time. \n Perhaps unsurprisingly, with inflation showing signs of reacceleration over the last few prints and interest rates rising, the hope trade for a quick reversal in the trajectory of interest rates is dwindling and counterparties are coming back to us in droves with the hope of achieving an outcome somewhere in between the 2 extremes I just highlighted. \n Given our reputation of being solutions-oriented and creative dealmakers that honor our original price through the course of the transaction, we continue to be the counterparty of choice for motivated sellers, seeking surety of execution and continue to engage with repeat sellers on follow-on transactions. \n During the first quarter, we completed gross investments of $449 million, comprising $241 million of development funding and acquisitions and loan funding of $208 million, comprised solely of seniors and wellness housing property types. We acquired 3 senior housing communities with an average age of 8 years for $158,000 per unit. We also received repayments of $36 million across 3 outstanding loans over the course of the quarter. \n In addition to the transactions closed in the first quarter, we are currently under contract or have closed on $2.6 billion of gross investments across 15 different transactions spanning 146 properties across the U.S., U.K. and Canada. These transactions have a median value of $37 million. As Shankh mentioned earlier, we are sticking to our mantra of building regional density through focused and granular transactions, and continue to grow with operators that are producing strong results for us in these markets. \n Our recent activity includes incremental new business with our partners at Oakmont, Cogir, Sagora, Discovery, Liberty, LCB and Healthcare Ireland to name a few. I'll end by extending a warm and heartfelt thank you to our best in business investment team located across our offices in Dallas, L.A., London, New York, Toledo and Toronto. We have been fortunate to be able to hire, train and retain the brightest young minds from leading universities across the country year in and year out, while many other competitors eliminated or drastically reduced their teams during COVID. \n We had the foresight to plan the seeds of talent many years ago and are now able to enjoy the fruits from the trees that has since grown. While on one hand, the work at Welltower is incredibly challenging, fast pace and perhaps never ending. On the other hand, I believe that the training, opportunity, autonomy and accelerated career growth are unparalleled. The dedication, thoughtfulness and integrity exhibited by the professionals on our team is all inspiring. I couldn't be more proud of our team or more excited about the opportunity ahead of us. \n I'll now hand the call over to Tim to walk through our financial results. \nTim McHugh: Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our first quarter results. The performance of our total investment segments, our capital activity, a balance sheet and liquidity update, and finally, an update to our full year 2024 outlook. \n Welltower reported first quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.22 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $1.01 per diluted share, representing 18.8% year-over-year growth. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 12.9% year-over-year. \n Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats were reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31, 2023. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 3.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.02x, which marks the first time this coverage has moved above 1x since the pandemic began impacting the segment. \n Next, same-store NOI and our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3.1% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is 1.23x. Staying with the long-term post-acute portfolio, the Integra Healthcare JV entered our same-store pool and coverage metrics this quarter. As a reminder, the 147 properties were put into a master lease in 4Q 2022 and the individual assets will then transition to local and regional operators over the following 5 quarters. The entire master lease enters the same-store pool this quarter while the individual assets will enter the rent coverage metrics as they complete 5 quarters of operations under their respective operators. \n In Q1, 95 of the 147 assets entered our coverage metrics with trailing 12-month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage of 1.58x and 1.13x, respectively. As we've noted on previous calls, the Integra portfolio experienced continuous upward trend in cash flow over last year, as reflected in the trailing 3-month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverages for these 95 assets at 2.23x and 1.74x, respectively. As we move through the year, the rolling forward of last year's positive operating recovery as well as the addition of the remaining transition Integra assets into coverage pool, should lead to a continual upward trend in our coverage metrics throughout 2024. \n Turning to capital activity. As Nikhil just walked us through, we have $2.8 billion of closed or announced investments year-to-date, inclusive of the Affinity transaction announced last quarter. In the quarter, we continue to fund investment activity via equity issuance, raising $2.4 billion of gross proceeds at an average price of $91.22 per share. This allowed us to fund investment activity, along with the extinguishment of approximately $1.5 billion of debt in the quarter, including $1.35 billion of senior unsecured notes and ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash and restricted cash on the balance sheet. \n Staying with the balance sheet. On the third anniversary of our COVID leverage maxing out in the mid-7s ex-COVID relief funds in the first quarter of 2021, [ rented ] this quarter at 4.03x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. And we expect to end the year at a target leverage of approximately 4.5x net debt to EBITDA implied by last night's full year guidance update. \n Consistent with past commentary on the balance sheet, I want to underscore that while our key credit metrics are at historical levels, over half of our NOI is represented by senior housing operating portfolio, which currently sits at just 82.5% occupancy, with NOI still well below pre-COVID levels. As NOI recovers back to pre-pandemic levels, the meaningful recovery in cash flow is expected to drive debt-to-EBITDA below 4x from projected year-end 2024 levels, further enhancing our financial position and access to capital. \n Lastly, as I move on to last night's update to our full year 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not include any investment activity in our outlook beyond the $2.8 billion to date that has been closed or publicly announced. Last night, we updated our full year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to $1.48 to $1.61 per diluted share. And normalized FFO of $4.02 to $4.15 per diluted share or $4.085 at the midpoint. \n The incremental increase of $0.065 from prior normalized FFO guidance per share at the midpoint, is composed of $0.03 from an improved NOI outlook in our senior housing operating portfolio and $0.055 from accretive investments and financing activities, offset partially by $0.01 from higher G&A expectations and $0.01 of near-term drag due to a triple-net [ through day ] conversion. \n Underlying this increased FFO guidance is an increase in estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth to 9% to 12%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%; long-term post-acute, 2% to 3%; senior housing triple-net, 2.5% to 4%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 17% to 22%. The midpoint of which is driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.2%, made up of RevPOR growth of approximately 5.25% and year-over-year occupancy growth of 290 basis points and total expense growth of approximately 6%. \n And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. \nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Tim. While we are very pleased with our execution thus far in the year, we're on the cusp of all important summer leasing season. So let's see what the market gives us. And while we are proud of our recent operating results we have reported, it's important to recognize that it's not by happenstance. This is not a commodity business with a narrow range of outcomes. \n Our results are a function of capital allocation and portfolio management decisions of yesterday. To paraphrase buffet, someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. Similarly, capital allocation decisions of today will drive operating performance tomorrow. \n So even after nearly $15 billion of capital that we have deployed since the depth of COVID and hundreds of communities undergoing operator transition, we still have our hands full to optimize location, product, price point and operators on the asset side of the balance sheet. \n On the liability side, under Tim's leadership, we're absolutely hitting it out of the park. A sharp improvement in cash flow, coupled with our recent capital raising efforts, has driven a net debt to adjusted EBITDA down to 4x, which represents the lowest level in our recorded history. In the very short term, we maintained significant dry powder with over $6 billion of total near-term liquidity to pursue attractive capital deployment opportunities and fund other near-term obligations.\n In the medium term, we have built significant debt capacity to take advantage of when we eventually get to the other side of the Fed cycle and still maintain an extremely strong balance sheet. Said another way, we don't believe that one's balance sheet should be viewed as an object of vanity, but instead as a countercyclical tool to prudently tap into to drive par share growth. \n Our balance sheet was one of the 5 pillars of growth, which I articulated during our last call. And while I won't repeat all the 5 of those pillars today, I'll just reiterate that our confidence in delivering outsized levels of our share growth to our existing shareholders remain as strong as ever. And while we are fortunate to have a strong multi-decade tailwind at our back, just note that we will not settle for the beta of the business, and instead, we are committed to creating significant Alpha again for our existing shareholders with a years of compounding growth ahead of us. We appreciate your support. \n With that, I'll open the call up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. \nRonald Kamdem: Great. Just starting with the SHOP guidance range -- guidance rate almost 20%. Looking at the assumptions, it looks like the occupancy and RevPOR assumptions haven't really changed, and it was really sort of same-store expense driven. So I was just wondering if you could comment on some conservatism is baked into that? And any early indication in the peak leasing season? \nShankh Mitra: Ron, as we have indicated, this is too early in the year. Just as you know, our annual results will be pretty much defined by what the summer leasing season gives us. You know we have -- though while we're pleased with what we have seen in the year, there's this healthy level of paranoia in our team. We don't know what the market will give us. We'll report to you. \n Our promise to you remains that we'll get more than our fair share of the market, but we need to see what the market gives us, and we'll update you in 90 days, and we'll see where we land. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Mizuho. \nVikram Malhotra: Maybe, Shankh and Tim, just -- can you just talk about perhaps your outlook for underlying FAD growth. FFO was strong, but FAD growth was even stronger in the quarter. Just how do you see FAD trending? And if you can dovetail that into the dividend, your coverage is very, very healthy. So I'm just wondering how do you use those free cash flow proceeds or perhaps even grow the dividend. \nTim McHugh: Yes, Vikram. On the FAD side, we've had an ongoing conversation around this just FAD growth. And we continue to focus on the long term. On the CapEx side, growing an internal or internalizing our capital management team and growing that team has been a main initiative over the last 1.5 years. And so as we've done that, we've continued to identify value-add projects, it's really attractive basically returns. And so CapEx, probably a bit elevated here from a long-term run rate. But is helping drive cash flow alongside of it. And as long as we continue to see those opportunities, we'll continue to put capital to work. \n On the dividend part of the question, I'll start, and I'll let Shankh add anything. But when we cut the dividend at start a COVID, we referenced cash flow as being the main driver of our dividend policy. And so that hasn't changed. And so as we sit here today, not only is cash flow recovered pretty meaningfully from the COVID lows. So too is our confidence around the ongoing recovery in senior housing, and that was reflected with our updated guidance last night. So consistent with past commentary on the topic and our current financial position, you should expect that our current dividend policy is something we're actively discussing with our Board of Directors. \nShankh Mitra: I have nothing to add to that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. \nNicholas Yulico: Just a 2-parter here on the acquisitions. In terms of the $2.6 billion, closed under contract. Can you give us a feel for the first year stabilized yield -- sorry, first year yield and then ultimate stabilized yield expectation. And then -- is any of the distress in the market or the higher interest rates pushing up yields on new investments?\n And then just in terms of the funding, so I just want to be clear. It seems like you've already sort of raised the equity to fund that pipeline. But going forward, how should we think about an equity versus debt mix for additional investments since you do seem under-leveraged right now? \nTim McHugh: Nick, I'll take the first part. So on the $2.6 billion, it's 100% senior housing and wellness housing. And if you look at the spot capital markets environment today is very similar to what it did in the fourth quarter as interest rates had run up, so we'll provide more disclosure next quarter as these transactions have closed, but you can expect the return profile to look very similar, both in terms of going in and stabilized yield as what we had in the fourth quarter. \nShankh Mitra: Yes. Nick, you are correct that we have raised capital to close, obviously, all the transactions. I want to make sure that you understand that, that $2.8 billion that we spoke of is not our pipeline, it's the deals that have closed or under contract to close. Our pipeline is beyond that, and it remains a very robust pipeline. That we think are very near-term actionable, we'll see where we end up. But that's sort of our view. Speaking of -- I absolutely subscribe to your view that we remain unleveraged.\n Our goal is to maximize our stabilized our full cycle earnings. And as I mentioned that you should fully expect us to use the balance sheet liability side of our balance sheet to drive significant additional part share growth on the other side of the Fed cycle. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nAustin Wurschmidt: With respect to senior housing operators that have changed their strategy by pushing back the annual rent increases into the earlier part of the key selling season, I guess, how does that trend appear to be playing out so far from a retention perspective? And would you expect that benefit to potentially flow through to new lease rate growth? \nJohn Burkart: Yes. So as it relates to the increases that are going out, there really hasn't been pushback. People understand what's going on in the cost side of the business. They appreciate the value proposition and so that has been going very smoothly. As it relates to market rents, again, we're seeing robust demand out there. So it's -- the 2 are related in the sense of -- obviously, the market drives the overall economics, but the -- it's not that renewals drive the market. The market drives the renewals at some level, and the market is strong. Supply-demand fundamentals work very well and the value proposition is there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James. \nJonathan Hughes: On the increased expected headcount spending this year, can you talk about the investments being made in the analytics and/or operations team and the scaling potential to address the capital deployment opportunities? \nJohn Burkart: Yes. As it relates to the ops team, we are finding tremendous opportunities to build out that team and do things more effectively more efficiently than are currently being done. That's simply a surprise that we can bring operational excellence at our size. And so we continue to lean into that. We're finding that really throughout each of the areas that I'm involved in as it relates to investments [indiscernible]. \nNikhil Chaudhri: Yes. I think, Jonathan, if you think about the sheer number of transactions that we do, but beyond that, everything we look at we can humanly impossible to do that without having incredible tools, right? So that's what -- and you've seen a lot of this, but the tools and the capabilities on our analytics team are the only reason what we do. And so they are an integral part of every step of the investment process from a pretty screen to shift through hundreds of buildings to them be able to predict the stabilized NOI for each building under different operators and find the right operator for those buildings. It's integral to what we're doing. So all the investments that we've made are paying off in space. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. \nJuan Sanabria: I just wanted to ask around the senior housing portfolio that non-same-store pool that Shankh mentioned was doing well. Just curious how many of those -- I think it's nearly 150 assets are in the transitions bucket, not in same-store, will be added over the course of the year. And how are those faring relative to the same-store pool? And should we expect those to be additive to growth as those are folded into same-store? \nShankh Mitra: One, the -- a lot of these early transitions will eventually come into after 5 quarters. So depending on when they were done, they will come towards the end of the year. you should expect strong growth from them, whether they will be additive or not, it's too early to say. Probably, there will be similar growth or they will add to the growth. But it depends also -- remember, they're coming up with strong overlapping strong quarters behind them as well. What was the other part of your question, Juan that I missed? \nJuan Sanabria: That was essentially it. \nTim McHugh: Juan, just on the kind of numbers there, the 159. So the Canadian assets that have transitioned, there's about 62 of those in our transition portfolio. Those transition in the fourth quarter. Those will be -- those will come back in '25, the majority of the rest of them come into the pool of '24. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin of Citi. \nNicholas Joseph: It's Nick here with Michael. You touched on what's happening on the bank side and on the lending side, but also on kind of the long-term drivers and the supply-demand imbalance. So I guess, are you seeing more capital that you're competing with for some of these deals, get more interest in the space? And I guess on the flip side, just on development, obviously, we haven't seen starts bounce back, but are you starting to see anything from a planning stage or any green shoots of supply starting to at least be contemplated? \nNikhil Chaudhri: Yes. Nick, I think the answer to both of those questions is a simple, no. We haven't seen any new capital come into the business. And there's really not much capital out there that is not reliant on the debt market. And the debt markets are just completely [ open ], and then we expect them to continue to be focused for the foreseeable future. And that obviously plays into the development cycle as well. So we've actually seen the opposite rather than folks take on new predevelopment and new potential projects, folks are giving us on products that they're previously pursuing, disbanding teams and all of that. So to answer your questions. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. \nJoshua Dennerlein: John, I wanted to follow up on a comment you made on the operating platform and how a big part of the strategy is to create efficiencies to reduce the admin burden and put more time into care. I was hoping you could elaborate on where you are in building out this capability. And just in general, just provide more color on this aspect of the operating platform. \nJohn Burkart: Yes, absolutely. I would rather quite honestly about it, we're getting very close. There's not a lot of detailed updates to give other than we're right on plan right now. As it relates to the types of savings we expect and that we're identifying pretty substantial when you look at how a person starts as a prospect and move through the process ultimately into the community reducing the paperwork pretty dramatically, reducing the repetition of input of information because the system is a singular unified system. And so all of that reduces errors. It reduces wasted admin time and really enable senior people like the nursing teams, like the executive directors and others and sales teams to really focus on their job and leverage technology to drive value there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. \nMichael Carroll: I guess, John, sticking with you, can you provide some color on the performance of the Cogir, PLR portfolio in Canada? I mean how has that relationship worked so far? And are there plans or discussions to kind of create new PLR relationships to kind of build off of the structure in different parts of the market? \nJohn Burkart: Yes, I'll start with the broader question as far as plans for broader PLR, our focus is and always has been to drive value from a customer employee perspective and, of course, from a shareholder perspective. So it's not the process to say, let's create, a bunch of those types of partnerships. The objective is to drive value. In this case, the value is substantial. Our partner, Cogir and my partner, Frederick, are fantastic to work with. That is doing very, very well. The assets have embraced Cogir -- the teams have embraced Cogir and Cogir management -- and we're very satisfied and appreciative to all the work that is being done there. \n Our expectations of that portfolio will perform fantastically this year. Of course, this transition has occurred during the quiet period. So it's not a lot of activity as it relates to leasing. It's just starting at this point in time up in Canada. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert of Evercore. \nJames Kammert: It looks like there's some real standouts on the senior housing side among your larger operators in terms of in-place NOI contributions. I mean, Sunrise was up 30% sequentially, Oakmont 11%, StoryPoint 19%, et cetera. And John, you speak to sort of the benefits of densification and regional operators, was such gains in the NOI really driven more by that, do you think in best practices? Or was this more of a cyclical episodic each portfolio in terms of NOI advances traditional occupancy, et cetera gains? \nShankh Mitra: We're not going to give on specific operator-level performance on this call, which we never do. I'm not going to start that today. We'll tell you that it was a very broad-based outperformance from all of our operators, across 3 regions. And obviously, that's not -- as I said, is a happenstance, right? Some of the operating partners, you mentioned have done terrifically well for us over a long period of time, and that continues. But this is a very deliberate strategy that we put together years ago to go deep and not go broad. And that's as we continue to double down on this strategy.\n And John gave several examples of that, that plays out, whether that's on the employee retention side, their long-term career and others. And that's also true, we can give you several examples how that plays out, obviously, on the revenue side where customers have different options within a close proximity to each other, right? So at the end of the day, that's what we are trying to do. We believe, as many of us mentioned on the call, that great customer and employee experience eventually drive great financial results. And we continue to double down on the simple strategy. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. \nMichael Mueller: Tim, a quick question. Was there a change in the same-store operating expense guidance for show? Because it looks like your same-store revenue drivers didn't change, but the NOI growth expectation increased? \nTim McHugh: Yes. Thanks, Mike. It did. So our expense -- our overall expense that were underlying our initial budget were 6.5%. So our revised outlook today moving down to 6% and the change 50 basis points lower. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski of Green Street. \nJohn Pawlowski: Nikhil, when your team's underwriting new skilled nursing investments, can you give me a sense for kind of a range of EBITDA reductions you're potentially contemplating in your underwriting for staff mandates [indiscernible]. \nNikhil Chaudhri: Yes. I think, John, in the skilled business, we are essentially structured credit, short-duration providers of capital. And we're super focused on basis and [indiscernible] beyond that. And so at the basis we play out, it doesn't really have a meaningful impact just given the downside protection we have. I think this question is probably a better question for folks that play [indiscernible]. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of Wedbush Securities. \nRichard Anderson: Great quarter. It keeps getting better and better. Shankh, used the word were abundant amount of paranoia in the company, which is good to hear. And I want to sort of tackle that side. I'm sure that you focus not only on the opportunities, which you're clearly doing but also on the potential risks that can materialize. And think of a company like Prologis obviously, like you and industry thought leader, but down 21% this year and trading near its 2-year low. How does Welltower anticipate potential pitfalls that may materialize. Some of the things that you're thinking about to manage around today, to your point, about deploying capital and making sure that it produces the end results that you're envisioning. \n I'm thinking about 25% same-store NOI growth and how someone might say why is Wall Street getting rich at the expense of seniors? Is there a rent control conversation potentially out there? I'm just wondering some of the things that frame your paranoia and how you might respond to that? \nShankh Mitra: Thank you, Rich. I said a healthy amount of paranoia and we do, and we're constantly thinking -- constantly looking over a shoulder to think what can go wrong. Now let's talk about numbers. The law of numbers are very unforgiving, right? When your NOI goes down by 50%, $100 become $50, you need to go up 100% to go back to just where you started, right? So while 25% NOI growth is impressive, let's just be honest, like I think I said this in an industry conference a few months ago that we haven't made any money over the last 10 years as an industry. So while year-over-year numbers are impressive. We got to understand the basic numbers. Just to go back to where we started as an industry. And if NOI was -- let's just say it was down 50%, somewhere down 40%, but somewhere on cut in half, and that's what will happen if you lose 20 points of occupancy you need to just go back 100% to go back to a high watermark.\n So if you put that in perspective, you realize that, obviously, the profitability of the industry remains pretty challenging. And you can see that in the margins. Margins remain significantly below where pre-COVID and frankly speaking, the peak of this business was not pre-COVID, was peak of the business was 2015 in last, call it, 1.5 decades and we're not even close to that. \n So all these points that you're raising, which are very good points are very interrelated, right? If we can't get to a basic level of margins, that will obviously be driven by basic level of rates and occupancy, then investments, particularly new investment going back to Nick's question on development doesn't make any sense. You need to attract capital to invest in the existing community doesn't make any sense, right? So all of these things are very interrelated. \n We're trying to do the best we can to provide a great level of service to our communities, our residents, our employees. And we also have to put in perspective like a lot of other types of operational real estate apartment stores, single-family rentals, which in the heydays have raised rents 20%,  25-plus percent our rent growth has been good, but it has never been sort of a double-digit plus, right? So it's always sort of hovered around 8%, 9%. That's purely driven by demand supply on one side as well as obviously an escalating cost environment. So we feel good about it. \n We will see where we go from here as we are talking about this kind of rate growth. Also, I would like you to remember that just on a same employee basis, rates in the sort of cost of employees are up 30%, 40% in the last 5 years, right? So all of these things come into play. We're always looking over our shareholder. You can see how we're managing our balance sheet. Prologis is a terrific company. It will continue to be a terrific company regardless whether the stock is down in a given year or not. They've created a massive amount of value over the years. Stock goes up and down. That's not as managed as we control. Our responsibility is to manage the business and look for opportunities to create long-term value. Short term -- okay. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of Baird. \nWesley Golladay: For that $19 billion opportunity over the next 2 years, is that a domestic opportunity only? And can you highlight what you're seeing in the U.K. and Canada? \nShankh Mitra: Yes, that is a domestic number we're talking about. We are seeing similar situations in our international markets. And one of them where particularly that market is challenged is U.K. and we're seeing significant opportunities in the U.K. And I think I mentioned that. And I think you will see us many granular transactions in U.K. this year to take advantage of that. Lack of credit, real estate -- health care real estate credit in U.K. If it is possible to be worse than the U.S., which is very hard today, it's probably U.K. market, debt market is worse than that of U.K. today. I mean U.K. debt market is worse than that of U.S. today. \nOperator: With no further questions, that concludes today's Q&A session. We thank you for your attendance. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nikhil Chaudhri",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Before speaking to our recent investment activity, I wanted to share some high-level market observations. As we have indicated before, we are in a unique environment in which business fundamentals are very strong, and at the same time, the opportunity to deploy capital remains extremely compelling. \n In large part, this backdrop is a function of the challenged seniors housing debt, which sits on the balance sheet of the largest lenders in the space. While we have previously spoken about the $19 billion of seniors housing debt maturing this year and next, a deeper look into the performance of these loans is helpful. \n A great case study is Fannie Mae's senior housing debt book, with a total outstanding principal balance of $16 billion. It's worth noting that borrowers typically seek out agency financing upon stabilization. And so a vast majority of these loans are for assets that were previously stabilized at some point. Of these $16 billion of loans, $5.9 billion are subject to floating rates. But despite that, 44% or $7 billion of Fannie senior housing book is considered criticized, suggesting loans with high risk of default. \n In addition, over $1.1 billion of loans are more than 60 days past due. While the agencies are the lender of choice for stabilized product, borrowers typically seek out banks for riskier development and lease-up bridge loans. Unlike agency loans, these loans are almost always based on floating rates and have shorter durations. \n While granular information is hard to find on the status of these loans on bank balance sheet, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that at least a similar percentage or almost 50% of the $20 billion plus senior housing loans on bank balance sheets are showing similar distress. In fact, as I listened to first quarter earnings call, several regional banks that have historically been among the most active in the seniors housing space, I heard a consistent theme of concerns about their sector exposure and the desire to reduce it. This is not surprising given the poor performance of these loans over the last 5 years. \n Given the staggering level of maturing and underperforming loans, current borrowers are left with tough choices. On one side, borrowers can capitulate and accept the ultimate downside of losing a significant portion or perhaps even all of their equity. On the other side, for those with staying power and the right set of incentives to continue to come out of pocket for incremental capital to service and rightsize the debt load with the hope that some combination of continued improvement in asset level performance and a reversal in the trajectory of interest rates will allow them to achieve a meaningfully better exit value over time. \n Perhaps unsurprisingly, with inflation showing signs of reacceleration over the last few prints and interest rates rising, the hope trade for a quick reversal in the trajectory of interest rates is dwindling and counterparties are coming back to us in droves with the hope of achieving an outcome somewhere in between the 2 extremes I just highlighted. \n Given our reputation of being solutions-oriented and creative dealmakers that honor our original price through the course of the transaction, we continue to be the counterparty of choice for motivated sellers, seeking surety of execution and continue to engage with repeat sellers on follow-on transactions. \n During the first quarter, we completed gross investments of $449 million, comprising $241 million of development funding and acquisitions and loan funding of $208 million, comprised solely of seniors and wellness housing property types. We acquired 3 senior housing communities with an average age of 8 years for $158,000 per unit. We also received repayments of $36 million across 3 outstanding loans over the course of the quarter. \n In addition to the transactions closed in the first quarter, we are currently under contract or have closed on $2.6 billion of gross investments across 15 different transactions spanning 146 properties across the U.S., U.K. and Canada. These transactions have a median value of $37 million. As Shankh mentioned earlier, we are sticking to our mantra of building regional density through focused and granular transactions, and continue to grow with operators that are producing strong results for us in these markets. \n Our recent activity includes incremental new business with our partners at Oakmont, Cogir, Sagora, Discovery, Liberty, LCB and Healthcare Ireland to name a few. I'll end by extending a warm and heartfelt thank you to our best in business investment team located across our offices in Dallas, L.A., London, New York, Toledo and Toronto. We have been fortunate to be able to hire, train and retain the brightest young minds from leading universities across the country year in and year out, while many other competitors eliminated or drastically reduced their teams during COVID. \n We had the foresight to plan the seeds of talent many years ago and are now able to enjoy the fruits from the trees that has since grown. While on one hand, the work at Welltower is incredibly challenging, fast pace and perhaps never ending. On the other hand, I believe that the training, opportunity, autonomy and accelerated career growth are unparalleled. The dedication, thoughtfulness and integrity exhibited by the professionals on our team is all inspiring. I couldn't be more proud of our team or more excited about the opportunity ahead of us. \n I'll now hand the call over to Tim to walk through our financial results. Yes. I think, Jonathan, if you think about the sheer number of transactions that we do, but beyond that, everything we look at we can humanly impossible to do that without having incredible tools, right? So that's what -- and you've seen a lot of this, but the tools and the capabilities on our analytics team are the only reason what we do. And so they are an integral part of every step of the investment process from a pretty screen to shift through hundreds of buildings to them be able to predict the stabilized NOI for each building under different operators and find the right operator for those buildings. It's integral to what we're doing. So all the investments that we've made are paying off in space. Yes. Nick, I think the answer to both of those questions is a simple, no. We haven't seen any new capital come into the business. And there's really not much capital out there that is not reliant on the debt market. And the debt markets are just completely [ open ], and then we expect them to continue to be focused for the foreseeable future. And that obviously plays into the development cycle as well. So we've actually seen the opposite rather than folks take on new predevelopment and new potential projects, folks are giving us on products that they're previously pursuing, disbanding teams and all of that. So to answer your questions. Yes. I think, John, in the skilled business, we are essentially structured credit, short-duration providers of capital. And we're super focused on basis and [indiscernible] beyond that. And so at the basis we play out, it doesn't really have a meaningful impact just given the downside protection we have. I think this question is probably a better question for folks that play [indiscernible]."

            "content": "Thank you, Shankh.. Momentum that continues to build in our business through 2023 has carried into the early part of this year, as reflected by our strong first quarter results. Our total portfolio generated 12.9% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, once again, led by the senior housing operating business. \n First, I'll comment on our outpatient medical portfolio, which remains very stable, producing year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 2% for the first quarter of 2024. Leasing activity remains healthy, and our retention rate once again exceeded 90% leading to consistent and industry-leading same-store occupancy of nearly 95%. The full year same-store NOI guidance is unchanged between 2% and 3%. \n As for the senior housing operating portfolio, our results remain impressive. The 25.5% first quarter year-over-year same-store NOI increase represents the sixth consecutive quarter, in which growth has exceeded 20%. Our top line growth came in at 10.3%, driven by strong occupancy growth of 340 basis points and strong rate growth of 480 basis points. All 3 of our regions continue to show favorable same-store revenue growth, starting with Canada at 9.1%, and the U.S. and the U.K. growing at 10.1% and 14.8%, respectively. Additionally, expense growth continues to moderate, up 5.7% year-over-year with the broader inflationary pressures continuing to abate. \n In terms of labor-related trends, we've not only seen broader macro pressures continue to ease, but also our various property and portfolio level initiatives have been paying off. For example, by creating greater regional density within our senior housing portfolio, employees are able to fill open shifts at other regional properties, reducing the usage of agency labor and improving the overall customer experience. \n Regional densification also creates more opportunities for career progression and lower turnover as employees can take increasing levels of responsibility at different properties managed by the same operator in the same region. And equally important, through the build-out of our operating platform, we're beginning to create efficiencies, which will allow for more time to be set on resident care, improving the customer experience, reducing the administrative burden and related stress on site employees. \n Shifting back to the quarter, we reported 320 basis points year-over-year improvement in margins as unit revenue growth continues to solidly outpace unit expense growth. While NOI margins are below pre-COVID levels, the significant operating leverage inherent in our business and benefits of our operating platform should allow for multiple years of further margin expansion ahead. This year is still young, with peak leasing season ahead of us, but we remain encouraged by the start of this year. Ultimately, our Q1 numbers speak to the great work that the entire team is doing. \n We are relentlessly focused on improving the customer experience and employee experience and we'll continue to pursue operational excellence. Thank you, Team Welltower, including our operators, WellTower employees and vendors. \n I'll now turn the call over to Nikhil. Yes. So as it relates to the increases that are going out, there really hasn't been pushback. People understand what's going on in the cost side of the business. They appreciate the value proposition and so that has been going very smoothly. As it relates to market rents, again, we're seeing robust demand out there. So it's -- the 2 are related in the sense of -- obviously, the market drives the overall economics, but the -- it's not that renewals drive the market. The market drives the renewals at some level, and the market is strong. Supply-demand fundamentals work very well and the value proposition is there. Yes. As it relates to the ops team, we are finding tremendous opportunities to build out that team and do things more effectively more efficiently than are currently being done. That's simply a surprise that we can bring operational excellence at our size. And so we continue to lean into that. We're finding that really throughout each of the areas that I'm involved in as it relates to investments [indiscernible]. Yes, absolutely. I would rather quite honestly about it, we're getting very close. There's not a lot of detailed updates to give other than we're right on plan right now. As it relates to the types of savings we expect and that we're identifying pretty substantial when you look at how a person starts as a prospect and move through the process ultimately into the community reducing the paperwork pretty dramatically, reducing the repetition of input of information because the system is a singular unified system. And so all of that reduces errors. It reduces wasted admin time and really enable senior people like the nursing teams, like the executive directors and others and sales teams to really focus on their job and leverage technology to drive value there. Yes, I'll start with the broader question as far as plans for broader PLR, our focus is and always has been to drive value from a customer employee perspective and, of course, from a shareholder perspective. So it's not the process to say, let's create, a bunch of those types of partnerships. The objective is to drive value. In this case, the value is substantial. Our partner, Cogir and my partner, Frederick, are fantastic to work with. That is doing very, very well. The assets have embraced Cogir -- the teams have embraced Cogir and Cogir management -- and we're very satisfied and appreciative to all the work that is being done there. \n Our expectations of that portfolio will perform fantastically this year. Of course, this transition has occurred during the quiet period. So it's not a lot of activity as it relates to leasing. It's just starting at this point in time up in Canada."

            "name": "Shankh Mitra",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review first quarter business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the operational performance of our senior housing and outpatient medical portfolios. Nikhil will give you an update on the investment landscape. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and guidance update.  \n I'm very pleased with the strong start to the year as we delivered nearly 19% year-over-year growth in FFO per share with contributions from all parts of our businesses, but I remain particularly excited about our senior housing business, which continues to surpass our expectations. \n Despite continued uncertainty with respect to the direction of the economy and turbulence across many sectors within commercial real estate,  the demand supply backdrop for senior housing gets better with each passing day. We, along with our operating partners are proud yet humbled to provide an important solution for the rapidly growing number of seniors who make the choice to leave in a curated and purpose build environment. And while this demographic driven end market demand continues to strengthen, the new construction remains extraordinarily difficult, pushing off any impact of new supply many years into the future. \n In terms of our Q1 results, we posted another quarter of double-digit same-store revenue growth coming in 10.3%, driven by strong occupancy and rate growth. While Q1 is usually a seasonally weaker period than Q4, same-store occupancy grew 340 basis points year-over-year basis, which represented an improvement from Q4. This is the strongest growth we have seen in our history other than Q1 of 2022, when the comp year was a negative number as we lost occupancy in Q1 of 2021 due to COVID.  \n We also saw outperformance on the rate side. Reported same-store RevPOR or unit revenue growth of 4.8% was dragged down by the leap year impact of an additional day in February, However, adjusting for this extra day, RevPOR growth remained strong at 5.6%. Overall, same-store expenses were up 5.7%, and unit expense or ExpPOR was up 0.4% driven by same-store compensation expenses up 5.4% or just 0.1% on an occupied room basis. Reported ExpPOR was understated because of the leap year impact and otherwise would be up 0.9%.  \n Regardless, we are very pleased with the underlying trends as unit revenue growth far outpaced unit expense growth resulting in another quarter of significant margin expansion. And this combination of strong revenue and moderating expense drove same-store net operating income growth of 25.5% marking  of the strongest quarter in our history. This growth was broad-based with all 3 regions posting year-over-year same-store NOI growth in excess of 20% with growth in the U.K. reaching nearly 50%.  \n From a product standpoint, our independent living and wellness housing portfolios delivered another quarter of extraordinary growth. but our assisted living continued a streak of strong outperformance. And as for our non-same-store pool, we're even more pleased with the performance of these assets as numerous properties we transitioned within past year have seen a strong improvement in performance, while some recent acquisitions have also outperformed. \n We continue to mine for opportunities within our own portfolios to effectuate farther triple-net to RIDEA conversion or of operator transition in an effort to enhance the resident and employee experience, where we believe financial performance will eventually follow. \n We are confident that this informational feedback loop created through this continual focus on employee and customer is a long-term driver of lower risk and superior operational returns. We don't always get the community and the manager combination right in the first go, but it is our responsibility to try again. Status quo is not an option for us. \n Speaking of conversions, I'm pleased to inform you that we are in process of converting 8 additional well-located communities from triple-net to RIDEA. Despite short-term drag, we believe this action will be significantly additive to our full cycle stabilized earnings as we have demonstrated in our recent transaction with Legend. These capital-light transactions and others similarly made in 2023 will create significant growth for us in '25 and beyond.  \n Speaking of transactions, the capital markets backdrop remains very conducive to deploying capital. Since the beginning of the year, we have closed or under contract to close $2.8 billion of investments across 23 separate transactions, including $1.1 billion, which we spoke to in February, mostly made up of the Affinity transaction. \n These investments are predominantly with our repeat counterparties or existing operators. As excited as we are about this record level of activity in just first 4 months of the year, we remain incredibly busy parsing through granular opportunities in both the U.S. as well as the U.K.  \n Our near-term capital deployment pipeline remains robust, highly visible, actionable and squarely within our circle of confidence where we can bet with the house odds rather than the gamblers' odds. As rates and credit space continue to march higher, our telephones are ringing off the hook as we are requested to provide solutions to institutions, families, operators and other sellers. 2024 will be a very active year for us. \n While I wrote extensively about our apathy towards entity-level M&A transactions in our -- in my annual letter, our enthusiasm remains unbridled for tuck-in acquisitions one asset at a time, while we can invest at an attractive basis with operational upside and irreplicable uplift from Welltower's operating platform. \n As we have said in the past, our goal is to achieve significant regional density seeking to grow deep in our market, not broad. And with the help of our data science platform Alpha, we're able to identify one asset at a time, which not only have the strongest growth prospects but also the strongest fit to our portfolio. \n Though we occasionally come across sellers who are disconnected from asset value as they appear to be living in a time capsule of yesterday's interest environment are simply hoping that we'll be back there soon. Many more pragmatic and smart institutions and families realize that perhaps hope is not a strategy, especially in face of a looming wall of debt maturity for the industry and [ data ] financing options. We continue to provide solutions to counterparties who want a sophisticated and reliable partner who shows up at the closing table without a fail with cash and operating partners. We at Welltower are in a handshake business and will remain so.\n Our stellar reputation is much more valuable to us than a few basis points here and there that we may leave on the table. After all, our NorthStar remains long-term compounding of par share value of our existing shareholders not to maximize the deal [ for  ]a quarter. In the end, time is the friend of wonderful companies that compound and the enemy of the mediocre. \n With that, I'll pass it over to John. John? Thank you, Tim. While we are very pleased with our execution thus far in the year, we're on the cusp of all important summer leasing season. So let's see what the market gives us. And while we are proud of our recent operating results we have reported, it's important to recognize that it's not by happenstance. This is not a commodity business with a narrow range of outcomes. \n Our results are a function of capital allocation and portfolio management decisions of yesterday. To paraphrase buffet, someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. Similarly, capital allocation decisions of today will drive operating performance tomorrow. \n So even after nearly $15 billion of capital that we have deployed since the depth of COVID and hundreds of communities undergoing operator transition, we still have our hands full to optimize location, product, price point and operators on the asset side of the balance sheet. \n On the liability side, under Tim's leadership, we're absolutely hitting it out of the park. A sharp improvement in cash flow, coupled with our recent capital raising efforts, has driven a net debt to adjusted EBITDA down to 4x, which represents the lowest level in our recorded history. In the very short term, we maintained significant dry powder with over $6 billion of total near-term liquidity to pursue attractive capital deployment opportunities and fund other near-term obligations.\n In the medium term, we have built significant debt capacity to take advantage of when we eventually get to the other side of the Fed cycle and still maintain an extremely strong balance sheet. Said another way, we don't believe that one's balance sheet should be viewed as an object of vanity, but instead as a countercyclical tool to prudently tap into to drive par share growth. \n Our balance sheet was one of the 5 pillars of growth, which I articulated during our last call. And while I won't repeat all the 5 of those pillars today, I'll just reiterate that our confidence in delivering outsized levels of our share growth to our existing shareholders remain as strong as ever. And while we are fortunate to have a strong multi-decade tailwind at our back, just note that we will not settle for the beta of the business, and instead, we are committed to creating significant Alpha again for our existing shareholders with a years of compounding growth ahead of us. We appreciate your support. \n With that, I'll open the call up for questions. Ron, as we have indicated, this is too early in the year. Just as you know, our annual results will be pretty much defined by what the summer leasing season gives us. You know we have -- though while we're pleased with what we have seen in the year, there's this healthy level of paranoia in our team. We don't know what the market will give us. We'll report to you. \n Our promise to you remains that we'll get more than our fair share of the market, but we need to see what the market gives us, and we'll update you in 90 days, and we'll see where we land. Thank you. I have nothing to add to that. Yes. Nick, you are correct that we have raised capital to close, obviously, all the transactions. I want to make sure that you understand that, that $2.8 billion that we spoke of is not our pipeline, it's the deals that have closed or under contract to close. Our pipeline is beyond that, and it remains a very robust pipeline. That we think are very near-term actionable, we'll see where we end up. But that's sort of our view. Speaking of -- I absolutely subscribe to your view that we remain unleveraged.\n Our goal is to maximize our stabilized our full cycle earnings. And as I mentioned that you should fully expect us to use the balance sheet liability side of our balance sheet to drive significant additional part share growth on the other side of the Fed cycle. One, the -- a lot of these early transitions will eventually come into after 5 quarters. So depending on when they were done, they will come towards the end of the year. you should expect strong growth from them, whether they will be additive or not, it's too early to say. Probably, there will be similar growth or they will add to the growth. But it depends also -- remember, they're coming up with strong overlapping strong quarters behind them as well. What was the other part of your question, Juan that I missed? We're not going to give on specific operator-level performance on this call, which we never do. I'm not going to start that today. We'll tell you that it was a very broad-based outperformance from all of our operators, across 3 regions. And obviously, that's not -- as I said, is a happenstance, right? Some of the operating partners, you mentioned have done terrifically well for us over a long period of time, and that continues. But this is a very deliberate strategy that we put together years ago to go deep and not go broad. And that's as we continue to double down on this strategy.\n And John gave several examples of that, that plays out, whether that's on the employee retention side, their long-term career and others. And that's also true, we can give you several examples how that plays out, obviously, on the revenue side where customers have different options within a close proximity to each other, right? So at the end of the day, that's what we are trying to do. We believe, as many of us mentioned on the call, that great customer and employee experience eventually drive great financial results. And we continue to double down on the simple strategy. Thank you, Rich. I said a healthy amount of paranoia and we do, and we're constantly thinking -- constantly looking over a shoulder to think what can go wrong. Now let's talk about numbers. The law of numbers are very unforgiving, right? When your NOI goes down by 50%, $100 become $50, you need to go up 100% to go back to just where you started, right? So while 25% NOI growth is impressive, let's just be honest, like I think I said this in an industry conference a few months ago that we haven't made any money over the last 10 years as an industry. So while year-over-year numbers are impressive. We got to understand the basic numbers. Just to go back to where we started as an industry. And if NOI was -- let's just say it was down 50%, somewhere down 40%, but somewhere on cut in half, and that's what will happen if you lose 20 points of occupancy you need to just go back 100% to go back to a high watermark.\n So if you put that in perspective, you realize that, obviously, the profitability of the industry remains pretty challenging. And you can see that in the margins. Margins remain significantly below where pre-COVID and frankly speaking, the peak of this business was not pre-COVID, was peak of the business was 2015 in last, call it, 1.5 decades and we're not even close to that. \n So all these points that you're raising, which are very good points are very interrelated, right? If we can't get to a basic level of margins, that will obviously be driven by basic level of rates and occupancy, then investments, particularly new investment going back to Nick's question on development doesn't make any sense. You need to attract capital to invest in the existing community doesn't make any sense, right? So all of these things are very interrelated. \n We're trying to do the best we can to provide a great level of service to our communities, our residents, our employees. And we also have to put in perspective like a lot of other types of operational real estate apartment stores, single-family rentals, which in the heydays have raised rents 20%,  25-plus percent our rent growth has been good, but it has never been sort of a double-digit plus, right? So it's always sort of hovered around 8%, 9%. That's purely driven by demand supply on one side as well as obviously an escalating cost environment. So we feel good about it. \n We will see where we go from here as we are talking about this kind of rate growth. Also, I would like you to remember that just on a same employee basis, rates in the sort of cost of employees are up 30%, 40% in the last 5 years, right? So all of these things come into play. We're always looking over our shareholder. You can see how we're managing our balance sheet. Prologis is a terrific company. It will continue to be a terrific company regardless whether the stock is down in a given year or not. They've created a massive amount of value over the years. Stock goes up and down. That's not as managed as we control. Our responsibility is to manage the business and look for opportunities to create long-term value. Short term -- okay. Yes, that is a domestic number we're talking about. We are seeing similar situations in our international markets. And one of them where particularly that market is challenged is U.K. and we're seeing significant opportunities in the U.K. And I think I mentioned that. And I think you will see us many granular transactions in U.K. this year to take advantage of that. Lack of credit, real estate -- health care real estate credit in U.K. If it is possible to be worse than the U.S., which is very hard today, it's probably U.K. market, debt market is worse than that of U.K. today. I mean U.K. debt market is worse than that of U.S. today."

            "name": "Tim McHugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our first quarter results. The performance of our total investment segments, our capital activity, a balance sheet and liquidity update, and finally, an update to our full year 2024 outlook. \n Welltower reported first quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.22 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $1.01 per diluted share, representing 18.8% year-over-year growth. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 12.9% year-over-year. \n Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats were reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31, 2023. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 3.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.02x, which marks the first time this coverage has moved above 1x since the pandemic began impacting the segment. \n Next, same-store NOI and our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3.1% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is 1.23x. Staying with the long-term post-acute portfolio, the Integra Healthcare JV entered our same-store pool and coverage metrics this quarter. As a reminder, the 147 properties were put into a master lease in 4Q 2022 and the individual assets will then transition to local and regional operators over the following 5 quarters. The entire master lease enters the same-store pool this quarter while the individual assets will enter the rent coverage metrics as they complete 5 quarters of operations under their respective operators. \n In Q1, 95 of the 147 assets entered our coverage metrics with trailing 12-month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage of 1.58x and 1.13x, respectively. As we've noted on previous calls, the Integra portfolio experienced continuous upward trend in cash flow over last year, as reflected in the trailing 3-month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverages for these 95 assets at 2.23x and 1.74x, respectively. As we move through the year, the rolling forward of last year's positive operating recovery as well as the addition of the remaining transition Integra assets into coverage pool, should lead to a continual upward trend in our coverage metrics throughout 2024. \n Turning to capital activity. As Nikhil just walked us through, we have $2.8 billion of closed or announced investments year-to-date, inclusive of the Affinity transaction announced last quarter. In the quarter, we continue to fund investment activity via equity issuance, raising $2.4 billion of gross proceeds at an average price of $91.22 per share. This allowed us to fund investment activity, along with the extinguishment of approximately $1.5 billion of debt in the quarter, including $1.35 billion of senior unsecured notes and ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash and restricted cash on the balance sheet. \n Staying with the balance sheet. On the third anniversary of our COVID leverage maxing out in the mid-7s ex-COVID relief funds in the first quarter of 2021, [ rented ] this quarter at 4.03x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. And we expect to end the year at a target leverage of approximately 4.5x net debt to EBITDA implied by last night's full year guidance update. \n Consistent with past commentary on the balance sheet, I want to underscore that while our key credit metrics are at historical levels, over half of our NOI is represented by senior housing operating portfolio, which currently sits at just 82.5% occupancy, with NOI still well below pre-COVID levels. As NOI recovers back to pre-pandemic levels, the meaningful recovery in cash flow is expected to drive debt-to-EBITDA below 4x from projected year-end 2024 levels, further enhancing our financial position and access to capital. \n Lastly, as I move on to last night's update to our full year 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not include any investment activity in our outlook beyond the $2.8 billion to date that has been closed or publicly announced. Last night, we updated our full year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to $1.48 to $1.61 per diluted share. And normalized FFO of $4.02 to $4.15 per diluted share or $4.085 at the midpoint. \n The incremental increase of $0.065 from prior normalized FFO guidance per share at the midpoint, is composed of $0.03 from an improved NOI outlook in our senior housing operating portfolio and $0.055 from accretive investments and financing activities, offset partially by $0.01 from higher G&A expectations and $0.01 of near-term drag due to a triple-net [ through day ] conversion. \n Underlying this increased FFO guidance is an increase in estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth to 9% to 12%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%; long-term post-acute, 2% to 3%; senior housing triple-net, 2.5% to 4%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 17% to 22%. The midpoint of which is driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.2%, made up of RevPOR growth of approximately 5.25% and year-over-year occupancy growth of 290 basis points and total expense growth of approximately 6%. \n And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. Yes, Vikram. On the FAD side, we've had an ongoing conversation around this just FAD growth. And we continue to focus on the long term. On the CapEx side, growing an internal or internalizing our capital management team and growing that team has been a main initiative over the last 1.5 years. And so as we've done that, we've continued to identify value-add projects, it's really attractive basically returns. And so CapEx, probably a bit elevated here from a long-term run rate. But is helping drive cash flow alongside of it. And as long as we continue to see those opportunities, we'll continue to put capital to work. \n On the dividend part of the question, I'll start, and I'll let Shankh add anything. But when we cut the dividend at start a COVID, we referenced cash flow as being the main driver of our dividend policy. And so that hasn't changed. And so as we sit here today, not only is cash flow recovered pretty meaningfully from the COVID lows. So too is our confidence around the ongoing recovery in senior housing, and that was reflected with our updated guidance last night. So consistent with past commentary on the topic and our current financial position, you should expect that our current dividend policy is something we're actively discussing with our Board of Directors. Nick, I'll take the first part. So on the $2.6 billion, it's 100% senior housing and wellness housing. And if you look at the spot capital markets environment today is very similar to what it did in the fourth quarter as interest rates had run up, so we'll provide more disclosure next quarter as these transactions have closed, but you can expect the return profile to look very similar, both in terms of going in and stabilized yield as what we had in the fourth quarter. Juan, just on the kind of numbers there, the 159. So the Canadian assets that have transitioned, there's about 62 of those in our transition portfolio. Those transition in the fourth quarter. Those will be -- those will come back in '25, the majority of the rest of them come into the pool of '24. Yes. Thanks, Mike. It did. So our expense -- our overall expense that were underlying our initial budget were 6.5%. So our revised outlook today moving down to 6% and the change 50 basis points lower."
